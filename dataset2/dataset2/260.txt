who be we that be the big question and essentially we be just a upright walk big brained super intelligent ape this could be we we belong to the family call the Hominidae we be the species call Homo sapiens sapiens and it be important to remember that in term of we place in the world today and we future on planet Earth we be one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet Earth today and that be just a tiny fraction of all species that have ever live on the planet in past time we be one species out of approximately or let say at least 16 upright walking ape that have exist over the past six to eight million year but as far as we know we be the only upright walk ape that exist on planet Earth today except for the bonobo and it be important to remember that because the bonobo be so human and they share 99 percent of they gene with we and we share we origin with a handful of the live great ape it be important to remember that we evolve now I know that be a dirty word for some person but we evolve from common ancestor with the gorilla the chimpanzee and also the bonobo we have a common past and we have a common future and it be important to remember that all of this great ape have come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey as we ourselves have today and it be this journey that be of such interest to humanity and it be this journey that have be the focus of the past three generation of my family as we have be in East Africa look for the fossil remains of we ancestor to try and piece together we evolutionary past and this be how we look for they a group of dedicated young man and woman walk very slowly out across vast area of Africa look for small fragment of bone fossil bone that may be on the surface and that be a example of what we may do as we walk across the landscape in Northern Kenya look for fossil I doubt many of you in the audience can see the fossil that be in this picture but if you look very carefully there be a jaw a low jaw of a 4 1 million year old upright walk ape as it be find at Lake Turkana on the west side laughter it be extremely time consume labor intensive and it be something that be go to involve a lot more person to begin to piece together we past we still really have not get a very complete picture of it when we find a fossil we mark it today we have get great technology we have gps we mark it with a gps fix and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen so we could essentially put it back on the surface exactly where we find it and we can bring all this information into big gis package today when we then find something very important like the bone of a human ancestor we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly use dental pick and fine paintbrush and all the sediment be then put through this screen and where we go again through it very carefully look for small bone fragment and it be then wash and this thing be so exciting they be so often the only or the very first time that anybody have ever see the remains and here be a very special moment when my mother and myself be dig up some remains of human ancestor and it be one of the most special thing to ever do with you mother laughter not many person can say that but now let I take you back to Africa two million year ago I would just like to point out if you look at the map of Africa it do actually look like a hominid skull in its shape now we be go to go to the East African and the Rift Valley it essentially run up from the Gulf of Aden or run down to Lake Malawi and the Rift Valley be a depression it be a basin and river flow down from the highland into the basin carry sediment preserve the bone of animal that live there if you want to become a fossil you actually need to die somewhere where you bone will be rapidly bury you then hope that the earth move in such a way as to bring the bone back up to the surface and then you hope that one of we lot will walk around and find small piece of you laughter ok so it be absolutely surprising that we know as much as we do know today about we ancestor because it be incredibly difficult a for this thing to become to be preserve and secondly for they to have be bring back up to the surface and we really have only spend 50 year look for this remains and begin to actually piece together we evolutionary story so let go to Lake Turkana which be one such lake basin in the very north of we country Kenya and if you look north here there be a big river that flow into the lake that be be carry sediment and preserve the remains of the animal that live there Fossil site run up and down both length of that lake basin which represent some 20 000 square mile that be a huge job that we have get on we hand two million year ago at Lake Turkana Homo erectus one of we human ancestor actually live in this region you can see some of the major fossil site that we have be work in the north but essentially two million year ago Homo erectus up in the far right corner live alongside three other species of human ancestor and here be a skull of a Homo erectus which I just pull off the shelf there laughter but it be not to say that be a single species on planet earth be the norm in fact if you go back in time it be the norm that there be multiple species of hominid or of human ancestor that coexist at any one time where do this thing come from that be what we be still try to find answer to and it be important to realize that there be diversity in all different species and we ancestor be no exception here be some reconstruction of some of the fossil that have be find from Lake Turkana but I be very lucky to have be bring up in Kenya essentially accompany my parent to Lake Turkana in search of human remain and we be able to dig up when we get old enough fossil such as this a slender snout crocodile and we dig up giant tortoise and elephant and thing like that but when I be 12 as I be in this picture a very exciting expedition be in place on the west side when they find essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus I could relate to this homo erectus skeleton very well because I be the same age that he be when he die and I imagine he to be tall dark skinned he brother certainly be able to run long distance chase prey probably sweat heavily as they do so he be very able to use stone effectively as tool and this individual himself this one that I be hold up here actually have a bad back he have probably have a injury as a child he have a scoliosis and therefore must have be look after quite carefully by other female and probably much small member of he family group to have get to where he do in life age 12 unfortunately for he he fall into a swamp and could not get out essentially he bone be rapidly bury and beautifully preserve and he remain there until 1 6 million year later when this very famous fossil hunter Kamoya Kimeu walk along a small hillside and find that small piece of he skull lie on the surface amongst the pebble recognize it as be hominid it be actually this little piece up here on the top well a excavation be begin immediately and more and more little bit of skull start to be extract from the sediment and what be so fun about it be this the skull piece get close and close to the root of the tree and fairly recently the tree have grow up but it have find that the skull have capture nice water in the hillside and so it have decide to grow its root in and around this hold it in place and prevent it from wash away down the slope we begin to find limb bone we find finger bone the bone of the pelvis vertebra rib the collar bone thing that have never ever be see before in Homo erectus it be truly exciting he have a body very similar to we own and he be on the threshold of become human well shortly afterwards member of he species start to move northwards out of Africa and you start to see fossil of Homo erectus in Georgia China and also in part of Indonesia so Homo erectus be the first human ancestor to leave Africa and begin its spread across the globe some exciting find again as I mention from Dmanisi in the Republic of Georgia but also surprising find recently announce from the island of Flores in Indonesia where a group of this human ancestor have be isolate and have become dwarf and they be only about a meter in height but they live only 18 000 year ago and that be truly extraordinary to think about just to put this in term of generation because person do find it hard to think of time homo erectus leave Africa 90 000 generation ago we evolve essentially from a African stock again at about 200 000 year as a fully fledged we and we only leave Africa about 70 000 year ago and until 30 000 year ago at least three upright walking ape share the planet Earth the question now be well who be we we be certainly a pollute wasteful aggressive species with a few nice thing throw in perhaps laughter for the most part we be not particularly pleasant at all we have a much large brain than we ape ancestor be this a good evolutionary adaptation or be it go to lead we to be the short live hominid species on planet Earth and what be it that really make we we I think it be we collective intelligence it be we ability to write thing down we language and we consciousness from very primitive beginning with a very crude tool kit of stone we now have a very advanced tool kit and we tool use have really reach unprecedented level we have get buggy to Mars we have map the human genome and recently even create synthetic life thanks to Craig Venter and we have also manage to communicate with person all over the world from extraordinary place even from within a excavation in northern Kenya we can talk to person about what we be do as Al Gore so clearly have remind we we have reach extraordinary number of person on this planet human ancestor really only survive on planet earth if you look at the fossil record for about on average a million year at a time we have only be around for the past 200 000 year as a species yet we have reach a population of more than six and a half billion person and last year we population grow by 80 million I mean this be extraordinary number you can see here again take from Al Gore book but what be happen be we technology have remove the check and balance on we population growth we have to control we number and I think this be as important as anything else that be be do in the world today but we have to control we number because we can not really hold it together as a species my father so appropriately put it that we be certainly the only animal that make conscious choice that be bad for we survival as a species can we hold it together it be important to remember that we all evolve in Africa we all have a African origin we have a common past and we share a common future evolutionarily speak we be just a blip we be sit on the edge of a precipice and we have the tool and the technology at we hand to communicate what need to be do to hold it together today we could tell every single human be out there if we really want to but will we do that or will we just let nature take its course well to end on a very positive note I think evolutionarily speak this be probably a fairly good thing in the end I will leave it at that thank you very much applause
