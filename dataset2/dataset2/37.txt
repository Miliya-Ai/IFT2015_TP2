I want to start off by say Houston we have a problem we be enter a second generation of no progress in term of human flight in space in fact we have regress we stand a very big chance of lose we ability to inspire we youth to go out and continue this very important thing that we as a species have always do and that be instinctively we have go out and climb over difficult place go to more hostile place and find out later maybe to we surprise that that be the reason we survive and I feel very strongly that it be not good enough for we to have generation of kid that think that it be ok to look forward to a good version of a cell phone with a video in it they need to look forward to exploration they need to look forward to colonization they need to look forward to breakthrough we need to inspire they because they need to lead we and help we survive in the future I be particularly trouble that what NASA do right now with this new Bush doctrine to for this next decade and a half oh shoot I screw up we have real specific instruction here not to talk about politics laughter what we be look forward to be applause what we be look forward to be not only the inspiration of we child but the current plan right now be not really even allow the most creative person in this country the Boeing and Lockheed space engineer to go out and take risk and try new stuff we be go to go back to the moon 50 year later and we be go to do it very specifically plan to not learn anything new I be really trouble by that but anyway that be the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today though be that right back to where we inspire person who will be we great leader later that be the theme of my next 15 minute here and I think that the inspiration begin when you be very young three year old up to 12 14 year old what they look at be the most important thing let take a snapshot at aviation and there be a wonderful little short four year time period when marvelous thing happen it start in 1908 when the Wright brother fly in Paris and everybody say Ooh hey I can do that there be only a few person that have fly in early 1908 in four year 39 country have hundred of airplane thousand of pilot Airplanes be invent by natural selection now you can say that intelligent design design we airplane of today but there be no intelligent design really design that early airplane there be probably at least 30 000 different thing try and when they crash and kill the pilot do not try that again the one that fly and land ok because there be no train pilot who have good fly quality by definition so we by make a whole bunch of attempt thousand of attempt in that four year time period we invent the concept of the airplane that we fly today and that be why they be so safe as we give it a lot of chance to find what be good that have not happen at all in space fly there be only be two concept try two by the U S and one by the Russian well who be inspire during that time period Aviation Week ask I to make a list of who I think be the mover and shaker of the first 100 year of aviation and I write they down and I find out later that every one of they be a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation well what happen when I be a little kid be some pretty heavy stuff too the jet age start the missile age start Von Braun be on there show how to go to Mars and this be before Sputnik and this be at a time when Mars be a hell of a lot more interesting than it be now we think there would be animal there we know there be plant there the color change right but you know NASA screw that up because they have send this robot and they have land it only in the desert laughter if you look at what happen this little black line be as fast as man ever fly and the red line be top of the line military fighter and the blue line be commercial air transport you notice here be a big jump when I be a little kid and I think that have something to do with give I the courage to go out and try something that other person be not have the courage to try well what do I do when I be a kid I do not do the hotrod and the girl and the dancing and well we do not have drug in that day but I do competition model airplane I spend about seven year during the Vietnam War flight testing airplane for the Air Force and then I go in and I have a lot of fun building airplane that person could build in they garage and some 3 000 of that be fly of course one of they be around the world Voyager I found another company in 82 which be my company now and we have develop more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982 and there be a lot of they that I actually can not show you on this chart the most impressive airplane ever I believe be design only a dozen year after the first operational jet stay in service till it be too rusty to fly take out of service we retreat in 98 back to something that be develop in 56 what the most impressive spaceship ever I believe be a Grumman Lunar Lander it be a you know it land on the moon take off of the moon do not need any maintenance guy that kind of cool we have lose that capability we abandon it in 72 this thing be design three year after Gagarin first fly in space in 1961 three year and we can not do that now Crazy Talk very briefly about innovation cycle thing that grow have a lot of activity they die out when they be replace by something else this thing tend to happen every 25 year 40 year long with a overlap you can put that statement on all kind of different technology the interesting thing by the way the speed here excuse I high speed travel be the title of this innovation cycle there be none here this two new airplane be the same speed as the DC8 that be do in 1958 here be the biggie and that be you do not have innovation cycle if the government develop and the government use it you know a good example of course be the DARPA net computer be use for artillery first then IRS but when we get it now you have all the level of activity all the benefit from it private sector have to do it keep that in mind I put down innovation I have look for innovation cycle in space I find none the very first year start when Gagarin go in space and a few week later Alan Shepherd there be five manned space flight in the world the very first year in 2003 everyone that the United States send to space be kill there be only three or four flight in 2003 in 2004 there be only two flight two Russian Soyuz flight to the international manned station and I have to fly three in Mojave with my little group of a couple dozen person in order to get to a total of five which be the number the same year back in 1961 there be no growth there be no activity there be no nothing this be a picture here take from SpaceShipOne this be a picture here take from orbit we goal be to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that we know how to do it for sub orbital fly now do it safe enough at least as safe as the early airline so that can be do and I think I want to talk a little bit about why we have the courage to go out and try that as a small company well first of all what be go to happen next the first industry will be a high volume a lot of player there be another one announce just last week and it will be sub orbital and the reason it have to be sub orbital be there be not solution for adequate safety to fly the public to orbit the government have be do this three government have be do this for 45 year and still four percent of the person that have leave the atmosphere have die that be you do not want to run a business with that kind of a safety record it will be very high volume we think 100 000 person will fly by 2020 I can not tell you when this will start because I do not want my competition to know my schedule but I think once it do we will find solution and very quickly you will see that resort hotel in orbit and that real easy thing to do which be a swing around the moon so you have this cool view and that will be really cool because the moon do not have a atmosphere you can do a elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 foot if you want oh it be go to be so much fun laughter ok my critic say hey Rutan be just spend a lot of this billionaire money for joyride for billionaire what be this this be not a transportation system it be just for fun and I use to be bother by that and then I get to think well wait a minute I buy my first Apple computer in 1978 and I buy it because I could say I get a computer at my house and you do not what do you use it for come over it do Frogger ok laughter not the bank computer or Lockheed computer but the home computer be for game for a whole decade it be for fun we do not even know what it be for but what happen the fact that we have this big industry big development big improvement and capability and so on and they get out there in enough home we be ripe for a new invention and the inventor be in this audience Al Gore invent the internet and because of that something that we use for a whole year excuse I a whole decade for fun become everything we commerce we research we communication and if we let the Google guy think for another couple weekend we can add a dozen more thing to the list laughter and it will not be very long before you will not be able to convince kid that we do not always have computer in we home so fun be defendable ok I want to show you kind of a busy chart but in it be my prediction with what be go to happen and in it also bring up another point right here there be a group of person that have come forward and you do not know all of they but the one that have come forward be inspire as young child this little three to 15 year old age by we go to orbit and go to the moon here right in this time period Paul Allen Elan musk Richard Branson Jeff Bezos the Ansari family which be now fund the Russian sub orbital thing Bob Bigelow a private space station and Carmack this person be take money and put it in a interesting area and I think it be a lot good than they put it in a area of a good cell phone or something but they be put it in very area and this will lead we into this kind of capability and it will lead we into the next really big thing and it will allow we to explore and I think eventually it will allow we to colonize and to keep we from go extinct they be inspire by big progress but look at the progress that be go on after that there be a couple of example here the military fighter have a high performance military airplane be the sr71 it go a whole life cycle get too rusty to fly and be take out of service the Concorde double the speed for airline travel it go a whole life cycle without competition take out of service and we be stick back here with the same kind of capability for military fighter and commercial airline travel that we have back in the late 50 but something be out there to inspire we kid now and I be talk about if you have get a baby now or if you have get a 10 year old now what be out there be there be something really interesting go to happen here relatively soon you will be able to buy a ticket and fly high and fast than the high performance military operational airplane it be never happen before the fact that they have stick here with this kind of performance have be well you know you win the war in 12 minute why do you need something good but I think when you guy start buy ticket and fly sub orbital flight to space very soon wait a minute what be happen here we will have military fighter with sub orbital capability and I think very soon this but the interesting thing about it be the commercial guy be go to go first ok I look forward to a new capitalist space race let call it you remember the space race in the 60 be for national prestige because we lose the first two milestone we do not lose they technically the fact that we have the hardware to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it you can argue that be not a technical loss Sputnik be not a technical loss but it be a prestige loss America the world see America as not be the leader in technology and that be a very strong thing and then we fly Alan Shepherd week after Gagarin not month or decade or whatever so we have the capability but America lose we lose and because of that we make a big jump to recover it well again what be interesting here be we have lose to the Russian on the first couple of milestone already you can not buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America can not do it you can buy it in Russia you can fly with Russian hardware this be available because a Russian space program be starve and it be nice for they to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seat it be commercial it can be define as space tourism they be also offer a trip to go on this whip around the moon like Apollo 8 be do 100 million buck hey I can go to the moon but you know would you have think back in the 60 when the space race be go on that the first commercial capitalist like thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware and would you have think would the Russian have think that when they first go to the moon in they develop hardware the guy inside will not be Russian maybe it will probably be a Japanese or a American billionaire well that be weird you know it really be but anyway I think we need to beat they again I think what we will do be we will see a successful very successful private space flight industry whether we be first or not really do not matter the Russian actually fly a supersonic transport before the Concorde and then they fly a few cargo flight and take it out of service I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff be offer ok we will talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight this little thing say here five time what NASA do by 2020 I want to tell you already there be about 1 5 billion to 1 7 billion investment in private space flight that be not government at all already worldwide if you read if you Google it you will find about half of that money but there be twice of that be commit out there not spend yet but be commit and plan for the next few year hey that be pretty big I be predict though as profitable as this industry be go to be and it certainly be profitable when you fly person at 200 000 dollar on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost or less this be go to be very profitable I predict also that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the U S taxpayer spend for NASA manned spacecraft work and every dollar that flow into that will be spend more efficiently by a factor of 10 to 15 and what that mean be before we know it the progress in human space flight with no taxpayer dollar will be at a level of about five time as much as the current NASA budget for human space flight and that be because it be we it be private industry you should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff and we have do it for a long time the NACA before NASA never develop a airliner and never run a airline but NASA be develop the space liner always have and run the only space line ok and we have shy away from it because we be afraid of it but start back in June of 2004 when I show that a little group out there actually can do it can get a start with it everything change after that time ok thank you very much applause
