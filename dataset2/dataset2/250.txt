how do group get anything do right how do you organize a group of individual so that the output of the group be something coherent and of last value instead of just be chaos and the economic framing of that problem be call coordination cost and a coordination cost be essentially all of the financial or institutional difficulty in arrange group output and we have have a classic answer for coordination cost which be if you want to coordinate the work of a group of person you start a institution right you raise some resource you find something it can be private or public it can be for profit or not profit it can be large or small but you get this resource together you find a institution and you use the institution to coordinate the activity of the group more recently because the cost of let group communicate with each other have fall through the floor and communication cost be one of the big input to coordination there have be a second answer which be to put the cooperation into the infrastructure to design system that coordinate the output of the group as a by product of the operating of the system without regard to institutional model so that be what I want to talk about today I be go to illustrate it with some fairly concrete example but always point to the broad theme so I be go to start by try to answer a question that I know each of you will have ask yourself at some point or other and which the internet be purpose build to answer which be where can I get a picture of a roller skate mermaid so in New York City on the first Saturday of every summer Coney Island we local charmingly run down amusement park host the Mermaid Parade it be a amateur parade person come from all over the city person get all dress up some person get less dress up Young and old dancing in the street colorful character and a good time be have by all and what I want to call you attention to be not the Mermaid Parade itself charming though it be but rather to this photo I do not take they how do I get they and the answer be I get they from Flickr Flickr be a photo sharing service that allow person to take photo upload they share they over the web and so forth recently Flickr have add a additional function call tagging tag be pioneer by Delicious and Joshua Schachter Delicious be a social bookmarking service tagging be a cooperative infrastructure answer to classification right if I have give this talk last year I could not do what I just do because I could not have find that photo but instead of say we need to hire a professional class of librarian to organize this photo once they be upload Flickr simply turn over to the user the ability to characterize the photo so I be able to go in and draw down photo that have be tag Mermaid Parade there be 3 100 photo take by 118 photographer all aggregate and then put under this nice neat name show in reverse chronological order and I be then able to go and retrieve they to give you that little slideshow now what hard problem be be solve here and it be in the most schematic possible view it be a coordination problem right there be a large number of person on the internet a very small fraction of they have photo of the Mermaid Parade how do we get that person together to contribute that work the classic answer be to form a institution right to draw that person into some prearrange structure that have explicit goal and I want to call you attention to some of the side effect of go the institutional route First of all when you form a institution you take on a management problem right no good just hire employee you also have to hire other employee to manage that employee and to enforce the goal of the institution and so forth secondly you have to bring structure into place right you have to have economic structure you have to have legal structure you have to have physical structure and that create additional cost third form a institution be inherently exclusionary you notice we have not get everybody who have a photo you can not hire everyone in a company right you can not recruit everyone into a governmental organization you have to exclude some person and fourth as a result of that exclusion you end up with a professional class look at the change here we have go from person with photo to photographer right we have create a professional class of photographer whose goal be to go out and photograph the Mermaid Parade or whatever else they be send out to photograph when you build cooperation into the infrastructure which be the Flickr answer you can leave the person where they be and you take the problem to the individual rather than move the individual to the problem you arrange the coordination in the group and by do that you get the same outcome without the institutional difficulty you lose the institutional imperative you lose the right to shape person work when it be volunteer effort but you also shed the institutional cost which give you great flexibility what Flickr do be it replace plan with coordination and this be a general aspect of this cooperative system right you will have experience this in you life whenever you buy you first mobile phone and you stop make plan you just say I will call you when I get there call I when you get off work right that be a point to point replacement of coordination with planning right we be now able to do that kind of thing with group to say instead of we must make a advance plan we must have a five year projection of where the Wikipedia be go to be or whatever you can just say let coordinate the group effort and let deal with it as we go because we be now well enough coordinate that we do not have to take on the problem of decide in advance what to do so here be another example this one somewhat more somber this be photo on Flickr tag Iraq and everything that be hard about the coordination cost with the Mermaid Parade be even hard here there be more picture there be more photographer it be take over a wide geographic area the photo be spread out over a long period of time and bad of all that figure at the bottom approximately ten photo per photographer be a lie it be mathematically true but it do not really talk about anything important because in this system the average be not really what matter what matter be this this be a graph of photograph tag Iraq as take by the 529 photographer who contribute the 5 445 photo and it be rank in order of number of photo take per photographer you can see here over at the end we most prolific photographer have take around 350 photo and you can see there be a few person who have take hundred of photo then there be dozen of person who have take dozen of photo and by the time we get around here we get ten or few photo and then there be this long flat tail and by the time you get to the middle you have get hundred of person who have contribute only one photo each this be call a power law distribution it appear often in unconstrained social system where person be allow to contribute as much or as little as they like this be often what you get right the math behind the power law distribution be that whatever be in the nth position be do about one nth of whatever be be measure relative to the person in the first position so we would expect the tenth most prolific photographer to have contribute about a tenth of the photo and the hundredth most prolific photographer to have contribute only about a hundred as many photo as the most prolific photographer do so the head of the curve can be sharp or flat but that basic math account both for the steep slope and for the long flat tail and curiously in this system as they grow large the system do not converge they diverge more in big system the head get big and the tail get long so the imbalance increase you can see the curve be obviously heavily left weight here be how heavily if you take the top 10 percent of photographer contribute to this system they account for three quarter of the photo take just the top 10 percent most prolific photographer if you go down to five percent you be still account for 60 percent of the photo if you go down to one percent exclude 99 percent of the group effort you be still account for almost a quarter of the photo and because of this left weighting the average be actually here way to the left and that sound strange to we ear but what end up happen be that 80 percent of the contributor have contribute a below average amount that sound strange because we expect average and middle to be about the same but they be not at all this be the math underlie the 80 20 rule right whenever you hear anybody talk about the 80 20 rule this be what be go on right 20 percent of the merchandise account for 80 percent of the revenue 20 percent of the user use 80 percent of the resource this be the shape person be talk about when that happen institution only have two tool carrot and stick and the 80 percent zone be a no carrot and no stick zone the cost of run the institution mean that you can not take on the work of that person easily in a institutional frame the institutional model always push leftward treat this person as employee the institutional response be I can get 75 percent of the value for 10 percent of the hire great that be what I will do the cooperative infrastructure model say why do you want to give up a quarter of the value if you system be design so that you have to give up a quarter of the value re engineer the system do not take on the cost that prevent you from get to the contribution of this person build the system so that anybody can contribute at any amount so the coordination response ask not how be this person as employee but rather what be they contribution like right we have over here Psycho Milt a Flickr user who have contribute one and only one photo title Iraq and here be the photo right label bad day at Work Right so the question be do you want that photo yes or no the question be not be Psycho Milt a good employee and the tension here be between institution as enabler and institution as obstacle when you be deal with the left hand edge of one of this distribution when you be deal with the person who spend a lot of time produce a lot of the material you want that be a institution as enabler world you can hire that person as employee you can coordinate they work and you can get some output but when you be down here where the Psycho Milts of the world be add one photo at a time that be institution as obstacle institution hate be tell they be obstacle one of the first thing that happen when you institutionalize a problem be that the first goal of the institution immediately shift from whatever the nominal goal be to self preservation and the actual goal of the institution go to two through n right so when institution be tell they be obstacle and that there be other way of coordinate the value they go through something a little bit like the Kubler Ross stage laughter of reaction be tell you have a fatal illness denial anger bargaining acceptance most of the cooperative system we have see have not be around long enough to have get to the acceptance phase many many institution be still in denial but we be see recently a lot of both anger and bargaining there be a wonderful small example go on right now in France a bus company be sue person for form a carpool right because the fact that they have coordinate themselves to create cooperative value be deprive they of revenue you can follow this in the Guardian it be actually quite entertaining the big question be what do you do about the value down here right how do you capture that and institution as I have say be prevent from capture that Steve Ballmer now CEO of Microsoft be criticize Linux a couple of year ago and he say oh this business of thousand of programmer contribute to Linux this be a myth we have look at who be contribute to Linux and most of the patch have be produce by programmer who have only do one thing right you can hear this distribution under that complaint and you can see why from Ballmer point of view that be a bad idea right we hire this programmer he come in he drink we Cokes and play Foosball for three year and he have one idea laughter right bad hire right laughter the Psycho Milt question be be it a good idea what if it be a security patch what if it be a security patch for a buffer overflow exploit of which Windows have not some but several do you want that patch right the fact that a single programmer can without have to move into a professional relation to a institution improve Linux once and never be see from again should terrify Ballmer because this kind of value be unreachable in classic institutional framework but be part of cooperative system of open source software of file sharing of the Wikipedia I have use a lot of example from Flickr but there be actually story about this from all over Meetup a service find so that user could find person in they local area who share they interest and affinity and actually have a real world meeting offline in a cafe or a pub or what have you when Scott Heiferman find Meetup he think it would be use for you know train spotter and cat fancy classic affinity group the inventor do not know what the invention be number one group on Meetup right now most chapter in most city with most member most active stay at home mom right in the suburbanized dual income United States stay at home mom be actually miss the social infrastructure that come from extend family and local small scale neighborhood so they be reinvent it use this tool meetup be the platform but the value here be in social infrastructure if you want to know what technology be go to change the world do not pay attention to 13 year old boy pay attention to young mother because they have get not a ounce of support for technology that do not materially make they life well this be so much more important than Xbox but it be a lot less glitzy I think this be a revolution I think that this be a really profound change in the way human affair be arrange and I use that word advisedly it be a revolution in that it be a change in equilibrium it be a whole new way of do thing which include new downside in the United States right now a woman name Judith Miller be in jail for not have give to a Federal Grand Jury she source she be a reporter for the New York Times she source in a very abstract and hard to follow case and journalist be in the street rally to improve the shield law the shield law be we law pretty much a patchwork of state law that prevent a journalist from have to betray a source this be happen however against the background of the rise of web log web log be a classic example of mass amateurization it have de professionalize publishing want to publish globally anything you think today it be a one button operation that you can do for free that have send the professional class of publish down into the rank of mass amateurization and so the shield law as much as we want it we want a professional class of truth teller it be become increasingly incoherent because the institution be become incoherent there be person in the States right now tie themselves into knot try to figure out whether or not blogger be journalist and the answer to that question be it do not matter because that be not the right question Journalism be a answer to a even more important question which be how will society be inform how will they share idea and opinion and if there be a answer to that that happen outside the professional framework of journalism it make no sense to take a professional metaphor and apply it to this distribute class so as much as we want the shield law the background the institution to which they be attach be become incoherent here be another example pro ana the pro ana group this be group of teenage girl who have take on web log bulletin board other kind of cooperative infrastructure and have use it to set up support group for remain anorexic by choice they post picture of thin model which they call thinspiration they have little slogan like Salvation through Starvation they even have Lance Armstrong style bracelet this red bracelet which signify in the small group I be try to maintain my eating disorder they trade tip like if you feel like eat something clean a toilet or the litter box the feeling will pass we be use to support group be beneficial we have a attitude that support group be inherently beneficial but it turn out that the logic of the support group be value neutral a support group be simply a small group that want to maintain a way of live in the context of a large group now when the large group be a bunch of drunk and the small group want to stay sober then we think that be a great support group but when the small group be teenage girl who want to stay anorexic by choice then we be horrified what be happen be that the normative goal of the support group that we be use to come from the institution that be frame they and not from the infrastructure once the infrastructure become generically available the logic of the support group have be reveal to be accessible to anyone include person pursue this kind of goal so there be significant downside to this change as well as upside and of course in the current environment one need allude only lightly to the work of non state actor try to influence global affair and take advantage of this this be a social map of the hijacker and they associate who perpetrate the 9 11 attack it be produce by analyze they communication pattern use a lot of this tool and doubtless the intelligence community of the world be do the same work today for the attack of last week now this be the part of the talk where I tell you what be go to come as a result of all of this but I be run out of time which be good because I do not know laughter right as with the printing press if it be really a revolution it do not take we from Point A to Point B it take we from Point a to chaos the printing press precipitate 200 year of chaos move from a world where the Catholic Church be the sort of organize political force to the Treaty of Westphalia when we finally know what the new unit be the nation state now I be not predict 200 year of chaos as a result of this 50 50 year in which loosely coordinate group be go to be give increasingly high leverage and the more that group forego traditional institutional imperative like decide in advance what be go to happen or the profit motive the more leverage they will get and institution be go to come under a increase degree of pressure and the more rigidly manage and the more they rely on information monopoly the great the pressure be go to be and that be go to happen one arena at a time one institution at a time the force be general but the result be go to be specific and so the point here be not this be wonderful or we be go to see a transition from only institution to only cooperative framework it be go to be much more complicated than that but the point be that it be go to be a massive readjustment and since we can see it in advance and know it be come my argument be essentially we might as well get good at it thank you very much applause
