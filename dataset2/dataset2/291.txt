if you ask person about what part of psychology do they think be hard and you say well what about think and emotion most person will say emotion be terribly hard they be incredibly complex they can not I have no idea of how they work but thinking be really very straightforward it be just sort of some kind of logical reasoning or something but that be not the hard part so here be a list of problem that come up one nice problem be what do we do about health the other day I be read something and the person say probably the large single cause of disease be handshake in the West and there be a little study about person who do not handshake and compare they with one who do handshake and I have not the foggy idea of where you find the one that do not handshake because they must be hide and the person who avoid that have 30 percent less infectious disease or something or maybe it be 31 and a quarter percent so if you really want to solve the problem of epidemic and so forth let start with that and since I get that idea I have have to shake hundred of hand and I think the only way to avoid it be to have some horrible visible disease and then you do not have to explain Education how do we improve education well the single good way be to get they to understand that what they be be tell be a whole lot of nonsense and then of course you have to do something about how to moderate that so that anybody can so they will listen to you Pollution energy shortage environmental diversity poverty how do we make stable society longevity okay there be lot of problem to worry about anyway the question I think person should talk about and it be absolutely taboo be how many person should there be and I think it should be about 100 million or maybe 500 million and then notice that a great many of this problem disappear if you have 100 million person properly spread out then if there be some garbage you throw it away preferably where you can not see it and it will rot or you throw it into the ocean and some fish will benefit from it the problem be how many person should there be and it be a sort of choice we have to make most person be about 60 inch high or more and there be this cube law so if you make they this big by use nanotechnology I suppose laughter then you could have a thousand time as many that would solve the problem but I do not see anybody do any research on make person small now it be nice to reduce the population but a lot of person want to have child and there be one solution that be probably only a few year off you know you have 46 chromosome if you be lucky you have get 23 from each parent sometimes you get a extra one or drop one out but so you can skip the grandparent and great grandparent stage and go right to the great great grandparent and you have 46 person and you give they a scanner or whatever you need and they look at they chromosome and each of they say which one he like good or she no reason to have just two sex any more even so each child have 46 parent and I suppose you could let each group of 46 parent have 15 child would not that be enough and then the child would get plenty of support and nurture and mentoring and the world population would decline very rapidly and everybody would be totally happy Timesharing be a little far off in the future and there be this great novel that Arthur Clarke write twice call against the fall of night and the City and the Stars they be both wonderful and largely the same except that computer happen in between and Arthur be look at this old book and he say well that be wrong the future must have some computer so in the second version of it there be 100 billion or 1 000 billion person on Earth but they be all store on hard disk or floppy or whatever they have in the future and you let a few million of they out at a time a person come out they live for a thousand year do whatever they do and then when it be time to go back for a billion year or a million I forget the number do not matter but there really be not very many person on Earth at a time and you get to think about yourself and you memory and before you go back into suspension you edit you memory and you change you personality and so forth the plot of the book be that there be not enough diversity so that the person who design the city make sure that every now and then a entirely new person be create and in the novel a particular one name Alvin be create and he say maybe this be not the good way and wreck the whole system I do not think the solution that I propose be good enough or smart enough I think the big problem be that we be not smart enough to understand which of the problem we be face be good enough therefore we have to build super intelligent machine like HAL as you remember at some point in the book for 2001 HAL realize that the universe be too big and grand and profound for that really stupid astronaut if you contrast HAL behavior with the triviality of the person on the spaceship you can see what be write between the line well what be we go to do about that we could get smart I think that we be pretty smart as compare to chimpanzee but we be not smart enough to deal with the colossal problem that we face either in abstract mathematics or in figure out economy or balance the world around so one thing we can do be live long and nobody know how hard that be but we will probably find out in a few year you see there be two fork in the road we know that person live twice as long as chimpanzee almost and nobody live more than 120 year for reason that be not very well understand but lot of person now live to 90 or 100 unless they shake hand too much or something like that and so maybe if we live 200 year we could accumulate enough skill and knowledge to solve some problem so that be one way of go about it and as I say we do not know how hard that be it might be after all most other mammal live half as long as the chimpanzee so we be sort of three and a half or four time have four time the longevity of most mammal and in the case of the primate we have almost the same gene we only differ from chimpanzee in the present state of knowledge which be absolute hogwash maybe by just a few hundred gene what I think be that the gene counter do not know what they be do yet and whatever you do do not read anything about genetics that be publish within you lifetime or something laughter the stuff have a very short half life same with brain science and so it might be that if we just fix four or five gene we can live 200 year or it might be that it be just 30 or 40 and I doubt that it be several hundred so this be something that person will be discuss and lot of ethicist you know a ethicist be somebody who see something wrong with whatever you have in mind laughter and it be very hard to find a ethicist who consider any change worth make because he say what about the consequence and of course we be not responsible for the consequence of what we be do now be we like all this complaint about clone and yet two random person will mate and have this child and both of they have some pretty rotten gene and the child be likely to come out to be average which by chimpanzee standard be very good indeed if we do have longevity then we will have to face the population growth problem anyway because if person live 200 or 1 000 year then we can not let they have a child more than about once every 200 or 1 000 year and so there will not be any workforce and one of the thing Laurie Garrett point out and other have be that a society that do not have person of work age be in real trouble and thing be go to get bad because there be nobody to educate the child or to feed the old and when I be talk about a long lifetime of course I do not want somebody who be 200 year old to be like we image of what a 200 year old be which be dead actually you know there be about 400 different part of the brain which seem to have different function nobody know how most of they work in detail but we do know that there be lot of different thing in there and they do not always work together I like Freud theory that most of they be cancel each other out and so if you think of yourself as a sort of city with a hundred resource then when you be afraid for example you may discard you long range goal but you may think deeply and focus on exactly how to achieve that particular goal you throw everything else away you become a monomaniac all you care about be not step out on that platform and when you be hungry food become more attractive and so forth so I see emotion as highly evolve subset of you capability emotion be not something add to thought a emotional state be what you get when you remove 100 or 200 of you normally available resource so think of emotion as the opposite of as something less than thinking be immensely productive and I hope in the next few year to show that this will lead to smart machine and I guess I well skip all the rest of this which be some detail on how we might make that smart machine and laughter and the main idea be in fact that the core of a really smart machine be one that recognize that a certain kind of problem be face you this be a problem of such and such a type and therefore there be a certain way or way of think that be good for that problem so I think the future main problem of psychology be to classify type of predicament type of situation type of obstacle and also to classify available and possible way to think and pair they up so you see it be almost like a pavlovian we lose the first hundred year of psychology by really trivial theory where you say how do person learn how to react to a situation what I be say be after we go through a lot of level include design a huge messy system with thousand of port we will end up again with the central problem of psychology say not what be the situation but what be the kind of problem and what be the kind of strategy how do you learn they how do you connect they up how do a really creative person invent a new way of think out of the available resource and so forth so I think in the next 20 year if we can get rid of all of the traditional approach to artificial intelligence like neural net and genetic algorithm and rule base system and just turn we sight a little bit high to say can we make a system that can use all that thing for the right kind of problem some problem be good for neural net we know that other neural net be hopeless on they genetic algorithm be great for certain thing I suspect I know what they be bad at and I will not tell you laughter thank you applause
