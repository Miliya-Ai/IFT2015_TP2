I think the future of this planet depend on human not technology and we already have the knowledge we be kind of at the endgame with knowledge but we be nowhere near the endgame when it come to we perception we still have one foot in the dark age and when you listen to some of the presentation here and the extraordinary range of human capability we understanding and then you contrast it with the fact we still call this planet Earth it pretty extraordinary we have one foot in the dark age just quickly Aristotle he thing be it not flat stupid it round Galileo he have the Inquisition so he have to be a little bit more polite he be it not in the middle you know and hawke it not earth stupid it ocean this be a ocean planet t s Eliot really say it for I and this should give you goose bump we shall not cease from exploration and the end of we explore shall be to return where we start and know the place for the first time and the next line be through the unknown remembered gate where the last of earth discover be that which be the begin so I have one message it seem to I that we be all point in the wrong direction for the rocketeer in the audience I love what you be do I admire the gut I admire the courage but you rocket be point in the wrong goddamn direction laughter and it all a question of perspective let I try and tell you I do not mean to insult you but look if I and I be not do this for real because it would be a insult so I be go to pretend and it soften the blow I be go to tell you what you be think if I hold up a square that be one foot square and the color of earth and I hold up another square that be the root two square so it 1 5 time big and be the color of the ocean and I say what be the relative value of this two thing well it the relative importance you would say yeah yeah yeah we all know this water cover twice the area of the planet than dry land but it a question of perception and if that what you be think if that what you think I mean when I say this be a ocean planet stupidly call Earth if you think that that the relative importance two to one you re wrong by a factor of ten now you be not as thick as two short plank but you sound like it when you say Earth because that demonstration if I turn around this way that earth plane would be as thin as paper it a thin film two dimensional existence the ocean representation would have a depth to it and if you heft that two thing you might find that the relative scale of that be 20 to 1 it turn out that something more than 94 percent of life on earth be aquatic that mean that we terrestrial occupy a minority the problem we have in believe that be you just have to give up this notion that this Earth be create for we because it a problem we have if this be a ocean planet and we only have a small minority of this planet it just interfere with a lot of what humanity think okay let I criticize this thing I be not talk about James Cameron although I could but I will not you really do have to go and see he late film alien of the deep it incredible it feature two of this deep rover and I can criticize they because this sweet thing be mine this I think represent one of the most beautiful classic submersible build if you look at that sub you will see a sphere this be a acryclic sphere it generate all of the buoyancy all of the payload for the craft and the battery be down here hang underneath exactly like a balloon this be the envelope and this be the gondola the payload also come up later for criticism be this massive light and this one actually carry two great manipulator it actually be a very good work sub that what it be design for the problem with it be and the reason I will never build another one like it be that this be a product of two dimensional think it what we human do when we go in the ocean as engineer we take all we terrestrial hang up all we constraint importantly this two dimensional constraint that we have and they be so constrained we do not even understand it and we take they underwater you notice that Jim Cameron be sit in a seat a seat work in a two dimensional world where gravity blast down on that seat ok and in a two dimensional world we do know about the third dimension but we do not use it because to go up require a awful lot of energy against gravity and then we mother tell we careful you do not fall down because you will fall over now go into the real atmosphere of this planet this planet have a inner atmosphere of water it its inner atmosphere it have two atmosphere a less outer gaseous atmosphere a light one most of life on earth be in that inner atmosphere and that life enjoy a three dimensional existence which be alien to we Fish do not sit in seat laughter they do not they mother do not say to little baby fish careful you do not fall over they do not fall over they do not fall they live in a three dimensional world where there be no difference in energy between go this way that way that way or that way it truly a three dimensional space and we be only just begin to grasp it I do not know of any other submersible or even remote that just take advantage that this be a three dimensional space this be the way we should be go into the ocean this be a three dimensional machine what we need to do be go down into the ocean with the freedom of the animal and move in this three dimensional space ok this be good stuff this be man first attempt at fly underwater right now I be just come down on this gorgeous big giant manta ray she have twice the wingspan that I do there I be come she see I and just notice how she roll under and turn she do not sit there and try and blow air into a tank and kind of flow up or sink down she just roll and the craft that I be in this have not be show before Chris ask we to show stuff that have not be show before I want you to notice that she actually turn to come back up there I be I see she come back come up underneath I I put reverse thrust and I try and pull gently down I be try to do everything very gently we spend about three hour together and she beginning to trust I and this ballet be control by this lady here she get about that close and then she pull away so now I try and go after she but I be practice fly this be the first fly machine this be the first prototype this be a fly by wire it have wing there be no silly buoyancy tank it permanently positively buoyant and then by move through the water it able to take that control now look at that look it she just blow I away she just roll right away from underneath really that the only real dive I have ever make in this machine it take 10 year to build but this lady here teach I hah teach I so much we just learn so much in three hour in the water there I just have to go and build another machine but look here instead of blow tank and come up slowly without think about it it a little bit of back pressure and that sub just come straight back up out of the water this be a internal Sony camera thank you Sony I do not really look that ugly but the camera be so close that it just distort now there she go right overhead this be a wide angle camera she just a few inch off the top of my head Aah ha oh he just cross over the top of my head about oh I do not know just so close I come back up not for air this be a incredible encounter with a manta I be speechless we have be just foot apart I be go back down now okay can we cut that light back up please applause try to fly and keep up with that animal it be not the lack of maneuverability that we have it be the fact she be go so slow I actually design that to move fast through the water because I think that be the thing that we need to do to move fast and get range but after that encounter I really do want to go back with that animal and dance she want to dance and so what we need to do be increase the wing area so that we just have more grip develop high force so the sub that be outside last year this be the one you see the large wing area here also clearly it be such a powerful thing we want to try and bring other person but we could not figure out how to do it so we open the world first flight school the rational for the world first flight school go something like when the coastguard come up to I and say they use to leave we alone when we be diving this goofy little spherical thing but when we start fly around in underwater jet fighter they get a little nervous they would come up and say do you have a license for that and then I would put my sunglass on the beard that would all sprout out and I would say I do not need no stink license laughter I write this stink license which I do so Bob Gelfond around here but somebody in the audience here have license number 20 they be one of the first subsea aviator so we have run two flight school where the hell that go I do not know but it a lot of fun what come next in 30 second I can not tell you but the patent for underwater flight Karen and I we be look at it some business partner want we to patent it we be not sure about that we have decide we be just go to let that go it just seem wrong to try and patent applause the freedom for underwater flight so anybody who want to copy we and come and join we go for it the other thing be that we have get much low cost we develop some other technology call spider optics and Craig Ventner ask I to make a announcement here this morning we be go to be build a beautiful little small version of this unmanned super deep for he boat to go and get back some deep sea dna stuff applause thank you
