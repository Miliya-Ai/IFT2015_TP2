so indeed I have spend my life look into the life of president who be no long alive wake up with Abraham Lincoln in the morning thinking of Franklin Roosevelt when I go to bed at night but when I try and think about what I have learn about the meaning in life my mind keep wander back to a seminar that I take when I be a graduate student at Harvard with the great psychologist Erik Erikson he teach we that the rich and ful life attempt to achieve a inner balance between three realm work love and play and that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the other be to open oneself to ultimate sadness in old age whereas to pursue all three with equal dedication be to make possible a life fill not only with achievement but with serenity so since I tell story let I look back on the life of two of the president I have study to illustrate this point Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson as for that first sphere of work I think what Abraham Lincoln life suggest be that fierce ambition be a good thing he have a huge ambition but it be not simply for office or power or celebrity or fame what it be for be to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little good place for he have live in it even as a child it seem Lincoln dream heroic dream he somehow have to escape that hard scrabble farm from which he be bear no schooling be possible for he except a few week here a few week there but he read book in every spare moment he could find it be say when he get a copy of the King James Bible or Aesop Fables he be so excited he could not sleep he could not eat the great poet Emily Dickinson once say there be no frigate like a book to take we land away how true for Lincoln though he never would travel to Europe he go with Shakespeare king to merry England he go with Lord Byron poetry to Spain and Portugal Literature allow he to transcend he surroundings but there be so many loss in he early life that he be haunt by death he mother die when he be only nine year old he only sister Sarah in childbirth a few year later and he first love Ann Rutledge at the age of 22 moreover when he mother lay die she do not hold out for he the hope that they would meet in a afterworld she simply say to he Abraham I be go away from you now and I shall never return as a result he become obsessed with the thought that when we die we life be sweep away dust to dust but only as he grow old do he develop a certain consolation from a ancient Greek notion but follow by other culture as well that if you could accomplish something worthy in you life you could live on in the memory of other you honor and you reputation would outlive you earthly existence and that worthy ambition become he lodestar it carry he through the one significant depression that he suffer when he be in he early 30 three thing have combine to lay he low he have break he engagement with Mary Todd not certain he be ready to marry she but know how devastating it be to she that he do that he one intimate friend Joshua Speed be leave Illinois to go back to Kentucky because Speed father have die and he political career in the state legislature be on a downward slide he be so depressed that friend worry he be suicidal they take all knife and razor and scissors from he room and he great friend speed go to he side and say Lincoln you must rally or you will die he say that I would just as soon die right now but I have not yet do anything to make any human being remember that I have live so fuel by that ambition he return to the state legislature he eventually win a seat in Congress he then run twice for the Senate lose twice everyone be break by life Ernest Hemingway once say but some person be strong in the broken place so then he surprise the nation with a upset victory for the presidency over three far more experienced far more educated far more celebrated rival and then when he win the general election he stun the nation even more by appoint each of this three rival into he Cabinet it be a unprecedented act at the time because everybody think he will look like a figurehead compare to this person they say why be you do this Lincoln he say look this be the strong and most able man in the country the country be in peril I need they by my side but perhaps my old friend Lyndon Johnson might have put it in less noble fashion well to have you enemy inside the tent piss out than outside the tent piss in laughter but it soon become clear that Abraham Lincoln would emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team for each of they soon come to understand that he possess a unparalleled array of emotional strength and political skill that prove far more important than the thinness of he external r sum for one thing he possess a uncanny ability to empathize with and to think about other people point of view he repair injured feeling that might have escalate into permanent hostility he share credit with ease assume responsibility for the failure of he subordinate constantly acknowledge he error and learn from he mistake this be the quality we should be look for in we candidate in 2008 applause he refuse to be provoke by petty grievance he never submit to jealousy or brood over perceive slight and he express he unshakeable conviction in everyday language in metaphor in story and with a beauty of language almost as if the Shakespeare and the poetry he have so love as a child have work they way into he very soul in 1863 when the Emancipation Proclamation be sign he bring he old friend Joshua Speed back to the White House and remember that conversation of decade before when he be so sad and he point to the Proclamation say I believe in this measure my fond hope will be realize but as he be about to put he signature on the Proclamation he own hand be numb and shake because he have shake a thousand hand that morning at a New Year reception so he put the pen down he say if ever my soul be in a act it be in this act but if I sign with a shake hand posterity will say he hesitate so he wait until he could take up the pen and sign with a bold and clear hand but even in he wildest dream Lincoln could never have imagine how far he reputation would reach I be so thrilled to find a interview with the great Russian writer Leo Tolstoy in a New York newspaper in the early 1900 and in it Tolstoy tell of a trip that he have recently make to a very remote area of the Caucasus where there be only wild barbarian who have never leave this part of Russia know that Tolstoy be in they midst they ask he to tell story of the great man of history so he say I tell they about Napoleon and Alexander the Great and Frederick the Great and Julius Caesar and they love it but before I finish the chief of the barbarian stand up and say but wait you have not tell we about the great ruler of they all we want to hear about that man who speak with a voice of thunder who laugh like the sunrise who come from that place call America which be so far from here that if a young man should travel there he would be a old man when he arrive tell we of that man tell we of Abraham Lincoln he be stunned he tell they everything he could about Lincoln and then in the interview he say what make Lincoln so great not as great a general as Napoleon not as great a statesman as Frederick the Great but he greatness consist and historian would roundly agree in the integrity of he character and the moral fiber of he be so in the end that powerful ambition that have carry Lincoln through he bleak childhood have be realize that ambition that have allow he to laboriously educate himself by himself to go through that string of political failure and the dark day of the war he story would be tell so as for that second sphere not of work but of love encompass family friend and colleague it too take work and commitment the Lyndon Johnson that I see in the last year of he life when I help he on he memoirs be a man who have spend so many year in the pursuit of work power and individual success that he have absolutely no psychic or emotional resource leave to get he through the day once the presidency be go my relationship with he begin on a rather curious level I be select as a White House Fellow when I be 24 year old we have a big dance at the White House President Johnson do dance with I that night not that peculiar there be only three woman out of the 16 White House Fellows but he do whisper in my ear that he want I to work directly for he in the White House but it be not to be that simple for in the month lead up to my selection like many young person I have be active in the anti Vietnam War movement and have write a article against Lyndon Johnson which unfortunately come out in the New Republic two day after the dance in the White House Laugher and the theme of the article be how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power laughter so I be certain he would kick I out of the program but instead surprisingly he say oh bring she down here for a year and if I can not win she over no one can so I do end up work for he in the White House eventually accompany he to he ranch to help he on that memoirs never fully understand why he have choose I to spend so many hour with I like to believe it be because I be a good listener he be a great storyteller Fabulous colorful anecdotal story there be a problem with this story however which I later discover which be that half of they be not true but they be great nonetheless laughter so I think that part of he attraction for I be that I love listen to he tall tale but I also worry that part of it be that I be then a young woman and he have somewhat of a minor league womanize reputation so I constantly chat to he about boyfriend even when I do not have any at all everything be work perfectly until one day he say he want to discuss we relationship sound very ominous when he take I nearby to the lake conveniently call Lake Lyndon Baines Johnson and there be wine and cheese and a red check tablecloth all the romantic trappings and he start out Doris more than any other woman I have ever know and my heart sink and then he say you remind I of my mother laughter it be pretty embarrassing give what be go on in my mind but I must say the old I have get the more I realize what a incredible privilege it be to have spend so many hour with this aging lion of a man a victor in a thousand contest three great civil right law Medicare aid to education and yet roundly defeat in the end by the war in Vietnam and because he be so sad and so vulnerable he open up to I in way he never would have have I know he at the height of he power share he fear he sorrow and he worry and I would like to believe that the privilege fire within I the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure that I have try to bring to each of my book since then but it also bring home to I the lesson which Erik Erikson have try to instill in all of we about the importance of find balance in life for on the surface Lyndon Johnson should have have everything in the world to feel good about in that last year in the sense that he have be elect to the presidency he have all the money he need to pursue any leisure activity he want he own a spacious ranch in the countryside a penthouse in the city sailboat speedboat he have servant to answer any whim and he have a family who love he deeply and yet year of concentration solely on work and individual success mean that in he retirement he could find no solace in family in recreation in sport or in hobby it be almost as if the hole in he heart be so large that even the love of a family without work could not fill it as he spirit sag he body deteriorate until I believe he slowly bring about he own death in that last year he say he be so sad watch the American person look toward a new president and forget he he speak with immense sadness in he voice say maybe he should have spend more time with he child and they child in turn but it be too late despite all that power all that wealth he be alone when he finally die he ultimate terror realize so as for that third sphere of play which he never have learn to enjoy I have learn over the year that even this sphere require a commitment of time and energy enough so that a hobby a sport a love of music or art or literature or any form of recreation can provide true pleasure relaxation and replenishment so deep for instance be Abraham Lincoln love of Shakespeare that he make time to spend more than a hundred night in the theater even during that dark day of the war he say when the light go down and a Shakespeare play come on for a few precious hour he could imagine himself back in Prince Hal time but a even more important form of relaxation for he that Lyndon Johnson never could enjoy be a love of somehow humor and feel out what hilarious part of life can produce as a sidelight to the sadness he once say that he laugh so he do not cry that a good story for he be good than a drop of whiskey he storytelling power have first be recognize when he be on the circuit in Illinois the lawyer and the judge would travel from one county courthouse to the other and when anyone be know Lincoln be in town they would come from mile around to listen to he tell story he would stand with he back against a fire and entertain the crowd for hour with he wind tale and all this story become part of he memory bank so he could call on they whenever he need to and they be not quite what you might expect from we marble monument one of he favorite story for example have to do with the Revolutionary War hero Ethan Allen and as Lincoln tell the story Mr Allen go to Britain after the war and the British person be still upset about lose the Revolution so they decide to embarrass he a little bit by put a huge picture of General Washington in the only outhouse where he would have to encounter it they figure he would be upset about the indignity of George Washington be in a outhouse but he come out of the outhouse not upset at all and so they say well do you see George Washington in there oh yes he say perfectly appropriate place for he what do you mean they say well he say there be nothing to make a Englishman shit fast than the sight of General George Washington laughter applause so you can imagine if you be in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting and he have hundred of this story you would have to relax so between he nightly trek to the theater he story tell and he extraordinary sense of humor and he love of quote Shakespeare and poetry he find that form of play which carry he through he day in my own life I shall always be grateful for have find a form of play in my irrational love of baseball which allow I from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall to have something to occupy my mind and heart other than my work it all begin when I be only six year old and my father teach I that mysterious art of keep score while listen to baseball game so that when he go to work in New York during the day I could record for he the history of that afternoon Brooklyn Dodgers game now when you be only six year old and you father come home every single night and listen to you as I now realize that I in excruciating detail recount every single play of every inning of the game that have just take place that afternoon but he make I feel I be tell he a fabulous story it make you think there be something magic about history to keep you father attention in fact I be convinced I learn the narrative art from that nightly session with my father because at first I would be so excited I would blurt out the Dodgers win or the Dodgers lose which take much of the drama of this two hour tell away laughter so I finally learn you have to tell a story from begin to middle to end I must say so fervent be my love of the old Brooklyn Dodgers in that day that I have to confess in my first confession two sin that relate to baseball the first occur because the Dodgers catcher Roy Campanella come to my hometown of Rockville Centre Long Island just as I be in preparation for my first Holy Communion and I be so excited first person I have ever see outside of Ebbets Field but it so happen he be speak in a Protestant Church when you be bring up as a catholic you think that if you ever set foot in a Protestant Church you will be strike dead at the threshold so I go to my father in tear what be we go to do he say do not worry he be speak in a parish hall we be sit in folding chair he be talk about sportsmanship it be not a sin but as I leave that night I be certain that somehow I have trade the life of my everlasting soul for this one night with Roy Campanella laughter and there be no indulgence around that I could buy so I have this sin on my soul when I go to my first confession I tell the priest right away he say no problem it be not a religious service but then unfortunately he say and what else my child and then come my second sin I try to sandwich it in between talk too much in church wish harm to other be mean to my sister and he say to whom do you wish harm and I have to say that I wish that various New York Yankees player would break arm leg and ankle laughter so that the Brooklyn Dodgers could win they first World Series he say how often do you make this horrible wish and I have to say every night when I say my prayer laughter so he say look I will tell you something I love the Brooklyn Dodgers as you do but I promise you some day they will win fairly and squarely you do not need to wish harm on other to make it happen oh yes I say but luckily my first confession to a baseball love priest laughter well though my father die of a sudden heart attack when I be still in my 20 before I have get married and have my three son I have pass he memory as well as he love of baseball on to my boy though when the Dodgers abandon we to come to l a I lose faith in baseball until I move to Boston and become a irrational Red Socks fan and I must say even now when I sit with my son with we season ticket I can sometimes close my eye against the sun and imagine myself a young girl once more in the presence of my father watch the player of my youth on the grassy field below Jackie Robinson Roy Campanella Pee Wee Reese and Duke Snider I must say there be magic in this moment when I open my eye and I see my son in the place where my father once sit I feel a invisible loyalty and love link my son to the grandfather whose face they never have a chance to see but whose heart and soul they have come to know through all the story I have tell which be why in the end I shall always be grateful for this curious love of history allow I to spend a lifetime look back into the past allow I to learn from this large figure about the struggle for mean for life allow I to believe that the private person we have love and lose in we family and the public figure we have respect in we history just as Abraham Lincoln want to believe really can live on so long as we pledge to tell and to retell the story of they life thank you for let I be that storyteller today applause thank you
