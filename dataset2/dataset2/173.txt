we be go to go on a dive to the deep sea and anyone that be have that lovely opportunity know that for about two and half hour on the way down it be a perfectly positively pitch black world and we use to see the most mysterious animal out the window that you could not describe this blink light a world of bioluminescence like firefly Dr Edith Widder she be now at the Ocean Research and Conservation Association be able to come up with a camera that could capture some of this incredible animal and that be what you be see here on the screen that be all bioluminescence like I say just like firefly there be a fly turkey under a tree laughter I be a geologist by train but I love that and you see some of the bioluminescence they use to avoid be eat some they use to attract prey but all of it from a artistic point of view be just positively amazing and a lot of what go on inside there be a fish with glow eye pulsate eye some of the color be design to hypnotize this lovely pattern and then this last one one of my favorite this pinwheel design just absolutely amazing every single dive that be the unknown world and today we have only explore about 3 percent of what be out there in the ocean already we have find the world high mountain the world deep valley underwater lake underwater waterfall a lot of that we share with you from the stage and in a place where we think no life at all we find more life we think and diversity and density than the tropical rainforest which tell we that we do not know much about this planet at all there be still 97 percent and either that 97 percent be empty or just full of surprise but I want to jump up to shallow water now and look at some creature that be positively amazing Cephalopods head foot as a kid I know they as calamari mostly laughter this be a octopus this be the work of Dr Roger Hanlon at the Marine Biological Lab and it be just fascinating how cephalopod can with they incredible eye sense they surroundings look at light look at pattern here be a octopus move across the reef find a spot to settle down curl up and then disappear into the background tough thing to do in the next bit we be go to see a couple squid now male when they fight if they be really aggressive they turn white and this two male be fight they do it by bounce they butt together which be a interesting concept now here be a male on the left and a female on the right and the male have manage to split he coloration so the female only always see the kind gentler squid in he laughter let take a look at it again watch the coloration white on the right brown on the leave he take a step back he be keep off the other male by split he body and come up on the other side Bingo now I be tell that be not not just a squid phenomenon with male but I do not know laughter cuttlefish I love cuttlefish this be a giant Australian cuttlefish and there he be he droopy little eye up here but they can do pretty amazing thing too here we be go to see one backing into a crevice and watch he tentacle he just pull they in make they look just like alga disappear right into the background positively amazing here be two male fight once again they be smart enough this cephalopod they know not to hurt each other but look at the pattern that they can do with they skin that be a amazing thing here be a octopus sometimes they do not want to be see when they move because predator can see they this guy can make himself look like a rock and look at he environment can actually slide across the bottom use the wave and the shadow so he can not be see he motion blend right into the background the move rock trick so we be learn lot new from the shallow water still explore the deep but learn lot from the shallow water there be a good reason why the shallow water full of predator here be a barracuda and if you be a octopus or a cephalopod you need to really understand how to use you surroundings to hide in the next scene you be go to see a nice coral bottom and you see that a octopus would stand out very easily there if you could not use you camouflage use you skin to change color and texture here be some alga in the foreground and a octopus be not that amazing now Roger spook he so he take off in a cloud of ink and when he land the octopus say oh I have be see the good thing to do be to get as big as I can get that big brown make he eyespot very big so he be bluff let do it backwards I think he be joke when he first show it to I I think it be all graphic so here it be in reverse watch the skin color watch the skin texture just a amazing animal it can change color and texture to match the surroundings watch he blend right into this algae one two three applause and now he be go and so be I thank you very much applause
