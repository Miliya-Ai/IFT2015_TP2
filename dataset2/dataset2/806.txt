1960 they settle in a shady suburb about a hour east of Toronto and they settle into a new life they see they first dentist they eat they first hamburger and they have they first kid my sister and I grow up here and we have quiet happy childhood we have close family good friend a quiet street we grow up take for grant a lot of the thing that my parent could not take for grant when they grow up thing like power always on in we house thing like school across the street and hospital down the road and popsicle in the backyard we grow up and we grow old I go to high school I graduate I move out of the house I get a job I find a girl I settle down and I realize it sound like a bad sitcom or a cat Stevens song laughter but life be pretty good life be pretty good 2006 be a great year under clear blue sky in July in the wine region of Ontario I get married surround by 150 family and friend 2007 be a great year I graduate from school and I go on a road trip with two of my close friend here be a picture of I and my friend Chris on the coast of the Pacific Ocean we actually see seal out of we car window and we pull over to take a quick picture of they and then block they with we giant head laughter so you can not actually see they but it be breathtaking believe I laughter 2008 and 2009 be a little tough I know that they be tough for a lot of person not just I first of all the news be so heavy it be still heavy now and it be heavy before that but when you flip open a newspaper when you turn on the tv it be about ice cap melt war go on around the world earthquake hurricane and a economy that be wobble on the brink of collapse and then eventually do collapse and so many of we lose we home or we job or we retirement or we livelihood 2008 2009 be heavy year for I for another reason too I be go through a lot of personal problem at the time my marriage be not go well and we just be grow far and far apart one day my wife come home from work and summon the courage through a lot of tear to have a very honest conversation and she say I do not love you anymore and it be one of the most painful thing I would ever hear and certainly the most heartbreaking thing I have ever hear until only a month later when I hear something even more heartbreaking my friend Chris who I just show you a picture of have be battle mental illness for some time and for that of you whose life have be touch by mental illness you know how challenging it can be I speak to he on the phone at 10 30 p m on a Sunday night we talk about the tv show we watch that evening and Monday morning I find out that he disappear very sadly he take he own life and it be a really heavy time and as this dark cloud be circle I and I be find it really really difficult to think of anything good I say to myself that I really need a way to focus on the positive somehow so I come home from work one night and I log onto the computer and I start up a tiny website call 1000awesomethe com I be try to remind myself of the simple universal little pleasure that we all love but we just do not talk about enough thing like waiter and waitress who bring you free refill without ask be the first table to get call up to the dinner buffet at a wedding wear warm underwear from just out of the dryer or when cashier open up a new check out lane at the grocery store and you get to be first in line even if you be last at the other line swoop right in there laughter and slowly over time I start put myself in a good mood I mean 50 000 blog be start a day and so my blog be just one of that 50 000 and nobody read it except for my mom although I should say that my traffic do skyrocket and go up by 100 percent when she forward it to my dad laughter and then I get excited when it start get ten of hit and then I start get excited when it start get dozen and then hundred and then thousand and then million it start get big and big and big and then I get a phone call and the voice at the other end of the line say you have just win the good blog in the World award I be like that sound totally fake laughter applause which African country do you want I to wire all my money to laughter but it turn out I jump on a plane and I end up walk a red carpet between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart and I go onstage to accept a Webby award for good blog and the surprise and just the amazement of that be only overshadow by my return to Toronto when in my inbox 10 literary agent be wait for I to talk about put this into a book Flash forward to the next year and the Book of awesome have now be number one on the bestseller list for 20 straight week applause but look I say I want to do three thing with you today I say I want to tell you the awesome story I want to share with you the three as of awesome and I want to leave you with a closing think so let talk about that three as over the last few year I have not have that much time to really think but lately I have have the opportunity to take a step back and ask myself what be it over the last few year that help I grow my website but also grow myself and I have summarize that thing for I personally as three as they be attitude awareness and authenticity I would love to just talk about each one briefly so attitude look we be all go to get lump and we be all go to get bump none of we can predict the future but we do know one thing about it and that be that it be not go to go accord to plan we will all have high high and big day and proud moment of smile on graduation stage father daughter dance at wedding and healthy baby screech in the delivery room but between that high high we may also have some lump and some bump too it be sad and it be not pleasant to talk about but you husband might leave you you girlfriend could cheat you headache might be more serious than you think or you dog could get hit by a car on the street it be not a happy thought but you kid could get mix up in gang or bad scene you mom could get cancer you dad could get mean and there be time in life when you will be toss in the well too with twist in you stomach and with hole in you heart and when that bad news wash over you and when that pain sponge and soak in I just really hope you feel like you have always get two choice one you can swirl and twirl and gloom and doom forever or two you can grieve and then face the future with newly sober eye have a great attitude be about choose option number two and choose no matter how difficult it be no matter what pain hit you choose to move forward and move on and take baby step into the future the second a be awareness I love hang out with three year old I love the way that they see the world because they be see the world for the first time I love the way that they can stare at a bug cross the sidewalk I love the way that they will stare slack jaw at they first baseball game with wide eye and a mitt on they hand soak in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanut and the smell of the hotdog I love the way that they will spend hour pick dandelion in the backyard and put they into a nice centerpiece for Thanksgiving dinner I love the way that they see the world because they be see the world for the first time have a sense of awareness be just about embrace you inner three year old because you all use to be three year old that three year old boy be still part of you that three year old girl be still part of you they be in there and be aware be just about remember that you see everything you have see for the first time once too so there be a time when it be you first time ever hit a string of green light on the way home from work there be the first time you walk by the open door of a bakery and smell the bakery air or the first time you pull a 20 dollar bill out of you old jacket pocket and say find money the last a be authenticity and for this one I want to tell you a quick story let go all the way back to 1932 when on a peanut farm in Georgia a little baby boy name Roosevelt Grier be bear Roosevelt Grier or Rosey Grier as person use to call he grow up and grow into a 300 pound six foot five linebacker in the NFL he be number 76 in the picture here he be picture with the fearsome foursome this be four guy on the l a Rams in the 1960 you do not want to go up against they be tough football player do what they love which be crush skull and separate shoulder on the football field but Rosey Grier also have another passion in he deeply authentic self he also love needlepoint laughter he love knit he say that it calm he down it relax he it take away he fear of fly and help he meet chick that be what he say I mean he love it so much that after he retire from the NFL he start join club and he even put out a book call Rosey Grier needlepoint for man laughter applause it be a great cover if you notice he be actually needlepoint he own face laughter and so what I love about this story be that Rosey Grier be just such a authentic person and that be what authenticity be all about it be just about be you and be cool with that and I think when you be authentic you end up follow you heart and you put yourself in place and situation and in conversation that you love and that you enjoy you meet person that you like talk to you go place you have dream about and you end you end up follow you heart and feel very fulfil so that be the three a for the closing think I want to take you all the way back to my parent come to Canada I do not know what it would feel like come to a new country when you be in you mid 20 I do not know because I never do it but I would imagine that it would take a great attitude I would imagine that you would have to be pretty aware of you surroundings and appreciate the small wonder that you be start to see in you new world and I think you would have to be really authentic you would have to be really true to yourself in order to get through what you be be expose to I would like to pause my tedtalk for about 10 second right now because you do not get many opportunity in life to do something like this and my parent be sit in the front row so I want to ask they to if they do not mind stand up and I just want to say thank you to you guy applause when I be grow up my dad use to love tell the story of he first day in Canada and it be a great story because what happen be he get off the plane at the Toronto airport and he be welcome by a non profit group which I be sure someone in this room run laughter and this non profit group have a big welcoming lunch for all the new immigrant to Canada and my dad say he get off the plane and he go to this lunch and there be this huge spread there be bread there be that little mini dill pickle there be olive that little white onion there be roll up turkey cold cut roll up ham cold cut roll up roast beef cold cut and little cube of cheese there be tuna salad sandwich and egg salad sandwich and salmon salad sandwich there be lasagna there be casserole there be brownie there be butter tart and there be pie lot and lot of pie and when my dad tell the story he say the crazy thing be I would never see any of that before except bread laughter I do not know what be meat what be vegetarian I be eat olive with pie laughter I just could not believe how many thing you can get here laughter when I be five year old my dad use to take I grocery shopping and he would stare in wonder at the little sticker that be on the fruit and vegetable he would say look can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico they have get a apple here from South Africa can you believe they have get a date from Morocco he be like do you know where Morocco even be and I would say I be five I do not even know where I be be this a p and he would say I do not know where Morocco be either but let find out and so we have buy the date and we would go home and we would actually take a atla off the shelf and we would flip through until we find this mysterious country and when we do my dad would say can you believe someone climb a tree over there pick this thing off it put it in a truck drive it all the way to the dock and then sail it all the way across the Atlantic Ocean and then put it in another truck and drive that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside we house so they could sell it to we for 25 cent and I would say I do not believe that and he be like I do not believe it either thing be amazing there be just so many thing to be happy about when I stop to think about it he be absolutely right there be so many thing to be happy about we be the only species on the only life give rock in the entire universe that we have ever see capable of experience so many of this thing I mean we be the only one with architecture and agriculture we be the only one with jewelry and democracy we have get airplane highway lane interior design and horoscope sign we have get fashion magazine house party scene you can watch a horror movie with monster you can go to a concert and hear guitar jam we have get book buffet and radio wave wedding bride and rollercoaster ride you can sleep in clean sheet you can go to the movie and get good seat you can smell bakery air walk around with rain hair pop bubble wrap or take a illegal nap we have get all that but we have only get 100 year to enjoy it and that be the sad part the cashier at you grocery store the foreman at you plant the guy tailgate you home on the highway the telemarketer call you during dinner every teacher you have ever have everyone that be ever wake up beside you every politician in every country every actor in every movie every single person in you family everyone you love everyone in this room and you will be dead in a hundred year life be so great that we only get such a short time to experience and enjoy all that tiny little moment that make it so sweet and that moment be right now and that moment be count down and that moment be always always always fleeting you will never be as young as you be right now and that be why I believe that if you live you life with a great attitude choose to move forward and move on whenever life deal you a blow live with a sense of awareness of the world around you embrace you inner three year old and see the tiny joy that make life so sweet and be authentic to yourself be you and be cool with that let you heart lead you and put yourself in experience that satisfy you then I think you will live a life that be rich and be satisfy and I think you will live a life that be truly awesome
