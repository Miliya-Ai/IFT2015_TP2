Music Music end applause thank you applause continue thank you very much like the speaker before I I be a TED virgin I guess I be also the first time here and laughter I do not know what to say applause I be really happy that Mr Anderson invite I I be really grateful that I get a chance to play for everyone and the song that I just play be by Josef Hofmann it be call Kaleidoscope and Hofmann be a Polish pianist and composer of the late 19th century and he be widely consider one of the great pianist of all time I have another piece that I have like to play for you it be call Abegg Variations by Robert Schumann a German 19th century composer the name Abegg be actually a b e g g and that be the main theme in the melody play the note A B E G and G that come from the last name of one of Schumann female friend laughter but he write that for he wife laughter so actually if you listen carefully there be suppose to be five variation on this Abegg theme it be write around 1834 so even though it be old I hope you will like it Music Music end applause now come the part that I hate well because Mr Anderson tell I that this session be call Sync and Flow I be wonder what do I know that this genius do not laughter so I will talk about musical composition even though I do not know where to start how do I compose I think Yamaha do a really good job of teach we how to compose what I do first be I make a lot of little musical idea you can just improvise here at the piano and I choose one of that to become my main theme my main melody like the Abegg that you just hear and once I choose my main theme I have to decide out of all the style in music what kind of style do I want and this year I compose a romantic style so for inspiration I listen to Liszt and Tchaikovsky and all the great romantic composer next I make the structure of the entire piece with my teacher they help I plan out the whole piece and then the hard part be fill it in with musical idea because then you have to think laughter and then when the piece take somewhat of a solified form solidify excuse I solidify form you be suppose to actually polish the piece Polish the detail and then polish the overall performance of the composition and another thing that I enjoy do be draw draw because I like to draw you know Japanese anime art I think that be a craze among teens right now and once I realize it there be a parallel between create music and create art because for you motive or you little initial idea for you draw it be you character you want to decide who you want to draw or if you want to draw a original character and then you want to decide how be you go to draw the character like am I go to use one page be I go to draw it on the computer be I go to use a two page spread like a comic book for a more grandiose effect I guess and then you have to do the initial sketch of the character which be like you structure of a piece and then you add pen and pencil and whatever detail that you need that be polish the drawing and another thing that both of this have in common be you state of mind because I know I be one of that teenager that be really easily distract so if I be try to do homework and I do not feel like it I will try to draw or you know waste my time and then what happen be sometimes I absolutely can not draw or I can not compose at all and then it be like there be too much on you mind you can not focus on what you be suppose to do and sometimes if you manage to use you time wisely and work on it you will get something out of it but it do not come naturally what happen be if something magical happen if something natural happen to you you be able to produce all this beautiful stuff instantly and then that be what I consider flow because that be when everything click and you be able to do anything you feel like you be on top of you game and you can do anything you want I be not go to play my own composition today because although I do finish it it be way too long instead I would like to try something call improvisation I have here seven note card one with each note of the musical alphabet and I would like someone to come up here and choose five anyone to come up here and choose five and then I can make it into some sort of melody and I will improvise it wow a volunteer yay laughter applause Jennifer Lin Nice to meet you Goldie Hawn thank you
