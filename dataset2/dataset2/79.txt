it be a thrill to be here at a conference that be devote to inspire by Nature you can imagine and I be also thrilled to be in the foreplay section do you notice this section be foreplay because I get to talk about one of my favorite critter which be the western Grebe you have not live until you have see this guy do they courtship dance I be on Bowman Lake in Glacier National Park which be a long skinny lake with sort of mountain upside down in it and my partner and I have a rowing shell and so we be rowing and one of this western grebe come along and what they do for they courtship dance be they go together the two of they the two mate and they begin to run underwater they paddle fast and fast and fast until they be go so fast that they literally lift up out of the water and they be stand upright sort of paddle the top of the water and one of this grebe come along while we be rowing and so we be in a skull and we be move really really quickly and this Grebe I think sort of mistake we for a prospect and start to run along the water next to we in a courtship dance for mile it would stop and then start and then stop and then start now that be foreplay laughter I come this close to change species at that moment obviously life can teach we something in the entertainment section life have a lot to teach we but what I would like to talk about today be what life might teach we in technology and in design what be happen since the book come out the book be mainly about research in biomimicry and what be happen since then be architect designer engineer person who make we world have start to call and say we want a biologist to sit at the design table to help we in real time become inspired or and this be the fun part for I we want you to take we out into the natural world we will come with a design challenge and we find the champion adapter in the natural world who might inspire we so this be a picture from a Galapagos trip that we take with some wastewater treatment engineer they purify wastewater and some of they be very resistant actually to be there what they say to we at first be you know we already do biomimicry we use bacterium to clean we water and we say well that be not exactly be inspire by nature that be bioprocess you know that be bio assist technology use a organism to do you wastewater treatment be a old old technology call domestication this be learn something learn a idea from a organism and then apply it and so they still be not get it so we go for a walk on the beach and I say well give I one of you big problem give I a design challenge sustainability speed bump that be keep you from be sustainable and they say scaling which be the build up of mineral inside of pipe and they say you know what happen be mineral just like at you house mineral build up and then the aperture close and we have to flush the pipe with toxin or we have to dig they up so if we have some way to stop this scaling and so I pick up some shell on the beach and I ask they what be scale what be inside you pipe and they say calcium carbonate and I say that be what this be this be calcium carbonate and they do not know that they do not know that what a seashell be it be template by proteins and then ion from the seawater crystallize in place to create a shell so the same sort of a process without the proteins be happen on the inside of they pipe they do not know this be not for lack of information it be a lack of integration you know it be a silo person in silo they do not know that the same thing be happen so one of they think about it and say ok well if this be just crystallization that happen automatically out of seawater self assembly then why be not shell infinite in size what stop the scaling why do not they just keep on go and I say well in the same way that they exude a protein and it start the crystallization and then they all sort of lean in they let go of a protein that stop the crystallization it literally adhere to the grow face of the crystal and in fact there be a product call TPA that be mimic that protein that stop protein and it be a environmentally friendly way to stop scale in pipe that change everything from then on you could not get this engineer back in the boat the first day they would take a hike and it be click click click click five minute later they be back in the boat we be do you know I have see that island after this they be crawl all over they would snorkel for as long as we would let they snorkel what have happen be that they realize that there be organism out there that have already solve the problem that they have spend they career try to solve learn about the natural world be one thing learn from the natural world that be the switch that be the profound switch what they realize be that the answer to they question be everywhere they just need to change the lens with which they see the world 3 8 billion year of field testing 10 to 30 Craig Venter will probably tell you I think there be a lot more than 30 million well adapt solution the important thing for I be that this be solution solve in context and the context be the Earth the same context that we be try to solve we problem in so it be the conscious emulation of life genius it be not slavishly mimic although Al be try to get the hairdo go it be not a slavish mimicry it be take the design principle the genius of the natural world and learning something from it now in a group with so many it person I do have to mention what I be not go to talk about and that be that you field be one that have learn a enormous amount from live thing on the software side so there be computer that protect themselves like a immune system and we be learn from gene regulation and biological development and we be learn from neural net genetic algorithm evolutionary computing that be on the software side but what be interesting to I be that we have not look at this as much I mean this machine be really not very high tech in my estimation in the sense that there be dozen and dozen of carcinogen in the water in Silicon Valley so the hardware be not at all up to snuff in term of what life would call a success so what can we learn about make not just computer but everything the plane you come in car the seat that you be sit on how do we redesign the world that we make the human make world more importantly what should we ask in the next 10 year and there be a lot of cool technology out there that life have what be the syllabus three question for I be key how do life make thing this be the opposite this be how we make thing it be call heat beat and treat that be what material scientist call it and it be carve thing down from the top with 96 percent waste leave over and only 4 percent product you heat it up you beat it with high pressure you use chemical ok heat beat and treat life can not afford to do that how do life make thing how do life make the most of thing that be a geranium pollen and its shape be what give it the function of be able to tumble through air so easily look at that shape life add information to matter in other word structure it give it information by add information to matter it give it a function that be different than without that structure and thirdly how do life make thing disappear into system because life do not really deal in thing there be no thing in the natural world divorce from they system really quick syllabus as I be read more and more now and follow the story there be some amazing thing come up in the biological science and at the same time I be listen to a lot of business and find what they sort of grand challenge be the two group be not talk to each other at all what in the world of biology might be helpful at this juncture to get we through this sort of evolutionary knothole that we be in I be go to try to go through 12 really quickly one that be exciting to I be self assembly now you have hear about this in term of nanotechnology back to that shell the shell be a self assemble material on the low left there be a picture of mother of pearl form out of seawater it be a layered structure that be mineral and then polymer and it make it very very tough it be twice as tough as we high tech ceramic but what be really interesting unlike we ceramic that be in kiln it happen in seawater it happen near in and near the organism body this be Sandia National Labs a guy name Jeff Brinker have find a way to have a self assemble code process imagine be able to make ceramic at room temperature by simply dip something into a liquid lift it out of the liquid and have evaporation force the molecule in the liquid together so that they jigsaw together in the same way as this crystallization work imagine make all of we hard material that way imagine spray the precursor to a pv cell to a solar cell onto a roof and have it self assemble into a layered structure that harvest light here be a interesting one for the it world bio silicon this be a diatom which be make of silicate and so silicon which we make right now it be part of we carcinogenic problem in the manufacture of we chip this be a bio mineralization process that be now be mimic this be at UC Santa Barbara look at this diatom this be from Ernst Haeckel work imagine be able to and again it be a templated process and it solidify out of a liquid process imagine be able to have that sort of structure come out at room temperature imagine be able to make perfect lens on the leave this be a brittle star it be cover with lens that the person at Lucent Technologies have find have no distortion whatsoever it be one of the most distortion free lens we know of and there be many of they all over its entire body what be interesting again be that it self assemble a woman name Joanna Aizenberg at Lucent be now learn to do this in a low temperature process to create this sort of lens she be also look at fiber optics that be a sea sponge that have a fiber optic down at the very base of it there be fiber optics that work good than ours actually to move light but you can tie they in a knot they be incredibly flexible here be another big idea co2 as a feedstock a guy name Geoff Coates at Cornell say to himself you know plant do not see co2 as the big poison of we time we see it that way plant be busy make long chain of starch and glucose right out of co2 he be find a way he be find a catalyst and he be find a way to take co2 and make it into polycarbonate biodegradable plastic out of co2 how plant like solar transformation the most exciting one there be person who be mimic the energy harvesting device inside of purple bacterium the person at ASU even more interesting lately in the last couple of week person have see that there be a enzyme call hydrogenase that be able to evolve hydrogen from proton and electron and be able to take hydrogen up basically what be happen in a fuel cell in the anode of a fuel cell and in a reversible fuel cell in we fuel cell we do it with platinum life do it with a very very common iron and a team have now just be able to mimic that hydrogen juggle hydrogenase that be very exciting for fuel cell to be able to do that without platinum power of shape here be a whale we have see that the fin of this whale have tubercle on they and that little bump actually increase efficiency in for instance the edge of a airplane increase efficiency by about 32 percent which be a amazing fossil fuel savings if we be to just put that on the edge of a wing color without pigment this peacock be create color with shape light come through it bounce back off the layer it be call thin film interference imagine be able to self assemble product with the last few layer play with light to create color imagine be able to create a shape on the outside of a surface so that it be self clean with just water that be what a leaf do see that up close picture that be a ball of water and that be dirt particle and that be a up close picture of a lotus leaf there be a company make a product call Lotusan which mimic when the building facade paint dry it mimic the bump in a self clean leaf and rainwater clean the building water be go to be we big grand challenge quench thirst here be two organism that pull water the one on the left be the Namibian beetle pull water out of fog the one on the right be a pill bug pull water out of air do not drink fresh water pull water out of Monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in Atlanta before it get into a building be key technology separation technology be go to be extremely important what if we be to say no more hard rock mining what if we be to separate out metal from waste stream small amount of metal in water that be what microbe do they chelate metal out of water there be a company here in San Francisco call mr3 that be embed mimic of the microbe molecule on filter to mine waste stream green chemistry be chemistry in water we do chemistry in organic solvent this be a picture of the spinneret come out of a spider and the silk be form from a spider be not that beautiful green chemistry be replace we industrial chemistry with nature recipe book it be not easy because life use only a subset of the element in the periodic table and we use all of they even the toxic one to figure out the elegant recipe that would take the small subset of the periodic table and create miracle material like that cell be the task of green chemistry time degradation packaging that be good until you do not want it to be good anymore and dissolve on cue that be a mussel you can find in the water out here and the thread hold it to a rock be time at exactly two year they begin to dissolve Healing this be a good one that little guy over there be a tardigrade there be a problem with vaccine around the world not get to patient and the reason be that the refrigeration somehow get break what be call the cold chain get break a guy name Bruce Rosner look at the tardigrade which dry out completely and yet stay alive for month and month and month and be able to regenerate itself and he find a way to dry out vaccine encase they in the same sort of sugar capsule as the tardigrade have within its cell mean that vaccine no long need to be refrigerate they can be put in a glove compartment ok learning from organism this be a session about water learning about organism that can do without water in order to create a vaccine that last and last and last without refrigeration I be not go to get to 12 but what I be go to do be tell you that the most important thing besides all of this adaptation be the fact that this organism have figure out a way to do the amazing thing they do while take care of the place that be go to take care of they offspring when they be involve in foreplay they be think about something very very important and that be have they genetic material remain 10 000 generation from now and that mean find a way to do what they do without destroy the place that will take care of they offspring that be the big design challenge luckily there be million and million of genius willing to gift we with they good idea good luck have a conversation with they thank you applause Chris Anderson talk about foreplay I we need to get to 12 but really quickly Janine Benyus oh really CA yeah just like you know like the 10 second version of 10 11 and 12 because we just you slide be so gorgeous and the idea be so big I can not stand to let you go down without see 10 11 and 12 JB OK put this ok I will just hold this thing ok great ok so that be the healing one sense and respond feedback be a huge thing this be a locust there can be 80 million of they in a square kilometer and yet they do not collide with one another and yet we have 3 6 million car collision a year laughter right there be a person at Newcastle who have figure out that it be a very large neuron and she be actually figure out how to make a collision avoidance circuitry base on this very large neuron in the locust this be a huge and important one number 11 and that be the grow fertility that mean you know net fertility farming we should be grow fertility and oh yes we get food too because we have to grow the capacity of this planet to create more and more opportunity for life and really that be what other organism do as well in ensemble that be what whole ecosystem do they create more and more opportunity for life we farm have do the opposite so farm base on how a prairie build soil ranch base on how a native ungulate herd actually increase the health of the range even wastewater treatment base on how a marsh not only clean the water but create incredibly sparkling productivity this be the simple design brief I mean it look simple because the system over 3 8 billion year have work this out that be that organism that have not be able to figure out how to enhance or sweeten they place be not around to tell we about it that be the twelfth one life and this be the secret trick this be the magic trick life create condition conducive to life it build soil it clean air it clean water it mix the cocktail of gas that you and I need to live and it do that in the middle of have great foreplay and meet they need so it be not mutually exclusive we have to find a way to meet we need while make of this place a Eden CA Janine thank you so much applause
