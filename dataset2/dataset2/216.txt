in the year 1919 a virtually unknown German mathematician name Theodor Kaluza suggest a very bold and in some way a very bizarre idea he propose that we universe might actually have more than the three dimension that we be all aware of that be in addition to leave right back forth and up down Kaluza propose that there might be additional dimension of space that for some reason we do not yet see now when someone make a bold and bizarre idea sometimes that be all it be bold and bizarre but it have nothing to do with the world around we this particular idea however although we do not yet know whether it be right or wrong and at the end I will discuss experiment which in the next few year may tell we whether it be right or wrong this idea have have a major impact on physics in the last century and continue to inform a lot of cut edge research so I would like to tell you something about the story of this extra dimension so where do we go to begin we need a little bit of back story go to 1907 this be a year when Einstein be bask in the glow of have discover the special theory of relativity and decide to take on a new project to try to understand fully the grand pervasive force of gravity and in that moment there be many person around who think that that project have already be resolve Newton have give the world a theory of gravity in the late 1600 that work well describe the motion of planet the motion of the moon and so forth the motion of apocryphal of apple fall from tree hit person on the head all of that could be describe use Newton work but Einstein realize that Newton have leave something out of the story because even Newton have write that although he understand how to calculate the effect of gravity he have be unable to figure out how it really work how be it that the Sun 93 million mile away that somehow it affect the motion of the Earth how do the Sun reach out across empty inert space and exert influence and that be a task to which Einstein set himself to figure out how gravity work and let I show you what it be that he find so Einstein find that the medium that transmit gravity be space itself the idea go like this imagine space be a substrate of all there be Einstein say space be nice and flat if there be no matter present but if there be matter in the environment such as the Sun it cause the fabric of space to warp to curve and that communicate the force of gravity even the Earth warp space around it now look at the Moon The Moon be keep in orbit accord to this idea because it roll along a valley in the curved environment that the Sun and the Moon and the Earth can all create by virtue of they presence we go to a full frame view of this the Earth itself be keep in orbit because it roll along a valley in the environment that be curved because of the Sun presence that be this new idea about how gravity actually work now this idea be test in 1919 through astronomical observation it really work it describe the datum and this gain Einstein prominence around the world and that be what get Kaluza think he like Einstein be in search of what we call a unify theory that be one theory that might be able to describe all of nature force from one set of idea one set of principle one master equation if you will so Kaluza say to himself Einstein have be able to describe gravity in term of warp and curve in space in fact space and time to be more precise maybe I can play the same game with the other known force which be at that time know as the electromagnetic force we know of other today but at that time that be the only other one person be think about you know the force responsible for electricity and magnetic attraction and so forth so Kaluza say maybe I can play the same game and describe electromagnetic force in term of warp and curve that raise a question warp and curve in what Einstein have already use up space and time warp and curve to describe gravity there do not seem to be anything else to warp or curve so Kaluza say well maybe there be more dimension of space he say if I want to describe one more force maybe I need one more dimension so he imagine that the world have four dimension of space not three and imagine that electromagnetism be warp and curve in that fourth dimension now here be the thing when he write down the equation describe warp and curve in a universe with four space dimension not three he find the old equation that Einstein have already derive in three dimension that be for gravity but he find one more equation because of the one more dimension and when he look at that equation it be none other than the equation that scientist have long know to describe the electromagnetic force amazing it just pop out he be so excited by this realization that he run around he house scream victory that he have find the unified theory now clearly Kaluza be a man who take theory very seriously he in fact there be a story that when he want to learn how to swim he read a book a treatise on swimming laughter then dive into the ocean this be a man who would risk he life on theory now but for that of we who be a little bit more practically minded two question immediately arise from he observation number one if there be more dimension in space where be they we do not seem to see they and number two do this theory really work in detail when you try to apply it to the world around we now the first question be answer in 1926 by a fellow name Oskar Klein he suggest that dimension might come in two variety there might be big easy to see dimension but there might also be tiny curl up dimension curl up so small even though they be all around we that we do not see they let I show you that one visually so imagine you be look at something like a cable support a traffic light it be in Manhattan you be in Central Park it be kind of irrelevant but the cable look one dimensional from a distant viewpoint but you and I all know that it do have some thickness it be very hard to see it though from far away but if we zoom in and take the perspective of say a little ant walk around little ant be so small that they can access all of the dimension the long dimension but also this clockwise counter clockwise direction and I hope you appreciate this it take so long to get this ant to do this laughter but this illustrate the fact that dimension can be of two sort big and small and the idea that maybe the big dimension around we be the one that we can easily see but there might be additional dimension curl up sort of like the circular part of that cable so small that they have so far remain invisible let I show you what that would look like so if we take a look say at space itself I can only show of course two dimension on a screen some of you guy will fix that one day but anything that be not flat on a screen be a new dimension go small small small and way down in the microscopic depths of space itself this be the idea you could have additional curl up dimension here be a little shape of a circle so small that we do not see they but if you be a little ultra microscopic ant walk around you could walk in the big dimension that we all know about that be like the grid part but you could also access the tiny curl up dimension that be so small that we can not see it with the naked eye or even with any of we most refined equipment but deeply tuck into the fabric of space itself the idea be there could be more dimension as we see there now that be a explanation about how the universe could have more dimension than the one that we see but what about the second question that I ask do the theory actually work when you try to apply it to the real world well it turn out that Einstein and Kaluza and many other work on try to refine this framework and apply it to the physics of the universe as be understand at the time and in detail it do not work in detail for instance they could not get the mass of the electron to work out correctly in this theory so many person work on it but by the 40 certainly by the 50 this strange but very compelling idea of how to unify the law of physics have go away until something wonderful happen in we age in we era a new approach to unify the law of physics be be pursue by physicist such as myself many other around the world it be call superstring theory as you be indicate and the wonderful thing be that superstring theory have nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimension but when we study superstr theory we find that it resurrect the idea in a sparkling new form so let I just tell you how that go superstr theory what be it well it be a theory that try to answer the question what be the basic fundamental indivisible uncuttable constituent make up everything in the world around we the idea be like this so imagine we look at a familiar object just a candle in a holder and imagine that we want to figure out what it be make of so we go on a journey deep inside the object and examine the constituent so deep inside we all know you go sufficiently far down you have atom we also all know that atom be not the end of the story they have little electron that swarm around a central nucleus with neutron and proton even the neutron and proton have small particle inside of they know as quark that be where conventional idea stop here be the new idea of string theory Deep inside any of this particle there be something else this something else be this dancing filament of energy it look like a vibrate string that be where the idea string theory come from and just like the vibrate string that you just see in a cello can vibrate in different pattern this can also vibrate in different pattern they do not produce different musical note rather they produce the different particle make up the world around we so if this idea be correct this be what the ultra microscopic landscape of the universe look like it be build up of a huge number of this little tiny filament of vibrate energy vibrate in different frequency the different frequency produce the different particle the different particle be responsible for all the richness in the world around we and there you see unification because matter particle electron and quark radiation particle photon graviton be all build up from one entity so matter and the force of nature all be put together under the rubric of vibrate string and that be what we mean by a unified theory now here be the catch when you study the mathematics of string theory you find that it do not work in a universe that just have three dimension of space it do not work in a universe with four dimension of space nor five nor six finally you can study the equation and show that it work only in a universe that have 10 dimension of space and one dimension of time it lead we right back to this idea of Kaluza and Klein that we world when appropriately describe have more dimension than the one that we see now you might think about that and say well ok you know if you have extra dimension and they be really tightly curl up yeah perhaps we will not see they if they be small enough but if there be a little tiny civilization of green person walk around down there and you make they small enough and we will not see they either that be true one of the other prediction of string theory no that be not one of the other prediction of string theory laughter but it raise the question be we just try to hide away this extra dimension or do they tell we something about the world in the remain time I would like to tell you two feature of they first be many of we believe that this extra dimension hold the answer to what perhaps be the deep question in theoretical physics theoretical science and that question be this when we look around the world as scientist have do for the last hundred year there appear to be about 20 number that really describe we universe this be number like the mass of the particle like electron and quark the strength of gravity the strength of the electromagnetic force a list of about 20 number that have be measure with incredible precision but nobody have a explanation for why the number have the particular value that they do now do string theory offer a answer not yet but we believe the answer for why that number have the value they do may rely on the form of the extra dimension and the wonderful thing be if that number have any other value than the know one the universe as we know it would not exist this be a deep question why be that number so finely tune to allow star to shine and planet to form when we recognize that if you fiddle with that number if I have 20 dial up here and I let you come up and fiddle with that number almost any fiddle make the universe disappear so can we explain that 20 number and string theory suggest that that 20 number have to do with the extra dimension let I show you how so when we talk about the extra dimension in string theory it be not one extra dimension as in the old idea of Kaluza and Klein this be what string theory say about the extra dimension they have a very rich intertwined geometry this be a example of something know as a Calabi Yau shape name be not all that important but as you can see the extra dimension fold in on themselves and intertwine in a very interesting shape interesting structure and the idea be that if this be what the extra dimension look like then the microscopic landscape of we universe all around we would look like this on the tiny of scale when you swing you hand you would be move around this extra dimension over and over again but they be so small that we would not know it so what be the physical implication though relevant to that 20 number consider this if you look at the instrument a French horn notice that the vibration of the airstream be affect by the shape of the instrument now in string theory all the number be reflection of the way string can vibrate so just as that airstream be affect by the twist and turn in the instrument string themselves will be affect by the vibrational pattern in the geometry within which they be move so let I bring some string into the story and if you watch this little fellow vibrate around they will be there in a second right there notice that they way they vibrate be affect by the geometry of the extra dimension so if we know exactly what the extra dimension look like we do not yet but if we do we should be able to calculate the allow note the allow vibrational pattern and if we could calculate the allow vibrational pattern we should be able to calculate that 20 number and if the answer that we get from we calculation agree with the value of that number that have be determine through detailed and precise experimentation this in many way would be the first fundamental explanation for why the structure of the universe be the way it be now the second issue that I want to finish up with be how might we test for this extra dimension more directly be this just a interesting mathematical structure that might be able to explain some previously unexplained feature of the world or can we actually test for this extra dimension and we think and this be I think very exciting that in the next five year or so we may be able to test for the existence of this extra dimension here be how it go in CERN Geneva Switzerland a machine be be build call the large Hadron Collider it be a machine that will send particle around a tunnel opposite direction near the speed of light every so often that particle will be aim at each other so there be a head on collision the hope be that if the collision have enough energy it may eject some of the debris from the collision from we dimension force it to enter into the other dimension how would we know it well we will measure the amount of energy after the collision compare it to the amount of energy before and if there be less energy after the collision than before this will be evidence that the energy have drift away and if it drift away in the right pattern that we can calculate this will be evidence that the extra dimension be there let I show you that idea visually so imagine we have a certain kind of particle call a graviton that be the kind of debris we expect to be eject out if the extra dimension be real but here be how the experiment will go you take this particle you slam they together you slam they together and if we be right some of the energy of that collision will go into debris that fly off into this extra dimension so this be the kind of experiment that we will be look at in the next five seven to 10 year or so and if this experiment bear fruit if we see that kind of particle eject by notice that there be less energy in we dimension than when we begin this will show that the extra dimension be real and to I this be a really remarkable story and a remarkable opportunity go back to Newton with absolute space do not provide anything but a arena a stage in which the event of the universe take place Einstein come along and say well space and time can warp and curve that be what gravity be and now string theory come along and say yes gravity quantum mechanic electromagnetism all together in one package but only if the universe have more dimension than the one that we see and this be a experiment that may test for they in we lifetime amazing possibility thank you very much applause
