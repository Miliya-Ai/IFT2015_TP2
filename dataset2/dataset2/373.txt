right when I be 15 be when I first get interested in solar energy my family have move from Fort Lee New Jersey to California from the snow to lot of heat and gas line there be gas rationing in 1973 the energy crisis be in full bore I start read Popular Science magazine and I get really excited about the potential of solar energy to try and solve that crisis I have just take trigonometry in high school I learn about the parabola and how it could concentrate ray of light to a single focus that get I very excited and I really feel that there would be potential to build some kind of thing that could concentrate light so I start this company call Solar Devices and this be a company where I build parabola I take metal shop and I remember walk into metal shop building parabola and Stirling engine and I be build a Stirling engine over on the lathe and all the motorcycle guy say you be build a bong be not you and I say no it be a Stirling engine but they do not believe I I sell the plan for this engine and for this dish in the back of Popular Science magazine for four dollar each and I earn enough money to pay for my first year of Caltech it be a really big excitement for I to get into Caltech and at my first year at Caltech I continue the business but then in the second year of Caltech they start grade the whole first year be pass fail but the second year be grade I be not able to keep up with the business and I end up with a 25 year detour my dream have be to convert solar energy at a very practical cost but then I have this big detour first the coursework at Caltech then when I graduate from Caltech the IBM pc come out and I get addict to the IBM pc in 1981 and then in 1983 Lotus 1 2 3 come out and I be completely blow away by Lotus 1 2 3 I begin operate my business with 1 2 3 begin write add in for 1 2 3 write a natural language interface to 1 2 3 I start a educational software company after I join Lotus and then I start Idealab so I could have a roof under which I could build multiple company in succession much later in 2000 very recently the new California energy crisis what be purport to be a big energy crisis be come and I be try to figure out if we could build something that would capitalize on that and get person backup energy in case the crisis really come and I start look at how we could build battery backup system that could give person five hour 10 hour maybe even a full day or three day worth of backup power I be glad you hear early today battery be unbelievably lack density compare to fuel so much more energy can be store with fuel than with battery you would have to fill you entire parking space of one garage space just to give yourself four hour of battery backup and I conclude after research every other technology that we could deploy for store energy flywheel different formulation of battery it just be not practical to store energy so what about make energy maybe we could make energy I try to figure out maybe solar become attractive it be be 25 year since I be do this let I go back and look at what be be happen with solar cell and the price have go down from 10 dollar a watt to about four or five dollar a watt but it stabilize and it need to get much low to be cost effective I study all the new thing that have happen in solar cell and be look for way we could make solar cell more inexpensively a lot of new thing be happen to do that but fundamentally the process require a tremendous amount of energy some person say it take more energy to make a solar cell than it will give out in its entire life if we reduce the amount of energy it take to make the cell that will become more practical but right now you pretty much have to take silicon put it in a oven at 1600 f for 17 hour to make the cell a lot of person be work to try and reduce that but I do not have anything to contribute so I try to figure out what other way could we try to make cost effective solar electricity what if we collect the sun with a large reflector like I have be think about in high school but maybe with modern technology we could make it cheap concentrate it to a small converter and then the conversion device would not have to be as expensive because it be much small rather than solar cell which have to cover the entire surface that you want to gather sun from this seem practical now because a lot of new technology have come in the 25 year since I have last look at it there be a lot of new manufacturing technique not to mention really cheap miniature motor brushless motor servomotor stepper motor that be use in printer and scanner so that be a breakthrough of course inexpensive microprocessor and a very important breakthrough genetic algorithm I will be very short on genetic algorithm it be a powerful way of solve intractable problem use natural selection you take a problem that you can not solve with a pure mathematical answer you build a evolutionary system to try multiple try at guess you add sex where you take half of one solution and half of another and then make new mutation and you use natural selection to kill off not as good solution usually with a genetic algorithm on a computer today with a three gigahertz processor you can solve many formerly intractable problem in just a matter of minute so we try to come up with a way to use genetic algorithm to create a new type of concentrator and I will show you what we come up with traditionally concentrator look like this that shape be parabola they take all the parallel incoming ray and focus it to a single spot they have to track the sun because they have to point directly at the sun they usually have a one degree acceptance angle once they be more than a degree off none of the sunlight ray will hit the focus so we try to come up with a non track collector that would gather much more than one degree of light with no move part so we create a genetic algorithm to try this out we make a model in Excel of a multisurface reflector and a amazing thing evolve literally from try a billion cycle a billion different attempt with a fitness function that define how can you collect the most light from the most angle over a day from the sun and this be the shape that evolve it be this non track collector with this six tuba like horn and each of they collect light in the follow way if the sunlight strike right here it might bounce right to the center the hot spot directly but if the sun be off axis and come from the side it might hit two place and take two bounce so for direct light it take only one bounce for off axis light it might take two and for extreme off axis it might take three you efficiency go down with more bounce because you lose about 10 percent with each bounce but this allow we to collect light from a plus or minus 25 degree angle so about two and a half hour of the day we could collect with a stationary component solar cell collect light for four and a half hour though on a average adjusted day a solar cell because the sun move across the sky the solar cell be go down with a sine wave function of performance at the off axis angle it collect about four and a half average hour of sunlight a day so even this although it be great with no move part we could achieve high temperature be not enough we need to beat solar cell so we take a look at another idea we look at a way to break up a parabola into individual petal that would track so what you see here be 12 separate petal that each could be control with individual microprocessor that would only cost a dollar you can buy a two megahertz microprocessor for a dollar now and you can buy stepper motor that pretty much never wear out because they have no brush for a dollar so we can control all 12 of this petal for under 50 dollar and what this would allow we to do be not have to move the focus any more but only move the petal the whole system would have a much low profile but also we could gather sunlight for six and a half to seven hour a day now that we have concentrate sunlight what be we go to put at the center to convert sunlight to electricity so we try to look at all the different heat engine that have be use in history to convert sunlight or heat to electricity and one of the great one of all time James Watt steam engine of 1788 be a major breakthrough James Watt do not actually invent the steam engine he just refine it but he refinement be incredible he add new linear motion guide to the piston he add a condenser to cool the steam outside the cylinder he make the engine double acting so it have double the power that be major breakthrough all of the improvement he make and it be justifiable that we measure of energy the watt today be name after he so we look at this engine and this have some potential steam engine be dangerous and they have tremendous impact on the world industrial revolution and ship and locomotive but they be usually good to be large so they be not good for distribute power generation they be also very high pressure so they be dangerous another type of engine be the hot air engine and the hot air engine also be not invent by Robert Stirling but Robert Stirling come along in 1816 and radically improve it this engine because it be so interesting it only work on air no steam have lead to hundred of creative design over the year that use the Stirling engine principle but after the Stirling engine Otto come along and also he do not invent the internal combustion engine he just refine it he show it in Paris in 1867 and it be a major achievement because it bring the power density of the engine way up you could now get a lot more power in a lot small space and that allow the engine to be use for mobile application so once you have mobility you be make a lot of engine because you have get lot of unit as oppose to steam ship or big factory so this be the engine that end up benefit from mass production where all the other engine do not so because it go into mass production cost be reduce 100 year of refinement emission be reduce tremendous production value there have be hundred of million of internal combustion engine build compare to thousand of Stirling engine build and not nearly as many small steam engine be build anymore only large one for big operation so after look at this three and 47 other we conclude that the Stirling engine would be the good one to use I want to give you a brief explanation of how we look at it and how it work so we try to look at the Stirling engine in a new way because it be practical weight no long matter for we application the internal combustion engine take off because weight matter because you be move around but if you be try to generate solar energy in a static place the weight do not matter so much we also discover that efficiency do not matter so much if you energy source be free normally efficiency be crucial because the fuel cost of you engine over its life dwarf the cost of the engine but if you fuel source be free then the only thing that matter be the up front capital cost of the engine so you do not want to optimize for efficiency you want to optimize for power per dollar so use that new twist with the new criterion we think we could relook at the Stirling engine and also bring genetic algorithm in basically Robert Stirling do not have Gordon Moore before he to get we three gigahertz of processor power so we take the same genetic algorithm that we use early to make that concentrator which do not work out for we to optimize the Stirling engine and make its design size and all of its dimension the exact optimum to get the most power per dollar irrespective of weight irrespective of size just to get the most conversion of solar energy because the sun be free and that be the process we take let I show you how the engine work the simple heat engine or hot air engine of all time would be this take a box a steel canister with a piston put a flame under it the piston move up take it off the flame and pour water on it or let it cool down the piston move down that be a heat engine that be the most fundamental heat engine you could have the problem be the efficiency be one hundredth of one percent because you be heat all the metal of the chamber and then cool all the metal of the chamber each time and you be only get power from the air that be heat at the same time but you be waste energy heating and cool the metal so someone come up with a very clever idea instead of heating and cool the whole cylinder what about if you put a displacer inside a little thing that shuttle the air back and forth you move that up and down with a little bit of energy but now you be only shift the air down to the hot end and up to the cold end so now you be not alternately heat and cool the metal just the air that allow you to get the efficiency up from a hundredth of a percent to about two percent and then Robert Stirling come along with this genius idea which be well I be still not heat the metal now with this kind of engine but I be still reheat all the air I be still heat the air every time and cool the air every time what about if I put a thermal sponge in the middle in the passageway between where the air have to move between hot and cold so he make fine wire and crack glass and all different kind of material to be a heat sponge so when the air push up to go from the hot end to the cold end it put some heat into the sponge and then when the air come back after it be be cool it pick up that heat again so you be reuse you energy five or six time and that bring the efficiency up to between 30 and 40 percent it be a little known but brilliant genius invention of Robert Stirling that take the hot air engine from be somewhat impractical like I find out when I make the real simple version in high school to very potentially possible once you get the efficiency up if you can design this to be low enough cost so we really set out on a path to try and make the low cost possible we build a huge mathematical model of how a Stirling engine work we apply the genetic algorithm we get the result from that for the optimal engine we build engine so we build 100 different engine over the last two year we measure each one we readjust the model to what we measure and then we lead that to the current prototype it lead to a very compact inexpensive engine and this be what the engine look like let I show you what it look like in real life so this be the engine it be just a small cylinder down here which hold the generator inside and all the linkage and it be the hot cap the hot cylinder on the top this part get hot this part be cool and electricity come out the exact converse be also true if you put electricity in this will get hot and this will get cold you get refrigeration so it be a complete reversible cycle a very efficient cycle and quite a simple thing to make so now you put the two thing together so you have the engine what if you combine the petal and the engine in the center the petal track and the engine get the concentrated sunlight take that heat and turn it into electricity this be what the first prototype of we system look like with the petal and the engine in the center this be be run out in the sun and now I want to show you what the actual thing look like applause thank you so this be a unit with the 12 petal this petal cost about a dollar each they be lightweight injection mold plastic aluminize the mechanism to control each petal be below there with a microprocessor on each one there be thermocouple on the engine little sensor that detect the heat when the sunlight strike they each petal adjust itself separately to keep the high temperature on it when the sun come out in the morning the petal will seek the sun find it by search for the high temperature about a minute and a half or two minute after the ray be strike the hot cap the engine will be warm enough to start and then the engine will generate electricity for about six and a half hour a day six and a half to seven hour as the sun move across the sky a critical part that we can take advantage of be that we have this inexpensive microprocessor and each of this petal be autonomous and each of this petal figure out where the sun be with no user setup so you do not have to tell what latitude longitude you be at what you roof slope angle be or what orientation it do not really care what it do be it search to find the hot spot it search again a half a hour later a day later a month later it basically figure out where on Earth you be by watch the direction the sun move so you do not have to actually enter anything about that the way the unit work be when the sun come out the engine will start and you get power out here we have ac and DC get 12 volt DC so that could be use for certain application we have a inverter in there so you get 117 volt ac and you also get hot water the hot water optional you do not have to use it it will cool itself but you can use it to optionally heat hot water and that bring the efficiency up even high because some of the heat that you have normally be reject you can now use as useful energy whether it be for a pool or hot water let I show you a quick movie of what this look like run this be the first test where we take it outside and each of the petal be individually seek and what they do be step very coarsely at first and very finely afterward once they get a temperature read on the thermocouple indicate they find the sun they slow down and do a fine search then the petal will move into position and the engine will start we have be work on this for the last two year we be very excited about the progress we have a long way to go though this be how we envision it would be in a residential installation you would probably have more than one unit on you roof it could be on you roof you backyard or somewhere else you do not have to have enough unit to power you entire house you just save money with each incremental one you add so you be still use the grid potentially in this type of application to be you backup supply of course you can not use this at night and you can not use this on cloudy day but by reduce you energy use pretty much at the peak time usually when you have you air conditioning on or other time like that this generate the peak power at the peak usage time so it be very complementary in that sense this be how we would envision a residential application we also think there be very big potential for energy farm especially in remote land where there happen to be a lot of sun it be a really good combination of that two factor it turn out there be a lot of powerful sun all around the world obviously but in special place where it happen to be relatively inexpensive to place this and also in many more place where there be high wind power so a example of that be here be the map of the United States pretty much everywhere that be not green or blue be a really ideal place but even the green or blue area be good just not as good as the place that be red orange and yellow but the hot spot right around Las Vegas and Death Valley be very good and be only affect the payback period it do not mean that you could not use solar energy you could use it anywhere on Earth it just affect the payback period if you be compare to grid supply electricity but if you do not have grid supply electricity then the question of payback be a different one entirely it be just how many watt do you get per dollar and how could you benefit from that to change you life in some way this be the map of the whole Earth and you can see a huge swathe in the middle where a large part of the population be there be tremendous chance for solar energy and of course look at Africa the potential to take advantage of solar energy there be unbelievable and I be really excited to talk more about find way we can help with that so in conclusion I would say my journey have show I that you can revisit old idea in a new light and sometimes idea that have be discard in the past can be practical now if you apply some new technology or new twist we believe we be get very close to something practical and affordable we short term goal for this be to be half the price of solar cell and we long term goal be to be less than a five year payback and at less than a five year payback this become very economic so you do not have to just have a feel good attitude about energy to want to have one of this it just make economic sense right now solar payback be between 30 and 50 year if you get it down below five year then it be almost a no brainer because the interest to own it someone else will finance it for you and you can just make money from day one so that be we real powerful goal that we be really shoot for in the company two other thing that I learn that be very surprising to I one be how casual we be about energy I be walk from the elevator over here and even just look at the stage right now so there be probably 20 500 watt light right now there be 10 000 watt of light pour on the stage one horsepower be 746 watt at full power so there be basically 15 horse run at full speed just to keep the stage light not to mention the 200 horse that be probably run right now to keep the air conditioning go and it be just amazing walk in the elevator and there be light on in the elevator of course now I be very sensitive at home when we leave the light on by mistake but everywhere around we we have insatiable use for energy because it be so cheap and it be cheap because we have be subsidize by energy that be be concentrate by the sun basically oil be solar energy concentrate it be be pound for a billion year with a lot of energy to make it have all that energy contain in it and we do not have a birthright to just use that up as fast as we be I think and it would be great if we could make we energy usage renewable where as we be use the energy we be create it at the same pace and I really hope we can get there thank you very much you have be a great audience
