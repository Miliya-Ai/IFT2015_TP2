I be a medical illustrator and I come from a slightly different point of view I have be watch since I grow up the expression of truth and beauty in the art and truth and beauty in the science and while this be both wonderful thing in they own right they both have very wonderful thing go for they truth and beauty as ideal that can be look at by the science and by math be almost like the ideal conjoined twin that a scientist would want to date laughter this be expression of truth as awe full thing by mean they be thing you can worship they be ideal that be powerful they be irreducible they be unique they be useful sometimes often a long time after the fact and you can actually roll some of the picture now because I do not want to look at I on the screen truth and beauty be thing that be often opaque to person who be not in the science they be thing that describe beauty in a way that be often only accessible if you understand the language and the syntax of the person who study the subject in which truth and beauty be express if you look at the math e mc square if you look at the cosmological constant where there be a anthropic ideal where you see that life have to evolve from the number that describe the universe this be thing that be really difficult to understand and what I have try to do since I have my training as a medical illustrator since I be teach animation by my father who be a sculptor and my visual mentor I want to figure out a way to help person understand truth and beauty in the biological science by use animation by use picture by tell story so that the thing that be not necessarily evident to person can be bring forth and can be teach and can be understand student today be often immerse in a environment where what they learn be subject that have truth and beauty embed in they but the way they be teach be compartmentalize and it be draw down to the point where the truth and beauty be not always evident it be almost like that old recipe for chicken soup where you boil the chicken until the flavor be just go we do not want to do that to we student so we have a opportunity to really open up education and I have a telephone call from Robert Lue at Harvard in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Department a couple of year ago he ask I if my team and I would be interested and willing to really change how medical and scientific education be do at Harvard so we embark on a project that would explore the cell that would explore the truth and beauty inherent in molecular and cellular biology so that student could understand a large picture that they could hang all of this fact on they could have a mental image of the cell as a large bustling hugely complicated city that be occupy by micro machine and this micro machine really be at the heart of life this micro machine which be the envy of nanotechnologist the world over be self direct powerful precise accurate device that be make out of string of amino acid and this micro machine power how a cell move they power how a cell replicate they power we heart they power we mind and so what we want to do be to figure out how we could make this story into a animation that would be the centerpiece of BioVisions at Harvard which be a website that Harvard have for its molecular and cellular biology student that will in addition to all the textual information in addition to all the didactic stuff put everything together visually so that this student would have a internalize view of what a cell really be in all of its truth and beauty and be able to study with this view in mind so that they imagination would be spark so that they passion would be spark and so that they would be able to go on and use this vision in they head to make new discovery and to be able to find out really how life work so we set out by look at how this molecule be put together we work with a theme which be you have get macrophage that be stream down a capillary and they be touch the surface of the capillary wall and they be pick up information from cell that be on the capillary wall and they be give this information that there be a inflammation somewhere outside where they can not see and sense but they get the information that cause they to stop cause they to internalize that they need to make all of the various part that will cause they to change they shape and try to get out of this capillary and find out what be go on so this molecular motor we have to work with the Harvard scientist and databank model of the atomically accurate molecule and figure out how they move and figure out what they do and figure out how to do this in a way that be truthful in that it impart what be go on but not so truthful that the compact crowd in a cell would prevent the vista from happen and so what I be go to show you be a three minute reader Digest version of the first aspect of this film that we produce it be a ongoing project that be go to go another four or five year and I want you to look at this and see the path that the cell manufacture this little walk machine they be call kinesin that take this huge load that would challenge a ant in relative size run the movie please but this machine that power the inside of the cell be really quite amazing and they really be the basis of all life because all of this machine interact with each other they pass information to each other they cause different thing to happen inside the cell and the cell will actually manufacture the part that it need on the fly from information that be bring from the nucleus by molecule that read the gene no life from the small life to everybody here would be possible without this little micro machine in fact it would really in the absence of this machine have make the attendance here Chris really quite sparse laughter music this be the fedex delivery guy of the cell this little guy be call the kinesin and he pull a sack that be full of brand new manufacture proteins to wherever it be need in the cell whether it be to a membrane whether it be to a organelle whether it be to build something or repair something and each of we have about 100 000 of this thing run around right now inside each one of you 100 trillion cell so no matter how lazy you feel you be not really intrinsically do nothing laughter so what I want you to do when you go home be think about this and think about how powerful we cell be and think about some of the thing that we be learn about cellular mechanic once we figure out all that be go on and believe I we know almost a percent of what be go on once we figure out what be go on we be really go to be able to have a lot of control over what we do with we health with what we do with future generation and how long we be go to live and hopefully we will be able to use this to discover more truth and more beauty music but it be really quite amazing that this cell this micro machine be aware enough of what the cell need that they do they bid they work together they make the cell do what it need to do and they work together help we body huge entity that they will never see function properly enjoy the rest of the show thank you applause
