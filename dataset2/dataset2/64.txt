as someone who have spend he entire career try to be invisiblestand in front of a audience be a cross between a out of body experience and a deer catch in the headlight so please forgive I for violate one of the TED commandment by rely on word on paper and I only hope I be not strike by lightning bolt before I be do I would like to begin by talk about some of the idea that motivate I to become a documentary photographer I be a student in the 60 a time of social upheaval and questioning and on a personal level a awakening sense of idealism the war in Vietnam be rage the Civil Rights Movement be under way and picture have a powerful influence on I we political and military leader be tell we one thing and photographer be tell we another I believe the photographer and so do million of other American they image fuel resistance to the war and to racism they not only record history they help change the course of history they picture become part of we collective consciousness and as consciousness evolve into a share sense of conscience change become not only possible but inevitable I see that the free flow of information represent by journalism specifically visual journalism can bring into focus both the benefit and the cost of political policy it can give credit to sound decision make add momentum to success in the face of poor political judgment or political inaction it become a kind of intervention assess the damage and ask we to reassess we behavior it put a human face on issue which from afar can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in they global impact what happen at ground level far from the hall of power happen to ordinary citizen one by one and I understand that documentary photography have the ability to interpret event from they point of view it give a voice to that who otherwise would not have a voice and as a reaction it stimulate public opinion and give impetus to public debate thereby prevent the interested party from totally control the agenda much as they would like to come of age in that day make real the concept that the free flow of information be absolutely vital for a free and dynamic society to function properly the press be certainly a business and in order to survive it must be a successful business but the right balance must be find between marketing consideration and journalistic responsibility Society problem can not be solve until they be identify on a high plane the press be a service industry and the service it provide be awareness every story do not have to sell something there be also a time to give that be a tradition I want to follow see the war create such incredibly high stake for everyone involve and that visual journalism could actually become a factor in conflict resolution I want to be a photographer in order to be a war photographer but I be drive by a inherent sense that a picture that reveal the true face of war would almost by definition be a anti war photograph I would like to take you on a visual journey through some of the event and issue I have be involve in over the past 25 year in 1981 I go to Northern Ireland 10 IRA prisoner be in the process of starve themselves to death in protest against condition in jail the reaction on the street be violent confrontation I see that the front line of contemporary war be not on isolate battlefield but right where person live during the early 80 I spend a lot of time in Central America which be engulf by civil war that straddle the ideological divide of the Cold War in Guatemala the central government control by a oligarchy of European decent be wage a scorch Earth campaign against a indigenous rebellion and I see a image that reflect the history of Latin America conquest through a combination of the Bible and the sword a anti Sandinista guerrilla be mortally wound as Commander Zero attack a town in Southern Nicaragua A destroy tank belong to Somoza national guard be leave as a monument in a park in Managua and be transform by the energy and spirit of a child at the same time a civil war be take place in El Salvador and again the civilian population be catch up in the conflict I have be cover the Palestinian Israeli conflict since 1981 this be a moment from the beginning of the second intifada in 2000 when it be still stone and molotov against a army in 2001 the uprising escalate into a armed conflict and one of the major incident be the destruction of the Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank town of Jenin without the political will to find common ground the continual friction of tactic and counter tactic only create suspicion and hatred and vengeance and perpetuate the cycle of violence in the 90 after the breakup of the Soviet Union Yugoslavia fracture along ethnic fault line and civil war break out between Bosnia Croatia and Serbia this be a scene of house to house fighting in Mostar neighbor against neighbor a bedroom the place where person share intimacy where life itself be conceive become a battlefield a mosque in northern Bosnia be destroy by serbian artillery and be use as a makeshift morgue Dead serbian soldier be collect after a battle and use as barter for the return of prisoner or bosnian soldier kill in action this be once a park the bosnian soldier who guide I tell I that all of he friend be there now at the same time in South Africa after Nelson Mandela have be release from prison the black population commence the final phase of liberation from apartheid one of the thing I have to learn as a journalist be what to do with my anger I have to use it channel its energy turn it into something that would clarify my vision instead of clouding it in Transkei I witness a rite of passage into manhood of the Xhosa tribe teenage boy live in isolation they body cover with white clay after several week they wash off the white and take on the full responsibility of man it be a very old ritual that seem symbolic of the political struggle that be change the face of South Africa Children in Soweto play on a trampoline elsewhere in Africa there be famine in Somalia the central government collapse and clan warfare break out Farmers be drive off they land and crop and livestock be destroy or steal starvation be be use as a weapon of mass destruction primitive but extremely effective hundred of thousand of person be exterminate slowly and painfully the international community respond with massive humanitarian relief and hundred of thousand of more life be save American troops be send to protect the relief shipment but they be eventually draw into the conflict and after the tragic battle in Mogadishu they be withdraw in southern Sudan another civil war see similar use of starvation as a means of genocide again international NGOs unite under the umbrella of the U N stage a massive relief operation and thousand of life be save I be a witness and I want my testimony to be honest and uncensored I also want it to be powerful and eloquent and to do as much justice as possible to the experience of the person I be photograph this man be in a NGO feeding center be help as much as he could be help he literally have nothing he be a virtual skeleton yet he could still summon the courage and the will to move he have not give up and if he do not give up how could anyone in the outside world ever dream of lose hope in 1994 after three month of cover the south African election I see the inauguration of Nelson Mandela and it be the most uplifting thing I have ever see it exemplify the good that humanity have to offer the next day I leave for Rwanda and it be like take the express elevator to hell this man have just be liberate from a Hutu death camp he allow I to photograph he for quite a long time and he even turn he face toward the light as if he want I to see he well I think he know what the scar on he face would say to the rest of the world this time maybe confused or discourage by the military disaster in Somalia the international community remain silent and somewhere around 800 000 person be slaughter by they own countryman sometimes they own neighbor use farm implement as weapon perhaps because a lesson have be learn by the weak response to the war in Bosnia and the failure in Rwanda when Serbia attack Kosovo international action be take much more decisively NATO force go in and the serbian army withdraw ethnic Albanian have be murder they farm destroy and a huge number of person forcibly deport they be receive in refugee camp set up by NGOs in Albania and Macedonia the imprint
