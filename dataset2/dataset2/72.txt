when I be start talk like this I usually do a whole spiel about sustainability because a lot of person out there do not know what that be this be a crowd that do know what it be so I will like just do like the 60 second crib note version right so just bear with I we will go real fast you know fill in the blank so you know sustainability small planet right picture a little Earth circle around the sun you know about a million year ago a bunch of monkey fall out of tree get a little clever harnessed fire invent the printing press make you know luggage with wheel on it and you know build the society that we now live in unfortunately while this society be without a doubt the most prosperous and dynamic the world have ever create it be get some major major flaw one of they be that every society have a ecological footprint it have a amount of impact on the planet that be measurable how much stuff go through you life how much waste be leave behind you and we at the moment in we society have a really dramatically unsustainable level of this we be use up about five planet if everybody on the planet live the way we do we would need between five six seven some person even say 10 planet to make it clearly we do not have 10 planet again you know mental visual 10 planet one planet 10 planet one planet right we do not have that so that be one problem the second problem be that the planet that we have be be use in wildly unfair way right north American such as myself you know we be basically sort of wallow gluttonous hog and we be eat all sort of stuff and you know then you get all the way down to person who live in the Asia Pacific region or even more Africa and person simply do not have enough to survive this be produce all sort of tension all sort of dynamics that be deeply disturbing and there be more and more person on the way right so this be what the planet be go to look like in 20 year it be go to be a pretty crowded place at least eight billion person so to make matter even more difficult it be a very young planet a third of the person on this planet be kid and that kid be grow up in a completely different way than they parent do no matter where they live they have be expose to this idea of we society of we prosperity and they may not want to live exactly like we they may not want to be American or Brits or German or south African but they want they own version of a life which be more prosperous and more dynamic and more you know enjoyable and all of this thing combine to create a enormous amount of torque on the planet and if we can not figure out a way to deal with that torque we be go to find ourselves more and more and more quickly face situation which be simply unthinkable everybody in this room have hear the bad case scenario I do not need to go into that but I will ask the question what be the alternative and I would say that at the moment the alternative be unimaginable you know so on the one hand we have the unthinkable on the other hand we have the unimaginable we do not know yet how to build a society which be environmentally sustainable which be shareable with everybody on the planet which promote stability and democracy and human right and which be achievable in the time frame necessary to make it through the challenge we face we do not know how to do this yet so what be Worldchanging Well Worldchanging you might think of as be a bit of a news service for the unimaginable future you know what we be out there do be look for example of tool model and idea which if widely adopt would change the game a lot of time when I do a talk like this I talk about thing that everybody in this room I be sure have already hear of but most person have not so I think today I would do something a little different and talk about what we be look for rather than say you know rather than give you try and true example talk about the kind of thing we be scop out give you a little peek into we editorial notebook and give that I have 13 minute to do this this be go to go kind of quick so I do not know just stick with I right so first of all what be we look for Bright Green city one of the big lever that we have in the developed world for change the impact that we have on the planet be change the way that we live in city we be already a urban planet that be especially true in the developed world and person who live in city in the developed world tend to be very prosperous and thus use a lot of stuff if we can change the dynamic by first of all create city that be dense and more livable here for example be Vancouver which if you have not be there you ought to go for a visit it be a fabulous city and they be do density new density good than probably anybody else on the planet right now they be actually manage to talk north American out of drive car which be a pretty great thing so you have density you also have growth management you leave aside what be natural to be natural this be in Portland that be a actual development that land there will remain pasture in perpetuity they have bind the city with a line Nature city nothing change once you do that thing you can start make all sort of investment you can start do thing like you know transit system that actually work to transport person in effective and reasonably comfortable manners you can also start to change what you build this be the Beddington Zero Energy Development in London which be one of the green building in the world it be a fabulous place we be able to now build building that generate all they own electricity that recycle much of they water that be much more comfortable than standard building use all natural light etc and over time cost less green roof Bill McDonough cover that last night so I will not dwell on that too much but once you also have person live in close proximity to each other one of the thing you can do be as information technology develop you can start to have smart place you can start to know where thing be when you know where thing be it become easy to share they when you share they you end up use less so one great example be car share club which be really start to take off in the U S have already take off in many place in Europe and be a great example if you be somebody who drive you know one day a week do you really need you own car another thing that information technology let we do be start figure out how to use less stuff by know and by monitor the amount we be actually use so here be a power cord which glow bright the more energy that you use which I think be a pretty cool concept although I think it ought to work the other way around that it get bright the more you do not use but you know there may even be a simple approach we could just re label thing this light switch that read on the one hand flashflood and on the other hand off how we build thing can change as well this be a bio morphic building it take its inspiration in form from life many of this building be incredibly beautiful and also much more effective this be a example of bio mimicry which be something we be really start to look a lot more for in this case you have a shell design which be use to create a new kind of exhaust fan which be greatly more effective there be a lot of this stuff happen it be really pretty remarkable I encourage you to look on Worldchanging if you be into it we be start to cover this more and more there be also neo biological design where more and more we be actually use life itself and the process of life to become part of we industry so this for example be hydrogen generate algae so we have a model in potential a emerge model that we be look for of how to take the city most of we live in and turn they into Bright Green city but unfortunately most of the person on the planet do not live in the cite we live in they live in the emerge megacity of the develop world and there be a statistic I often like to use which be that we be add a city of Seattle every four day a city the size of Seattle to the planet every four day I be give a talk about two month ago and this guy who have do some work with the U N come up to I and be really flustered and he say look you have get that totally wrong it be totally wrong it be every seven day so we be add a city the size of Seattle every seven day and most of that city look more like this than the city that you or I live in most of that cite be grow incredibly quickly they do not have exist infrastructure they have enormous number of person who be struggle with poverty and enormous number of person be try to figure out how to do thing in new way so what do we need in order to make develop nation megacity into Bright Green megacity well the first thing we need be we need leapfrog and this be one of the thing that we be look for everywhere the idea behind leapfrogging be that if you be a person or a country who be stick in a situation where you do not have the tool and technology that you need there be no reason for you to invest in last generation technology right that you be much good off almost universally look for a low cost or locally applicable version of the new technology one place we be all familiar with see this be with cell phone right all throughout the develop world person be go directly to cell phone skip the whole landline stage if there be landline in many develop world city they be usually pretty crappy system that break down a lot and cost enormous amount of money so I rather like this picture here I particularly like the Ganesh in the background talk on the cell phone so what we have increasingly be cell phone just permeate out through society we have hear all about this here this week so I will not say too much more than that other than to say what be true for cell phone be true for all sort of technology the second thing be tool for collaboration be they system of collaboration or intellectual property system which encourage collaboration right when you have free ability for person to freely work together and innovate you get different kind of solution and that solution be accessible in a different way to person who do not have capital right so you know we have open source software we have creative Commons and other kind of Copyleft solution and that thing lead to thing like this this be a Telecentro in Sao Paulo this be a pretty remarkable program use free and open source software cheap sort of hack together machine and basically sort of abandon building have put together a bunch of community center where person can come in get high speed internet access learn computer programming skill for free and a quarter million person every year use this now in Sao Paulo and that quarter million person be some of the poor person in Sao Paolo I particularly like the little Linux penguin in the back laughter so one of the thing that that be lead to be a sort of southern cultural explosion and one of the thing we be really really interested in at worldchanging be the way in which the south be re identify itself and be categorize itself in way that have less and less to do with most of we in this room so it be not you know Bollywood be not just answer Hollywood Right you know Brazilian music scene be not just answer the major label it be do something new there be new thing happen there be interplay between they and you know you get amazing thing like I do not know if any of you have see the movie city of God yeah it be a fabulous movie if you have not see it and it be all about this question in a very artistic and indirect kind of way you have other radical example where the ability to use cultural tool be spread out this be person who have just be visit by the internet bookmobile in Uganda and who be wave they first book in the air which I just think that be a pretty cool picture you know so you also have the ability for person to start come together and act on they own behalf in political and civic way in way that have not happen before and as we hear last night as we have hear early this week be absolutely fundamentally vital to the ability to craft new solution be we have get to craft new political reality and I would personally say that we have to craft new political reality not only in place like India Afghanistan Kenya Pakistan what have you but here at home as well another world be possible and sort of the big motto of the anti globalization movement right we tweak that a lot we talk about how another world be not just possible another world here that it be not just that we have to sort of imagine there be a different vague possibility out there but we need to start act a little bit more on that possibility we need to start do thing like Lula President of Brazil how many person know of Lula before today ok so much much good than the average crowd I can tell you that so Lula he be full of problem full of contradiction but one of the thing that he be do be he be put forward a idea of how we engage in international relation that completely shift the balance from the standard sort of north south dialogue into a whole new way of global collaboration I would keep you eye on this fellow another example of this sort of second superpower thing be the rise of this game that be what we call serious play we be look a lot at this this be spread everywhere this be from a force more powerful it be a little screenshot A Force more powerful be a video game that while you be play it it teach you how to engage in non violent insurrection and regime change laughter here be another one this be from a game call Food Force which be a game that teach child how to run a refugee camp this thing be all contribute in a very dynamic way to a huge rise in especially in the develop world in person interest in and passion for democracy we get so little news about the develop world that we often forget that there be literally million of person out there struggle to change thing to be fair free more democratic less corrupt and you know we do not hear that story enough but it be happen all over the place and this tool be part of what be make it possible now when you add all that thing together when you add together leapfrog and new kind of tool you know second superpower stuff etc what do you get well very quickly you get a Bright Green future for the develop world you get for example green power spread throughout the world you get this be a building in Hyderabad India it be the green building in the world you get grassroots solution thing that work for person who have no capital or limited access you get barefoot solar engineer carry solar panel into the remote mountain you get access to distance medicine this be Indian nurse learn how to use pda to access database that have information that they do not have access to at home in a distant manner you get new tool for person in the develop world this be lead light that help the roughly billion person out there for whom nightfall mean darkness to have a new means of operate this be refrigerator that require no electricity they be pot within a pot design and you get water solution water one of the most pressing problem here be a design for harvesting rainwater that be super cheap and available to person in the develop world here be a design for distil water use sunlight here be a fog catcher which if you live in a moist jungle like area will distill water from the air that be clean and drinkable here be a way of transport water I just love this you know I mean carry water be such a drag and somebody just come up with the idea of well what if you roll it right I mean that be a great design this be a fabulous invention LifeStraw basically you can suck any water through this and it will become drinkable by the time it hit you lip so you know person who be in desperate strait can get this this be one of my favorite worldchanging kind of thing ever this be a merry go round invent by the company Roundabout which pump water as kid play you know seriously give that one a hand it be pretty great and the same thing be true for person who be in absolute crisis right we be expect to have upwards of 200 million refugee by the year 2020 because of climate change and political instability how do we help person like that well there be all sort of amazing new humanitarian design that be be develop in collaborative way all across the planet some of that design include model for act such as new model for village instruction in the middle of refugee camp new model for pedagogy for the displace and we have new tool this be one of my absolute favorite thing anywhere do anyone know what this be audience it detect landmine Alex Steffen exactly this be a landmine detect flower if you be live in one of the place where the roughly half billion unaccounted for mine be scatter you can fling this seed out into the field and as they grow up they will grow up around the mine they root will detect the chemical in they and where the flower turn red you do not step yeah so seed that could save you life you know applause I also love it because it seem to I that the example the tool we use to change the world ought to be beautiful in themselves you know that it be not just enough to survive we have get to make something good than what we have get and I think that we will just to wrap up in the immortal word of h g Wells I think that good thing be on the way I think that in fact that all of the past be but the beginning of a begin all that the human mind have accomplish be but the dream before the awakening I hope that that turn out to be true the person in this room have give I more confidence than ever that it will thank you very much applause
