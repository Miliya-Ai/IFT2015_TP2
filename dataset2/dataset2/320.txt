I be speak about compassion from a Islamic point of view and perhaps my faith be not very well think of as be one that be grind in compassion the truth of the matter be otherwise we holy book the Koran consist of 114 chapter and each chapter begin with what we call the basmala the saying of in the name of God the all compassionate the all merciful or as Sir Richard Burton not the Richard Burton who be marry to Elizabeth Taylor but the Sir Richard Burton who live a century before that and who be a worldwide traveler and translator of many work of literature translate it in the name of God the compassionate the compassionate and in a saying of the Koran which to Muslim be God speak to humanity God say to he prophet Muhammad whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophet begin with Adam include Noah include Moses include Abraham include Jesus Christ and end with Muhammad that we have not send you o Muhammad except as a rahmah except as a source of compassion to humanity for we human being and certainly for we as Muslim whose mission and whose purpose in follow the path of the prophet be to make ourselves as much like the prophet and the prophet in one of he say say Adorn yourselve with the attribute of God and because God himself say that the primary attribute of he be compassion in fact the Koran say that God decree upon himself compassion or reign himself in by compassion therefore we objective and we mission must be to be source of compassion activator of compassion actor of compassion and speaker of compassion and doer of compassion that be all well and good but where do we go wrong and what be the source of the lack of compassion in the world for the answer to this we turn to we spiritual path in every religious tradition there be the outer path and the inner path or the exoteric path and the esoteric path the esoteric path of Islam be more popularly know as sufism or tasawwuf in Arabic and this doctor or this master this spiritual master of the sufi tradition refer to teaching and example of we prophet that teach we where the source of we problem lie in one of the battle that the prophet wage he tell he follower we be return from the less war to the great war to the great battle and they say Messenger of God we be battle weary how can we go to a great battle he say that be the battle of the self the battle of the ego the source of human problem have to do with egotism I the famous sufi master Rumi who be very well know to most of you have a story in which he talk of a man who go to the house of a friend and he knock on the door and a voice answer who be there it be I or more grammatically correctly it be I as we might say in English the voice say go away after many year of training of discipline of search and struggle he come back with much great humility he knock again on the door the voice ask who be there he say it be you o heartbreaker the door swing open and the voice say come in for there be no room in this house for two I be two capital I be not this eye for two ego and Rumi story be metaphor for the spiritual path in the presence of God there be no room for more than one I and that be the i of divinity in a teaching call a hadith qudsi in we tradition God say that my servant or my creature my human creature do not approach I by anything that be dear to I than what I have ask they to do and that of you who be employer know exactly what I mean you want you employee to do what you ask they to do and if they have do that then they can do extra but do not ignore what you have ask they to do and God say my servant continue to get nearer to I by do more of what I have ask they to do extra credit we might call it until I love he or love she and when I love my servant God say I become the eye by which he or she see the ear by which he or she listen the hand by which he or she grasp and the foot by which he or she walk and the heart by which he or she understand it be this merging of we self with divinity that be the lesson and purpose of we spiritual path and all of we faith tradition Muslim regard Jesus as the master of Sufism the great prophet and messenger who come to emphasize the spiritual path when he say I be the spirit and I be the way and when the prophet Muhammad say whoever have see I have see God it be because they become so much a instrument of God they become part of God team so that God will be manifest through they and they be not act from they own self and they own ego Compassion on earth be give it be in we all we have to do be to get we ego out of the way get we egotism out of the way I be sure probably all of you here or certainly the very vast majority of you have have what you might call a spiritual experience a moment in you life when for a few second a minute perhaps the boundary of you ego dissolve and at that minute you feel at one with the universe one with that jug of water one with every human be one with the Creator and you feel you be in the presence of power of awe of the deep love the deep sense of compassion and mercy that you have ever experience in you life that be a moment which be a gift of God to we a gift when for a moment he lift that boundary which make we insist on I I I I I I and instead like the person in Rumi story we say oh this be all you this be all you and this be all we and we and I and we be all part of you o creator o the Objective the source of we be and the end of we journey you be also the breaker of we heart you be the one whom we should all be towards for whose purpose we live and for whose purpose we shall die and for whose purpose we shall be resurrect again to account to God to what extent we have be compassionate be we message today and we purpose today and that of you who be here today and the purpose of this charter of compassion be to remind for the Koran always urge we to remember to remind each other because the knowledge of truth be within every human be we know it all we have access to it all Jung may have call it the subconscious through we subconscious in you dream the Koran call we state of sleep the less death the temporary death in we state of sleep we have dream we have vision we travel even outside of we body for many of we and we see wonderful thing we travel beyond the limitation of space as we know it and beyond the limitation of time as we know it but all this be for we to glorify the name of the creator whose primary name be the compassionate the compassionate God Bokh whatever name you want to call he with Allah Ram Om whatever the name might be through which you name or access the presence of divinity it be the locus of absolute be absolute love and mercy and compassion and absolute knowledge and wisdom what Hindus call satchidananda the language differ but the objective be the same Rumi have another story about three man a Turk a Arab and and I forget the third person but for my sake it could be a malay one be ask for angur one be say a Englishman one be ask for eneb and one be ask for grape and they have a fight and a argument because I want grape I want eneb I want angur not know that the word that they be use refer to the same reality in different language there be only one absolute reality by definition one absolute being by definition because absolute be by definition single and absolute and singular there be this absolute concentration of be the absolute concentration of consciousness awareness a absolute locus of compassion and love that define the primary attribute of divinity and this should also be the primary attribute of what it mean to be human for what define humanity perhaps biologically be we physiology but God define humanity by we spirituality by we nature and the Koran say he speak to the angel and say when I have finish the formation of Adam from clay and breathe into he of my spirit then fall in prostration to he the angel prostrate not before the human body but before the human soul why because the soul the human soul embody a piece of the divine breath a piece of the divine soul this be also express in biblical vocabulary when we be teach that we be create in the divine image what be the imagery of God the imagery of God be absolute be absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom and absolute compassion and love and therefore for we to be human in the great sense of what it mean to be human in the most joyful sense of what it mean to be human means that we too have to be proper steward of the breath of divinity within we and seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of be of be alive of beingness the attribute of wisdom of consciousness of awareness and the attribute of be compassionate and love be this be what I understand from my faith tradition and this be what I understand from my study of other faith tradition and this be the common platform on which we must all stand and when we stand on this platform as such I be convince that we can make a wonderful world and I believe personally that we be on the verge and that with the presence and help of person like you here we can bring about the prophecy of Isaiah for he foretell of a period when person shall transform they sword into plowshare and will not learn war or make war anymore we have reach a stage in human history that we have no option we must we must lower we ego control we ego whether it be individual ego personal ego family ego national ego and let all be for the glorification of the one thank you and God bless you applause
