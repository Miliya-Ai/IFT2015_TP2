what I be always think about be what this session be about which be call simplicity and almost I would almost call it be simple minded but in the good sense of the word I be try to figure out two very simple thing how to live and how to die period that be all I be try to do all day long and I be also try to have some meal and have some snack and you know and yell at my child and do all the normal thing that keep you ground so I be fortunate enough to be bear a very dreamy child my old sister be busy torture my parent and they be busy torture she I be lucky enough to be completely ignore which be a fabulous thing actually I want to tell you so I be able to completely daydream my way through my life and I finally daydream my way into NYU at a very good time in 1967 where I meet a man who be try to blow up the math building of NYU and I be write terrible poetry and knitting sweater for he and feminist hate we and the whole thing be wretched from begin to end but I keep write bad poetry and he do not blow up the math building but he go to Cuba but I give he the money because I be from Riverdale so I have more money than he do laughter and that be a good thing to help you know the cause but then he come back and thing happen and I decide I really hate my writing that it be awful awful purple prose and I decide that I want to tell but I still want to tell a narrative story and I still want to tell my story so I decide that I would start to draw how hard could that be and so what happen be that I start just become a editorial illustrator through you know sheer whatever sheer ignorance and we start a studio well Tibor really start the studio call M Co and the premise of M Co be we do not know anything but that be all right we be go to do it anyway and as a matter of fact it be good not to know anything because if you know too much you be stymied so the premise in the studio be there be no boundary there be no fear and I and my full time job I land the good job on Earth be to daydream and to actually come up with absurd idea that fortunately there be enough person there and it be a team it be a collective it be not just I come up with crazy idea but the point be that I be there as myself as a dreamer and so some of the thing I mean it be a long history of M Co and clearly we also need to make some money so we decide we would create a series of product and some of the watch there attempt to be beautiful and humorous maybe not attempt hopefully succeed that to be able to talk about content to break apart what you normally expect to use humor and surprise elegance and humanity in you work be really important to we it be a very high it be a very impersonal time in design and we want to say the content be what be important not the package not the wrapping you really have to be journalist you have to be inventor you have to use you imagination more importantly than anything so the good news be that I have a dog and though I do not know if I believe in luck I do not know what I believe in it be a very complicated question but I do know that before I go away I crank he tail seven time so whenever he see a suitcase in the house because everybody always you know leave they be always crank this wonderful dog tail and he run to the other room but I be able to make the transition from work for child and from work for adult to child and back and forth because you know I can say that I be immature and in a way that be true I do not really I mean I could tell you that I do not understand I be not proud of it but I do not understand let say 95 percent of the talk at this conference but I have be take beautiful note of drawing and I have a gorgeous onion from Murray Gell Mann talk and I have a beautiful page of doodle from Jonathan Woodham talk so good thing come out of you know incomprehension laughter which I will do a painting of and then it will end up in my work so I be open to the possibility of not know and find out something new so in write for child it seem simple and it be you have to condense a story into 32 page usually and what you have to do be you really have to edit down to what you want to say and hopefully you be not talk down to kid and you be not talk in such a way that you you know could not stand read it after one time so I hopefully be write you know book that be good for child and for adult but the painting reflect I do not think differently for child than I do for adult I try to use the same kind of imagination the same kind of whimsy the same kind of love of language so you know and I have lot of wonderful look friend this be Andrew Gatz and he walk in through the door and I say you sit down there you know I take lot of photo and the Bertoia chair in the background be my favorite chair so I get to put in all of the thing that I love hopefully a dialog between adult and child will happen on many different level and hopefully different kind of humor will evolve and the book be really journal of my life I never I do not like plot I do not know what a plot mean I can not stand the idea of anything that start in the beginning you know begin middle and end it really scare I because my life be too random and too confused and I enjoy it that way but anyway so we be in Venice and this be we room and I have this dream that I be wear this fantastic green gown and I be look out the window and it be really a beautiful thing and so I be able to put that into this story which be a alphabet and hopefully go on to something else the letter C have other thing in it I be fortunate also to meet the man who be sit on the bed though I give he hair over here and he do not have hair well he have some hair but well he use to have hair and with he I be able to do a project that be really fantastic I work for the New Yorker and I do cover and 9 11 happen and it be you know a complete and utter end of the world as we know it and Rick and I be on we way to a party in the Bronx and somebody say Bronxistan and somebody say Ferreristan and we come up with this New Yorker cover which we be able to we do not know what we be do we be not try to be funny we be not try to be well we be try to be funny actually that be not true we hope we would be funny but we do not know it would be a cover and we do not know that that image at the moment that it happen would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of person and it really become the I do not know you know it be one of that moment person start laugh at what be go on and from you know Fattushis to Taxistan to you know for the Fashtoonks Botoxia Pashmina Khlintunisia you know we be able to take the city and make fun of this completely foreign who be what be go on over here who be this person what be this tribe and David Remnick who be really wonderful about it have one problem he do not like Al Zheimers because he think it would insult person with Alzheimer but you know we say David who be go to know they be not laughter so it stay in and it be and you know it be a good thing you know in the course of my life I never know what be go to happen and that be kind of the beauty part and we be on Cape Cod a place obviously of great inspiration and I pick up this book the element of style at a yard sale and I do not and I would never use it in school because I be too busy write poem and flunk out and I do not know what sit in cafe but I pick it up and I start read it and I think this book be amazing I say person should know about this book laughter so I decide it need a few it need a lift it need a few illustration and basically I call the you know I convince the White Estate and what a intersection of like you know Polish Jew you know main WASP family here I be say I would like to do something to this book and they say yes and they leave I completely alone which be a gorgeous wonderful thing and I take the example that they give and just do 56 painting basically so this be I do not know if you can read this well Susan this be a fine mess you be in and when you be deal with grammar which be you know incredibly dry e b White write such wonderful whimsical and actually Strunk and then you come to the rule and you know there be lot of grammar thing do you mind I ask a question do you mind my ask a question would could should or would should could and would be Coco Chanel lover should be Edith Sitwell and could be a August Sander subject and he notice a large stain in the center of the rug laughter so there be a kind of British understatement murder mystery theme that I really love very much and then be obscure clearly be wild of tongue in a way we can understand e b White write we a number of rule which can either paralyze you and make you loathe he for the rest of time or you can ignore they which I do or you can I do not know what you know eat a sandwich so what I do when I be paint be I start sing because I really adore singing and I think that music be the high form of all art so I commission a wonderful composer Nico Muhly who write nine song use the text and we perform this fantastic evening of he write music for both amateur and professional I play the clatter teacup and the slinky in the main reading room of the New York Public Library where you be suppose to be very very quiet and it be a phenomenally wonderful event which we hopefully will do some more who know the New York TimesSelect the op ed page ask I to do a column and they say you can do whatever you want so once a month for the last year I have be do a column call the principle of uncertainty which you know I do not know who Heisenberg be but I know I can throw that around now you know it be the principle of uncertainty so you know I be go to read quickly and probably I be go to edit some because I do not have that much time leave a few of the column and basically I be so you know it be so amusing because I say well how much space do I have and they say well you know it be the internet and I say yes but how much space do I have and they say it be unlimited it be unlimited ok so the first one I be very timid and I will begin how can I tell you everything that be in my heart impossible to begin enough no begin with the hapless dodo and I talk about the dodo and how the dodo become extinct and then I talk about Spinoza as the last dodo be die Spinoza be look for a rational explanation for everything call eudaemonia and then he breathe he last with love one around he and I know that he have chicken soup also as he last meal I happen to know it for a fact and then he die and there be no more Spinoza Extinct and then we do not have a stuff Spinoza but we do have a stuff Pavlov dog and I visit he in the Museum of Hygiene in St Petersburg in Russia and there he be with this horrible electrical box on he rump in this fantastic decrepit palace and I think it must have be a very very dark day when the Bolsheviks arrive maybe amongst themselves they have a few good laugh but Stalin be a paranoid man even more than my father laughter you do not even know and decide he top person have to be extinctify which I think I make up which be a good thing and so this be a chart of you know just a small chart because the chart would go on forever of all the person that he kill so shoot dead smack over the head you know throw away Nabokov family flee Russia how could the young Nabokov sit innocently and elegantly in a red chair leaf through a book and butterfly imagine such displacement such loss and then I want to tell you that this be a map so my beautiful mother family flee Russia as well too many pogrom leave the shack the wild blueberry wood the goose the River Sluch they go to Palestine and then America and my mother draw this map for I of the United States of America and that be my dna over here because that person who I grow up with have no use for fact whatsoever fact be actually banish from we home and so if you see that Texas you know Texas and California be under Canada and that South Carolina be on top of North Carolina this be the home that I grow up in ok so it be a miracle that I be here today but actually it be not it be actually a wonderful thing but then she say Tel Aviv and Lenin which be the town they come from and sorry the rest unknown thank you but in she lexicon sorry the rest unknown thank you be sorry the rest unknown go to hell because she could not care less laughter the impossibility of February be that February a really wretched month in New York and the image for I conjure up this really awful thing well not so awful I receive a box in the mail and it be wrap with newspaper and there be the picture of the man on the newspaper and he be dead and I say I hope he be not really dead just enjoy a refreshing lie down in the snow but the caption say he be dead and actually he be I think he be dead though I do not know maybe he be not dead and this woman lean over in anguish not about that man but about all sad thing it happen quite often in February there be console this man be angry because somebody throw onion all over the staircase and basically you know I guess onion be a theme here and he say it be impossible not to lie it be February and not lie be impossible and I really spend a lot of time wonder how much truth do we tell what be it that we be actually what story be we actually tell how do we know when we be ourselves how do we actually know that this sentence come out of we mouth be real story you know be real sentence or be they fake sentence that we think we ought to be say I be go to quickly go through this a quote by Bertrand Russell all the labor of all the age all the devotion all the inspiration all the noonday brightness of human genius be destine to extinction so now my friend if that be true and it be true what be the point a complicated question and so you know I talk to my friend and I go to play where they be sing Russian song oh my God you know what could we have no we do not have time I tape my aunt I tape my aunt sing a song in Russian from the you know could we have it for a second do you have that music ok I tape my my aunt use to swim in the ocean every day of the year until she be about 85 so and that be a song about how everybody be miserable because you know we be from Russia laughter I go to visit Kitty Carlisle Hart and she be 96 and when I bring she a copy of the element of style she say she would treasure it and then I say oh and she be talk about Moss Hart and I say when you meet he you know it be he and she say I know it be he laughter so I be the one who should have keep the book but it be a really wonderful moment and she date George Gershwin so you know get out Gershwin die at the age of 38 he be bury in the same cemetery as my husband I do not want to talk about that now I do want to talk the absolute icing on this cemetery cake be the Barricini family mausoleum nearby I think the Barricini family should open a store there and sell chocolate laughter and I would like to run it for they and I go to visit Louise Bourgeoise who be also still work and I look at she sink which be really amazing and left and then I photograph and do a painting of a sofa on the street and a woman who live on we street Lolita and then I go and have some tea and then my Aunt Frances die and before she die she try to pay with Sweet N Low packet for she bagel laughter and I wonder what the point be and then I know and I see that Hy Meyerowitz Rick Meyerowitz father a dry cleaning supply salesman from the Bronx win the Charlie Chaplin look alike contest in 1931 that be actually Hy and I look at a beautiful bowl of fruit and I look at a dress that I sew for friend of mine and it say Ich habe genug which be a Bach cantata which I once think mean I have have it I can not take it anymore give I a break but I be wrong it mean I have enough and that be utterly true I happen to be alive end of discussion thank you applause
