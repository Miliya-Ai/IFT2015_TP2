thank you very much Chris everybody who come up here say they be scared I do not know if I be scared but this be my first time of address a audience like this and I do not have any smart technology for you to look at there be no slide so you will just have to be content with I laughter what I want to do this morning be share with you a couple of story and talk about a different Africa already this morning there be some allusion to the Africa that you hear about all the time the Africa of HIV AIDS the Africa of malaria the Africa of poverty the Africa of conflict and the Africa of disaster while it be true that that thing be go on there be a Africa that you do not hear about very much and sometimes I be puzzled and I ask myself why this be the Africa that be change that Chris allude to this be the Africa of opportunity this be the Africa where person want to take charge of they own future and they own destiny and this be the Africa where person be look for partnership to do this that be what I want to talk about today and I want to start by tell you a story about that change in Africa on 15th of September 2005 Mr Diepreye Alamieyeseigha a governor of one of the oil rich state of Nigeria be arrest by the London Metropolitan Police on a visit to London he be arrest because there be transfer of eight million dollar that go into some dormant account that belong to he and he family this arrest occur because there be cooperation between the London Metropolitan Police and the economic and financial crime commission of Nigeria lead by one of we most able and courageous person Mr Nuhu Ribadu Alamieyeseigha be arraign in London due to some slip up he manage to escape dress as a woman and run from London back to Nigeria where accord to we constitution that in office as governor president as in many country have immunity and can not be prosecute but what happen person be so outraged by this behavior that it be possible for he state legislature to impeach he and get he out of office today alam as we call he for short be in jail this be a story about the fact that person in Africa be no long willing to tolerate corruption from they leader this be a story about the fact that person want they resource manage properly for they good and not take out to place where they will benefit just a few of the elite and therefore when you hear about the corrupt Africa corruption all the time I want you to know that the person and the government be try hard to fight this in some of the country and that some success be emerge do it mean the problem be over the answer be no there be still a long way to go but that there be a will there and that success be be chalk up on this very important fight so when you hear about corruption do not just feel that nothing be be do about this that you can not operate in any African country because of the overwhelming corruption that be not the case there be a will to fight and in many country that fight be ongoing and be be win in other like mine where there have be a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria the fight be ongoing and we have a long way to go but the truth of the matter be that this be go on the result be show independent monitoring by the World Bank and other organization show that in many instance the trend be downwards in term of corruption and governance be improve a study by the Economic Commission for Africa show a clear trend upwards in governance in 28 African country and let I say just one more thing before I leave this area of governance that be that person talk about corruption corruption all the time when they talk about it you immediately think about Africa that be the image African country but let I say this if Alams be able to export eight million dollar into a account in London if the other person who have take money estimate at 20 to 40 billion now of develop country money sit abroad in the develop country if they be able to do this what be that be that not corruption in this country if you receive steal goods be you not prosecute so when we talk about this kind of corruption let we also think about what be happen on the other side of the globe where the money be go and what can be do to stop it I be work on a initiative now along with the World Bank on asset recovery try to do what we can to get the money that have be take abroad develop country money to get that send back because if we can get the 20 billion dollar sit out there back it may be far more for some of this country than all the aid that be be put together applause the second thing I want to talk about be the will for reform African after they be tired we be tired of be the subject of everybody charity and care we be grateful but we know that we can take charge of we own destiny if we have the will to reform and what be happen in many African country now be a realization that no one can do it but we we have to do it we can invite partner who can support we but we have to start we have to reform we economy change we leadership become more democratic be more open to change and to information and this be what we start to do in one of the large country on the continent Nigeria in fact if you be not in Nigeria you be not in Africa I want to tell you that laughter one in four sub Saharan African be Nigerian and it have 140 million dynamic person chaotic person but very interesting person you will never be bored laughter what we start to do be to realize that we have to take charge and reform ourselves and with the support of a leader who be willing at the time to do the reform we put forward a comprehensive reform program which we develop ourselves not the International Monetary Fund not the World Bank where I work for 21 year and rise to be a vice president no one can do it for you you have to do it for yourself we put together a program that would one get the state out of business it have nothing it have no business be in the state should not be in the business of produce goods and service because it be inefficient and incompetent so we decide to privatize many of we enterprise applause we as a result we decide to liberalize many of we market can you believe that prior to this reform which start at the end of 2003 when I leave Washington to go and take up the post of Finance Minister we have a telecommunications company that be only able to develop 4 500 landline in its entire 30 year history laughter have a telephone in my country be a huge luxury you could not get it you have to bribe you have to do everything to get you phone when President Obasanjo support and launch the liberalization of the telecommunications sector we go from 4 500 landline to 32 million gsm line and count Nigeria telecom market be the second fast grow in the world after China we be get investment of about a billion dollar a year in telecom and nobody know except a few smart person laughter the smart one first to come in be the mtn company of South Africa and in the three year that I be Finance Minister they make a average of 360 million dollar profit per year 360 million in a market in a country that be a poor country with a average per capita income just under 500 dollar per capita so the market be there when they keep this under wrap but soon other get to know Nigerian themselves begin to develop some wireless telecommunications company and three or four other have come in but there be a huge market out there and person do not know about it or they do not want to know so privatization be one of the thing we have do the other thing we have also do be to manage we finances well because nobody be go to help you and support you if you be not manage you own finances well and Nigeria with the oil sector have the reputation of be corrupt and not manage its own public finances well so what do we try to do we introduce a fiscal rule that de link we budget from the oil price before we use to just budget on whatever oil we bring in because oil be the big most revenue earn sector in the economy 70 percent of we revenue come from oil we de link that and once we do it we begin to budget at a price slightly low than the oil price and save whatever be above that price we do not know we could pull it off it be very controversial but what it immediately do be that the volatility that have be present in term of we economic development where even if oil price be high we would grow very fast when they crash we crash and we could hardly even pay anything any salary in the economy that smoothen out we be able to save just before I leave 27 billion dollar whereas and this go to we reserve when I arrive in 2003 we have seven billion dollar in reserve by the time I leave we have go up to almost 30 billion dollar and as we speak now we have about 40 billion dollar in reserve due to proper management of we finances and that shore up we economy make it stable we exchange rate that use to fluctuate all the time be now fairly stable and be manage so that business person have a predictability of price in the economy we bring inflation down from 28 percent to about 11 percent and we have GDP grow from a average of 2 3 percent the previous decade to about 6 5 percent now so all the change and reform we be able to make have show up in result that be measurable in the economy and what be more important because we want to get away from oil and diversify and there be so many opportunity in this one big country as in many country in Africa what be remarkable be that much of this growth come not from the oil sector alone but from non oil agriculture grow at good than eight percent as telecom sector grow housing and construction and I could go on and on and this be to illustrate to you that once you get the macro economy straighten out the opportunity in various other sector be enormous we have opportunity in agriculture like I say we have opportunity in solid mineral we have a lot of mineral that no one have even invest in or explore and we realize that without the proper legislation to make that possible that would not happen so we have now get a mining code that be comparable with some of the good in the world we have opportunity in housing and real estate there be nothing in a country of 140 million person no shopping mall as you know they here this be a investment opportunity for someone that excite the imagination of person and now we have a situation in which the business in this mall be do four time the turnover that they have project so huge thing in construction real estate mortgage market financial service we have 89 bank too many not do they real business we consolidate they from 89 to 25 bank by require that they increase they capital share capital and it go from about 25 million dollar to 150 million dollar the bank this bank be now consolidated and that strengthening of the banking system have attract a lot of investment from outside Barclays Bank of the U K be bring in 500 million standard Chartered have bring in 140 million and I can go on dollar on and on into the system we be do the same with the insurance sector so in financial service a great deal of opportunity in tourism in many African country a great opportunity and that be what many person know East Africa for the wildlife the elephant and so on but manage the tourism market in a way that can really benefit the person be very important so what be I try to say I be try to tell you that there be a new wave on the continent a new wave of openness and democratization in which since 2000 more than two third of African country have have multi party democratic election not all of they have be perfect or will be but the trend be very clear I be try to tell you that since the past three year the average rate of growth on the continent have move from about 2 5 percent to about five percent per annum this be good than the performance of many OECD country so it be clear that thing be change conflict be down on the continent from about 12 conflict a decade ago we be down to three or four conflict one of the most terrible of course of which be Darfur and you know you have the neighborhood effect where if something be go on in one part of the continent it look like the entire continent be affect but you should know that this continent be not be a continent of many country not one country and if we be down to three or four conflict it mean that there be plenty of opportunity to invest in stable grow exciting economy where there be plenty of opportunity and I want to just make one point about this investment the good way to help African today be to help they to stand on they own foot and the good way to do that be by help create job there be no issue with fight malaria and put money in that and save child life that be not what I be say that be fine but imagine the impact on a family if the parent can be employ and make sure that they child go to school that they can buy the drug to fight the disease themselves if we can invest in place where you yourselve make money whilst create job and help person stand on they own foot be not that a wonderful opportunity be not that the way to go and I want to say that some of the good person to invest in on the continent be the woman applause I have a cd here I be sorry that I do not say anything on time otherwise I would have like you to have see this it say Africa Open for Business and this be a video that have actually win a award as the good documentary of the year understand that the woman who make it be go to be in Tanzania where they be have the session in June but it show you African and particularly African woman who against all odds have develop business some of they world class one of the woman in this video Adenike Ogunlesi make child clothes which she start as a hobby and grow into a business mix African material such as we have with material from elsewhere so she will make a little pair of dungarees with corduroy with African material mix in very creative design have reach a stage where she even have a order from Wal Mart laughter for 10 000 piece so that show you that we have person who be capable of do and the woman be diligent they be focus they work hard I could go on give example Beatrice Gakuba of Rwanda who open up a flower business and be now export to the dutch auction in Amsterdam each morning and be employ 200 other woman and man to work with she however many of this be starve for capital to expand because nobody believe outside of we country that we can do what be necessary nobody think in term of a market nobody think there be opportunity but I be stand here say that that who miss the boat now will miss it forever so if you want to be in Africa think about invest think about the Beatrices think about the Adenikes of this world who be do incredible thing that be bring they into the global economy whilst at the same time make sure that they fellow man and woman be employ and that the child in that household get educate because they parent be earn adequate income so I invite you to explore the opportunity when you go to Tanzania listen carefully because I be sure you will hear of the various opening that there will be for you to get involve in something that will do good for the continent for the person and for yourselve thank you very much applause
