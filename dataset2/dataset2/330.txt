I think I would start with tell you or show you the person who start Jet Propulsion Lab when they be a bunch of kid they be kind of very imaginative very adventurous as they be try at Caltech to mix chemical and see which one blow up more well I do not recommend that you try to do that now naturally they blow up a shack and Caltech well then hey you go to the Arroyo and really do all you test in there so that be what we call we first five employee during the tea break you know in here as I say they be adventurous person as a matter of fact one of they who be kind of part of a cult which be not too far from here on Orange Grove and unfortunately he blow up himself because he keep mix chemical and try to figure out which one be the good chemical so that give you a kind of flavor of the kind of person we have there we try to avoid blow ourselves up this one I think I would show you guess which one be a JPL employee in the heart of this crowd I try to come like he this morning but as I walk out then it be too cold and I say I would better put my shirt back on but more importantly the reason I want to show this picture look where the other person be look and look where he be look wherever anybody else look look somewhere else and go do something different you know and do that and that be kind of what have be the spirit of what we be do and I want to tell you a quote from Ralph Emerson that one of my colleague you know put on my wall in my office and it say do not go where the path may lead go instead where there be no path and leave a trail and that be my recommendation to all of you look what everybody be do what they be do go do something completely different do not try to improve a little bit on what somebody else be do because that do not get you very far in we early day we use to work a lot on rocket but we also use to have a lot of party you know as you can see one of we party you know a few year ago but then a big difference happen about 50 year ago after Sputnik be launch we launch the first American satellite and that be the one you see on the leave in there and here we make 180 degree change we change from a rocket house to be a exploration house and that be do over a period of a couple of year and now we be the lead organization you know explore space on all of you behalf but even when we do that we have to remind ourselves sometimes there be setback so you see on the bottom that rocket be suppose to go upward somehow it end go sideways so that be what we call the misguided missile but then also just to celebrate that we start a event at JPL for Miss guide missile so we use to have a celebration every year and select there use to be competition and parade and so on it be not very appropriate to do it now some person tell I to do it I think well that be not really proper you know this day so we do something a little bit more serious and that be what you see in the last Rose Bowl you know when we enter one of the float that be more on the play side and on the right side that be the Rover just before we finish its testing to take it to the Cape to launch it this be the Rovers up here that you have on Mars now so that kind of tell you about kind of the fun thing you know and the serious thing that we try to do but I say I be go to show you a short clip of one of we employee to kind of give you a idea about some of the talent that we have Video Morgan Hendry beware of Safety be a instrumental rock band it branch on more the experimental side there be the improvisational side of jazz there be the heavy hit sound of rock be able to treat sound as a instrument and be able to dig for more abstract sound and thing to play live mix electronics and acoustic the music half of I but the other half I land probably the good gig of all I work for the Jet Propulsion Lab I be build the next Mars Rover some of the most brilliant engineer I know be the one who have that sort of artistic quality about they you have get to do what you want to do and anyone who tell you you can not you do not listen to they maybe they be right I doubt it tell they where to put it and then just do what you want to do I be Morgan Hendry I be NASA Charles Elachi now move from the play stuff to the serious stuff always person ask why do we explore why be we do all of this mission and why be we explore they well the way I think about it be fairly simple somehow 13 billion year ago there be a Big Bang and you have hear a little bit about you know the origin of the universe but somehow what strike everybody imagination or lot of person imagination somehow from that original Big Bang we have this beautiful world that we live in today you look outside you have all that beauty that you see all that life that you see around you and here we have intelligent person like you and I who be have a conversation here all that start from that Big Bang so the question be how do that happen how do that evolve how do the universe form how do the galaxy form how do the planet form why be there a planet on which there be life which have evolve be that very common be there life on every planet that you can see around the star so we literally be all make out of stardust we start from that star we be make of stardust so next time you be really depressed look in the mirror and you can look and say hi I be look at a star here you can skip the dust part but literally we be all make of stardust so what we be try to do in we exploration be effectively write the book of how thing have come about as they be today and one of the first or the easy place we can go and explore that be to go towards Mars and the reason Mars take particular attention it be not very far from we you know it will take we only six month to get there six to nine month at the right time of the year it be a planet somewhat similar to Earth it be a little bit small but the land mass on Mars be about the same as the land mass on Earth you know if you do not take the ocean into account it have polar cap it have a atmosphere somewhat thin than ours so it have weather so it be very similar to some extent and you can see some of the feature on it like the Grand Canyon on Mars or what we call the Grand Canyon on Mars it be like the Grand Canyon on Earth except a hell of a lot large so it be about the size you know of the United States it have volcano on it and that be Mount Olympus on Mars which be a kind of huge volcanic shield on that planet and if you look at the height of it and you compare it to Mount Everest you see it will give you a idea of how large that Mount Olympus you know be relative to Mount Everest so it basically dwarf you know Mount Everest here on Earth so that give you a idea of the tectonic event or volcanic event which have happen on that planet recently from one of we satellite this show that it be Earth like we catch a landslide occur as it be happen so it be a dynamic planet and activity be go on as we speak today and this Rovers person wonder now what be they do today so I think I would show you a little bit what they be do this be one very large crater geologist love crater because crater be like dig a big hole in the ground without really work at it and you can see what be below the surface so this be call Victoria Crater which be about a few football field in size and if you look at the top left you see a little teeny dark dot this picture be take from a orbit satellite if I zoom on it you can see that be the Rover on the surface so that be take from orbit we have the camera zoom on the surface and we actually see the Rover on the surface and we actually use the combination of the satellite image and the Rover to actually conduct science because we can observe large area and then you can get that Rovers to move around and basically go to a certain location so specifically what we be do now be that Rover be go down in that crater as I tell you geologist love crater and the reason be many of you go to the Grand Canyon and you see in the wall of the Grand Canyon you see this layer and what this layer that be what the surface use to be a million year ago 10 million year ago 100 million year ago and you get deposit on top of they so if you can read the layer it be like read you book and you can learn the history of what happen in the past in that location so what you be see here be the layer on the wall of that crater and the Rover be go down now measure you know the property and analyze the rock as it be go down you know that canyon now it be kind of a little bit of a challenge drive down a slope like this if you be there you would not do it yourself but we really make sure we test that Rovers before we get they down or that Rover and make sure that it be all work well now when I come last time shortly after the landing I think it be like a hundred day after the landing I tell you I be surprised that that Rovers be last even a hundred day well here we be four year later and they be still work now you say Charles you be really lie to we and so on but that be not true we really believe they be go to last 90 day or 100 day because they be solar power and Mars be a dusty planet so we expect the dust would start accumulate on the surface and after a while we would not have enough power you know to keep they warm well I always say it be important that you be smart but every once in a while it be good to be lucky and that be what we find out it turn out that every once in a while there be dust devil which come by on Mars as you be see here and when the dust devil come over the Rover it just clean it up it be like a brand new car that you have and that be literally why they have last so long and now we design they reasonably well but that be exactly why they be last that long and still provide all the science datum now the two Rovers each one of they be kind of get old you know one of they one of the wheel be stuck be not work one of the front wheel so what we be do we be drive it backwards and the other one have arthritis of the shoulder joint you know it be not work very well so it be walk like this and we can move the arm you know that way but still they be produce a lot of scientific datum now during that whole period a number of person get excited you know outside the science community about this Rovers so I think I would show you a video just to give you a reflection about how this Rovers be be view by person other than the science community so let I go on the next short video by the way this video be pretty accurate of how the landing take place you know about four year ago Video okay we have parachute align okay deploy the airbag open Camera we have a picture right now yeah ce that be about what happen in the Houston operation room it be exactly like this video now if there be life the Dutch will find it what be he do what be that ce not too bad so anyway let I continue on show you a little bit about the beauty of that planet as I say early it look very much like Earth so you see sand dune it look like I could have tell you this be picture take from the Sahara Desert or somewhere and you would have believe I but this be picture take from Mars but one area which be particularly intriguing for we be the northern region you know of Mars close to the North Pole because we see ice cap and we see the ice cap shrink and expand so it be very much like you have in northern Canada and we want to find out and we see all kind of glacial feature on it so we want to find out actually what be that ice make of and could that have embed in it some organic you know material so we have a spacecraft which be head towards Mars call Phoenix and that spacecraft will land 17 day seven hour and 20 second from now so you can adjust you watch so it be on May 25 around just before five o clock we time here on the West Coast actually we will be land on another planet and as you can see this be a picture of the spacecraft put on Mars but I think that just in case you be go to miss that show you know in 17 day I will show you kind of a little bit of what be go to happen video that be what we call the seven minute of terror so the plan be to dig in the soil and take sample that we put they in a oven and actually heat they and look what gas will come from it so this be launch about nine month ago we will be come in at 12 000 mile per hour and in seven minute we have to stop and touch the surface very softly so we do not break that lander Ben Cichy Phoenix be the first Mars Scout mission it be the first mission that be go to try to land near the North Pole of Mars and it be the first mission that be actually go to try and reach out and touch water on the surface of another planet Lynn Craig where there tend to be water at least on Earth there tend to be life and so it be potentially a place where life could have exist on the planet in the past Erik Bailey the main purpose of edl be to take a spacecraft that be travel at 12 500 mile a hour and bring it to a screeching halt in a soft way in a very short amount of time bc we enter the Martian atmosphere we be 70 mile above the surface of Mars and we lander be safely tuck inside what we call a aeroshell EB look kind of like a ice cream cone more or less bc and on the front of it be this heat shield this saucer look thing that have about a half inch of essentially what be cork on the front of it which be we heat shield now this be really special cork and this cork be what be go to protect we from the violent atmospheric entry that we be about to experience Rob Grover Friction really start to build up on the spacecraft and we use the friction when it be fly through the atmosphere to we advantage to slow we down bc from this point we be go to decelerate from 12 500 mile a hour down to 900 mile a hour EB the outside can get almost as hot as the surface of the Sun RG the temperature of the heat shield can reach 2 600 degree Fahrenheit EB the inside do not get very hot it probably get about room temperature Richard Kornfeld there be this window of opportunity within which we can deploy the parachute EB if you fire the chute too early the parachute itself could fail the fabric and the stitching could just pull apart and that would be bad bc in the first 15 second after we deploy the parachute we will decelerate from 900 mile a hour to a relatively slow 250 mile a hour we no long need the heat shield to protect we from the force of atmospheric entry so we jettison the heat shield expose for the first time we lander to the atmosphere of Mars lc after the heat shield have be jettison and the leg be deploy the next step be to have the radar system begin to detect how far Phoenix really be from the ground bc we have lose 99 percent of we entry velocity so we be 99 percent of the way to where we want to be but that last one percent as it always seem to be be the tricky part EB now the spacecraft actually have to decide when it be go to get rid of its parachute bc we separate from the lander go 125 mile a hour at roughly a kilometer above the surface of Mars 3 200 foot that be like take two Empire State building and stack they on top of one another EB that be when we separate from the back shell and we be now in free fall it be a very scary moment a lot have to happen in a very short amount of time lc so it be in a free fall but it be also try to use all of its actuator to make sure that it be in the right position to land EB and then it have to light up its engine right itself and then slowly slow itself down and touch down on the ground safely BC Earth and Mars be so far apart that it take over ten minute for a signal from Mars to get to Earth and EDL itself be all over in a matter of seven minute so by the time you even hear from the lander that EDL have start it will already be over EB we have to build large amount of autonomy into the spacecraft so that it can land itself safely BC EDL be this immense technically challenging problem it be about get a spacecraft that be hurtle through deep space and use all this bag of trick to somehow figure out how to get it down to the surface of Mars at zero mile a hour it be this immensely exciting and challenging problem CE hopefully it all will happen the way you see it in here so it will be a very tense moment you know as we be watch that spacecraft landing on another planet so now let I talk about the next thing that we be do so we be in the process as we speak of actually design the next Rover that we be go to be send to Mars so I think I would go a little bit and tell you kind of the step we go through it be very similar to what you do when you design you product as you see a little bit early when we be do the Phoenix one we have to take into account the heat that we be go to be face so we have to study all kind of different material the shape that we want to do in general we do not try to please the customer here what we want to do be to make sure we have a effective you know a efficient kind of machine first we start by we want to have we employee to be as imaginative as they can and we really love be close to the art center because we have as a matter of fact one of the alumnus from the art center Eric Nyquist have put a series of display far out display you know in we what we call mission design or spacecraft design room just to get person to think wildly about thing we have a bunch of Legos so as I say this be a playground for adult where they sit down and try to play with different shape and different design then we get a little bit more serious so we have what we call we CAD cam and all the engineer who be involved or scientist who be involve who know about thermal property know about design know about atmospheric interaction parachute all of this thing which they work in a team effort and actually design a spacecraft in a computer to some extent so to see do that meet the requirement that we need on the right also we have to take into account the environment of the planet where we be go if you be go to Jupiter you have a very high radiation you know environment it be about the same radiation environment close by Jupiter as inside a nuclear reactor so just imagine you take you p c and throw it into a nuclear reactor and it still have to work so this be kind of some of the little challenge you know that we have to face if we be do entry we have to do test of parachute you see in the video a parachute break that would be a bad day you know if that happen so we have to test because we be deploy this parachute at supersonic speed we be come at extremely high speed and we be deploy they to slow we down so we have to do all kind of test to give you a idea of the size you know of that parachute relative to the person stand there next step we go and actually build some kind of test model and actually test they you know in the lab at JPL in what we call we Mars Yard we kick they we hit they we drop they just to make sure we understand how where would they break and then we back off you know from that point and then we actually do the actual building and the flight and this next Rover that we be fly be about the size of a car that big shield that you see outside that be a heat shield which be go to protect it and that will be basically build over the next year and it will be launch June a year from now now in that case because it be a very big Rover we could not use airbag and I know many of you kind of last time afterwards say well that be a cool thing to have that airbag unfortunately this Rover be like ten time the size of the you know mass wise of the other Rover or three time the mass so we can not use airbag so we have to come up with another ingenious idea of how do we land it and we do not want to take it propulsively all the way to the surface because we do not want to contaminate the surface we want the Rover to immediately land on its leg so we come up with this ingenious idea which be use here on Earth for helicopter actually the lander will come down to about 100 foot and hover above that surface for 100 foot and then we have a sky crane which will take that Rover and land it down on the surface hopefully it all will work you know it will work that way and that Rover will be more kind of like a chemist what we be go to be do with that Rover as it drive around it be go to go and analyze the chemical composition of rock so it will have a arm which will take sample put they in a oven crush and analyze they but also if there be something that we can not reach because it be too high on a cliff we have a little laser system which will actually zap the rock evaporate some of it and actually analyze what be come from that rock so it be a little bit like Star Wars you know but it be real it be real stuff and also to help you to help the community so you can do ad on that Rover we be go to train that Rover to actually in addition to do this to actually serve cocktail you know also on Mars so that be kind of give you a idea of the kind of you know fun thing we be do on Mars I think I would go to the Lord of the Rings now and show you some of the thing we have there now the Lord of the Rings have two thing play through it one it be a very attractive planet it just have the beauty of the ring and so on but for scientist also the ring have a special meaning because we believe they represent on a small scale how the Solar System actually form some of the scientist believe that the way the Solar System form that the Sun when it collapse and actually create the Sun a lot of the dust around it create ring and then the particle in that ring accumulate together and they form big rock and then that be how the planet you know be form so the idea be by watch Saturn we be actually watch we solar system in real time be form on a small scale so it be like a test bed for it so let I show you a little bit on what that saturnian system look like First I be go to fly you over the ring by the way all of this be real stuff this be not animation or anything like this this be actually take from the satellite that we have in orbit around Saturn the Cassini and you see the amount of detail that be in that ring which be the particle some of they be agglomerate together to form large particle so that be why you have this gap be because a small satellite you know be be form in that location now you think that that ring be very large object yes they be very large in one dimension in the other dimension they be paper thin very very thin what you be see here be the shadow of the ring on Saturn itself and that be one of the satellite which be actually form on that one so think about it as a paper thin huge area of many hundred of thousand of mile which be rotate and we have a wide variety of kind of satellite which will form each one look very different and very odd and that keep scientist busy for ten of year try to explain this and tell NASA we need more money so we can explain what this thing look like or why they form that way well there be two satellite which be particularly interesting one of they be call Enceladus it be a satellite which be all make of ice and we measure it from orbit make of ice but there be something bizarre about it if you look at this stripe in here what we call tiger stripe when we fly over they all of a sudden we see a increase in the temperature which say that that stripe be warm than the rest of the planet so as we fly by away from it we look back and guess what we see geyser come out so this be a Yellowstone you know of Saturn we be see geyser of ice which be come out of that planet which indicate that most likely there be a ocean you know below the surface and somehow through some dynamic effect we be have this geyser which be be you know emit from it and the reason I show the little arrow there I think that should say 30 mile we decide a few month ago to actually fly the spacecraft through the plume of that geyser so we can actually measure the material that it be make of that be unclear also you know because we be worried about the risk of it but it work pretty well we fly at the top of it and we find that there be a fair amount of organic material which be be emit in combination with the ice and over the next few year as we keep orbit you know Saturn we be plan to get close and close down to the surface and make more accurate measurement now another satellite also attract a lot of attention and that be Titan and the reason Titan be particularly interesting it be a satellite big than we moon and it have a atmosphere and that atmosphere be very as dense as we own atmosphere so if you be on Titan you would feel the same pressure that you feel in here except it be a lot cold and that atmosphere be heavily make of methane now methane get person all excited because it be organic material so immediately person start think could life have evolve in that location when you have a lot of organic material so person believe now that Titan be most likely what we call a pre biotic planet because it be so cold organic material do not get to the stage of become biological material and therefore life could have evolve on it so it could be Earth freeze three billion year ago before life actually start on it so that be get a lot of interest and to show you some example of what we do in there we actually drop a probe which be develop by we colleague in Europe we drop a probe as we be orbit Saturn we drop a probe in the atmosphere of Titan and this be a picture of a area as we be come down just look like the coast of California for I you see the river which be come along the coast and you see that white area which look like Catalina Island and that look like a ocean and then with a instrument we have on board a radar instrument we find there be lake like the great lake in here so it look very much like Earth it look like there be river on it there be ocean or lake we know there be cloud we think it be rain also on it so it be very much like the cycle on Earth except because it be so cold it could not be water you know because water would have freeze what it turn out that all that we be see all this liquid be make of hydrocarbon and ethane and methane similar to what you put in you car so here we have a cycle of a planet which be like we earth but be all make of ethane and methane and organic material so if you be on Mars sorry on Titan you do not have to worry about four dollar gasoline you just drive to the near lake stick you hose in it and you have get you car fill up on the other hand if you light a match the whole planet will blow up so in closing I say I want to close by a couple of picture and just to kind of put we in perspective this be a picture of Saturn take with a spacecraft from behind Saturn look towards the Sun the Sun be behind Saturn so we see what we call forward scatter so it highlight all the ring and I be go to zoom there be a I be not sure you can see it very well but on the top leave around 10 o clock there be a little teeny dot and that be Earth you barely can see ourselves so what I do I think I would zoom on it so as you zoom in you know you can see Earth you know just in the middle here so we zoom all the way on the art center so thank you very much
