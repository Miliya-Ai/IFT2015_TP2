so I kind of believe that we be in like the cave paint era of computer interface like they be very kind of they do not go as deep or as emotionally engage as they possibly could be and I would like to change all that hit I ok so I mean this be the kind of status quo interface right it be very flat kind of rigid and ok so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable Mac you know but really it be the kind of same old crap we have have for the last you know 30 year laughter applause like I think we really put up with a lot of crap with we computer I mean it be point and click it be like the menu icon it be all the kind of same thing and so one kind of information space that I take inspiration from be my real desk it be so much more subtle so much more visceral you know what be visible what be not and I would like to bring that experience to the desktop so I kind of have a this be BumpTop it be kind of like a new approach to desktop computing so you can bump thing they be all physically you know manipulable and stuff and instead of that point and click it be like a push and pull thing collide as you would expect they just like on my real desk I can let I just grab this guy I can turn thing into pile instead of just the folder that we have and once thing be in a pile I can browse they by throw they into a grid or you know flip through they like a book or I can lay they out like a deck of card when they be lay out I can pull thing to new location or delete thing or just quickly sort a whole pile you know just immediately right and then it be all smoothly animate instead of this jarring change you see in today interface also if I want to add something to a pile well how do I do that I just toss it to the pile and it be add right to the top it be a kind of nice way also some of the stuff we can do be for this individual icon we think I mean how can we play with the idea of a icon and push that further and one of the thing I can do be make it big if I want to emphasize it and make it more important but what be really cool be that since there be a physics simulation run under this it be actually heavy so the light stuff do not really move but if I throw it at the light guy right laughter so it be cute but it be also like a subtle channel of convey information right this be heavy so it feel more important so it be kind of cool despite computer everywhere paper really have not disappear because it have a lot of I think valuable property and some of that we want to transfer to the icon in we system so one of the thing you can do to we icon just like paper be crease they and fold they just like paper remember you know something for later or if you want to be destructive you can just crumple it up and you know toss it to the corner also just like paper around we workspace we will pin thing up to the wall to remember they later and I can do the same thing here and you know you will see post it note and thing like that around person office and I can pull they off when I want to work with they so one of the criticism of this kind of approach to organization be that you know okay well my real desk be really messy I do not want that mess on my computer so one thing we have for that be like a grid align kind of so you get that more traditional desktop thing be kind of grid align more boring but you still have that kind of collide and bump and you can still do fun thing like make shelf on you desktop let just break this shelf okay that shelf break I think beyond the icon I think another really cool domain for this software I think it apply to more than just icon and you desktop but browsing photograph I think you can really enrich the way we browse we photograph and bring it to that kind of shoebox of you know photo with you family on the kitchen table kind of thing I can toss this thing around they be so much more tangible and touchable and you know I can double click on something to take a look at it and I can do all that kind of same stuff I show you before so I can pile thing up I can flip through it I can you know okay let move this photo to the back let delete this guy here and I think it be just a much more rich kind of way of interact with you information and that be BumpTop thanks
