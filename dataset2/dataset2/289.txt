I think it will be a relief to some person and a disappointment to other that I be not go to talk about vagina today I begin the Vagina Monologues because I be worry about vagina I be very worried today about this notion this world this prevail kind of force of security I see this word hear this word feel this word everywhere real security security check security watch security clearance why have all this focus on security make I feel so much more insecure what do anyone mean when they talk about real security and why have we as American particularly become a nation that strive for security above all else in fact I think that security be elusive it be impossible we all die we all get old we all get sick person leave we person change we nothing be secure and that be actually the good news this be of course unless you whole life be about be secure I think that when that be the focus of you life this be the thing that happen you can not travel very far or venture too far outside a certain circle you can not allow too many conflicting idea into you mind at one time as they might confuse you or challenge you you can not open yourself to new experience new person new way of do thing they might take you off course you can not not know who you be so you cling to hard matter identity you become a Christian Muslim Jew you be a Indian Egyptian Italian American you be a heterosexual or a homosexual or you never have sex or at least that be what you say when you identify yourself you become part of a we in order to be secure you defend against they you cling to you land because it be you secure place you must fight anyone who encroach upon it you become you nation you become you religion you become whatever it be that will freeze you numb you and protect you from doubt or change but all this do actually be shut down you mind in reality it do not really make you safe I be in Sri Lanka for example three day after the tsunami and I be stand on the beach and it be absolutely clear that in a matter of five minute a 30 foot wave could rise up and desecrate a person a population and live all this strive for security in fact have make you much more insecure because now you have to watch out all the time there be person not like you person who you now call enemy you have place you can not go thought you can not think world that you can no longer inhabit and so you spend you day fight thing off defend you territory and become more entrenched in you fundamental think you day become devoted to protect yourself this become you mission that be all you do idea get short they become sound byte there be evildoer and saint criminal and victim there be that who if they be not with we be against we it get easy to hurt person because you do not feel what be inside they it get easy to lock they up force they to be naked humiliate they occupy they invade they and kill they because they be only obstacle now to you security in six year I have have the extraordinary privilege through V Day a global movement against violence against woman to travel probably to 60 country and spend a great deal of time in different portion I have meet woman and man all over this planet who through various circumstance war poverty racism multiple form of violence have never know security or have have they illusion of security forever devastate I have spend time with woman in Afghanistan under the Taliban who be essentially brutalize and censor I have be in bosnian refugee camp I be with woman in Pakistan who have have they face melt off with acid I have be with girl all across America who be date rape or rape by they good friend when they be drug one night one of the amazing thing that I have discover in my travels be that there be this emerge species I love when he be talk about this other world that be right next to this world I have discover this person who in V Day world we call Vagina warrior this particular person rather than get AK 47 or weapon of mass destruction or machete in the spirit of the warrior have go into the center the heart of pain of loss they have grieve it they have die into it and allow and encourage poison to turn into medicine they have use the fuel of they pain to begin to redirect that energy towards another mission and another trajectory this warrior now devote themselves and they life to make sure what happen to they do not happen to anyone else there be thousand if not million of they on the planet I venture there be many in this room they have a fierceness and a freedom that I believe be the bedrock of a new paradigm they have break out of the exist frame of victim and perpetrator they own personal security be not they end goal and because of that because rather than worry about security because the transformation of suffering be they end goal I actually believe they be create real safety and a whole new idea of security I want to talk about a few of this person that I have meet tomorrow I be go to Cairo and I be so move that I will be with woman in Cairo who be V Day woman who be open the first safe house for batter woman in the Middle East that will happen because woman in Cairo make a decision to stand up and put themselves on the line and talk about the degree of violence that be happen in Egypt and be willing to be attack and criticize and through they work over the last year this be not only happen that this house be open but it be be support by many faction of the society who never would have support it Women in Uganda this year who put on the Vagina Monologues during V Day actually evoke the wrath of the government and I love this story so much there be a cabinet meeting and a meeting of the president to talk about whether Vaginas could come to Uganda and in this meeting it go on for week in the press two week where there be huge discussion the government finally make a decision that the Vagina Monologues could not be perform in Uganda but the amazing news be that because they have stand up this woman and because they have be willing to risk they security it begin a discussion that not only happen in Uganda but all of Africa as a result this production which have already sell out every single person in that 800 seat audience except for 10 person make a decision to keep the money they raise 10 000 dollar on a production that never occur there be a young woman name Carrie Rethlefsen in Minnesota she be a high school student she have see the Vagina Monologues and she be really move and as a result she wear a i heart my vagina button to she high school in Minnesota laughter she be basically threaten to be expel from school they tell she she could not love she vagina in high school that it be not a legal thing that it be not a moral thing that it be not a good thing so she really struggle with this what to do because she be a senior and she be do well in she school and she be threaten expulsion so what she do be she get all she friend together I believe it be 100 150 student all wear I love my vagina t shirt and the boy wear I love she vagina t shirt to school laughter now this seem like a fairly you know frivolous but what happen as a result of that be that that school now be form a sex education class it be begin to talk about sex it be begin to look at why it would be wrong for a young high school girl to talk about she vagina publicly or to say that she love she vagina publicly I know I have talk about Agnes here before but I want to give you a update on Agnes I meet Agnes three year ago in the Rift Valley when she be a young girl she have be mutilate against she will that mutilation of she clitoris have actually obviously impact she life and change it in a way that be devastate she make a decision not to go and get a razor or a glass shard but to devote she life to stop that happen to other girl for eight year she walk through the Rift Valley she have this amazing box that she carry and it have a torso of a woman body in it a half a torso and she would teach person everywhere she go what a healthy vagina look like and what a mutilate vagina look like in the year that she walk she educate parent mother father she save 1 500 girl from be cut when V Day meet she we ask she how we could support she and she say well if you get I a Jeep I could get around a lot fast so we buy she a jeep in the year she have the jeep she save 4 500 girl from be cut so we say what else could we do she say if you help I get money I could open a house three year ago Agnes open a safe house in Africa to stop mutilation when she begin she mission eight year ago she be revile she be det she be completely sland in she community I be proud to tell you that six month ago she be elect the deputy mayor of Narok applause I think what I be try to say here be that if you end goal be security and if that be all you be focus on what end up happen be that you create not only more insecurity in other person but you make yourself far more insecure real security be contemplate death not pretend it do not exist not run from loss but enter grief surrender to sorrow real security be not know something when you do not know it real security be hunger for connection rather than power it can not be buy or arrange or make with bomb it be deep it be a process it be acute awareness that we be all utterly inter bend and one action by one be in one tiny town have consequence everywhere real security be not only be able to tolerate mystery complexity ambiguity but hungering for they and only trust a situation when they be present something happen when I begin travel in V Day eight year ago I get lose I remember be on a plane go from Kenya to South Africa and I have no idea where I be I do not know where I be go where I would come from and I panic I have a total anxiety attack and then I suddenly realize that it absolutely do not matter where I be go or where I have come from because we be all essentially permanently displace person all of we be refugee we come from somewhere and we be hopefully travel all the time move towards a new place Freedom mean I may not be identify as any one group but that I can visit and find myself in every group it do not mean that I do not have value or belief but it do mean I be not harden around they I do not use they as weapon in the share future it will be just that share the end goal will be become vulnerable realize the place of we connection to one another rather than become secure in control and alone thank you very much applause Chris Anderson and how be you do be you exhausted on a typical day do you wake up with hope or gloom Eve Ensler you know I think Carl Jung once say that in order to survive the twentieth century we have to live with two exist think opposite thought at the same time and I think part of what I be learn in this process be that one must allow oneself to feel grief and I think as long as I keep grieving and weep and then move on I be fine when I start to pretend that what I be see be not impact I and be not change my heart then I get in trouble because when you spend a lot of time go from place to place country to country and city to city the degree to which woman for example be violate and the epidemic of it and the kind of ordinariness of it be so devastating to one soul that you have to take the time or I have to take the time now to process that ca there be a lot of cause out there in the world that have be talk about you know poverty sickness and so on you spend eight year on this one why this one ee I think that if you think about woman woman be the primary resource of the planet they give birth we come from they they be mother they be visionary they be the future if you think that the U N now say that one out of three woman on the planet will be rape or beat in they lifetime we be talk about the desecration of the primary resource of the planet we be talk about the place where we come from we be talk about parenting imagine that you have be rape and you be bring up a boy child how do it impact you ability to work or envision a future or thrive as oppose to just survive what I believe be if we could figure out how to make woman safe and honor woman it would be parallel or equal to honor life itself
