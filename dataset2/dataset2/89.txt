in 1962 with Rachel Carson Silent Spring I think for person like I in the world of the making of thing the canary in the mine be not sing and so the question that we might not have bird become kind of fundamental to that of we wander around look for the meadowlark that seem to have all disappear and the question be be the bird sing now I be not a scientist that will be really clear but you know we have just come from this discussion of what a bird might be what be a bird well in my world this be a rubber duck it come in California with a warning this product contain chemical know by the state of California to cause cancer and birth defect or other reproductive harm this be a bird what kind of culture would produce a product of this kind and then label it and sell it to child I think we have a design problem someone hear the six hour of talk that I give call the Monticello dialogue on NPR and send I this as a thank you note we realize that design be a signal of intention but it also have to occur within a world and we have to understand that world in order to imbue we design with inherent intelligence and so as we look back at the basic state of affair in which we design we in a way need to go to the primordial condition to understand the operating system and the frame condition of a planet and I think the exciting part of that be the good news that be there because the news be the news of abundance and not the news of limit and I think as we culture torture itself now with tyranny and concern over limit and fear we can add this other dimension of abundance that be coherent drive by the sun and start to imagine what that would be like to share that be a nice thing to get that be one sentence Henry James would be proud this be I put it down at the bottom but that be extemporaneous obviously the fundamental issue be that for I design be the first signal of human intention so what be we intention and what would we intention be if we wake up in the morning we have design on the world well what would we intention be as a species now that we be the dominant species and it be not just stewardship and dominion debate because really dominion be implicit in stewardship because how could you dominate something you have kill and stewardship implicit in dominion because you can not be steward of something if you can not dominate it so the question be what be the first question for designer now as guardian let say the state for example which reserve the right to kill the right to be duplicitous and so on the question we be ask the guardian at this point be be we mean how be we mean to secure local society create world peace and save the environment but I do not know that that be the common debate Commerce on the other hand be relatively quick essentially creative highly effective and efficient and fundamentally honest because we can not exchange value for very long if we do not trust each other so we use the tool of commerce primarily for we work but the question we bring to it be how do we love all the child of all species for all time and so we start we design with that question because what we realize today be that modern culture appear to have adopt a strategy of tragedy if we come here and say well I do not intend to cause global warming on the way here and we say that be not part of my plan then we realize it be part of we de facto plan because it be the thing that be happen because we have no other plan and I be at the White House for President Bush meeting with every federal department and agency and I point out that they appear to have no plan if the end game be global warming they be do great if the end game be mercury toxification of we child downwind of coal fire plant as they scuttle the Clean Air Act then I see that we education program should be explicitly define as Brain death for all child no child leave behind applause so the question be how many federal official be ready to move to Ohio and Pennsylvania with they family so if you do not have a endgame of something delightful then you be just move chess piece around if you do not know you be take the king so perhaps we could develop a strategy of change which require humility and in my business as a architect it be unfortunate the word humility and the word architect have not appear in the same paragraph since the fountainhead so if anybody here have trouble with the concept of design humility reflect on this it take we 5 000 year to put wheel on we luggage so as Kevin Kelly point out there be no endgame there be a infinite game and we be play in that infinite game and so we call it cradle to cradle and we goal be very simple this be what I present to the White House we goal be a delightfully diverse safe healthy and just world with clean air clean water soil and power economically equitably ecologically and elegantly enjoy period applause what do not you like about this which part of this do not you like so we realize we want full diversity even though it can be difficult to remember what De Gaulle say when ask what it be like to be President of France he say what do you think it be like try to run a country with 400 kind of cheese but at the same time we realize that we product be not safe and healthy so we have design product and we analyze chemical down to the part per million this be a baby blanket by Pendleton that will give you child nutrition instead of Alzheimer late in life we can ask ourselves what be justice and be justice blind or be justice blindness and at what point do that uniform turn from white to black water have be declare a human right by the United Nations Air quality be a obvious thing to anyone who breathe be there anybody here who do not breathe clean soil be a critical problem the nitrification the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico A fundamental issue that be not be address we have see the first form of solar energy that be beat the hegemony of fossil fuel in the form of wind here in the Great Plains and so that hegemony be leave and if we remember Sheikh Yamani when he form OPEC they ask he when will we see the end of the age of oil I do not know if you remember he answer but it be the Stone Age do not end because we run out of stone we see that company act ethically in this world be outperform that that do not we see the flow of material in a rather terrifying prospect this be a hospital monitor from Los Angeles send to China this woman will expose herself to toxic phosphorous release four pound of toxic lead into she children environment which be from copper on the other hand we see great sign of hope here be Dr Venkataswamy in India who be figure out how to do mass produce health he have give eyesight to two million person for free we see in we material flow that car steel do not become car steel again because of the contaminant of the coating bismuth antimony copper and so on they become build steel on the other hand we be work with Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett and Shaw Carpet the large carpet company in the world we have develop a carpet that be continuously recyclable down to the part per million the upper be Nylon 6 that can go back to caprolactam the bottom a polyolephine infinitely recyclable thermoplastic now if I be a bird the building on my left be a liability the building on my right which be we corporate campus for the gap with a ancient meadow be a asset its nesting grounds here be where I come from I grow up in Hong Kong with six million person in 40 square mile during the dry season we have four hour of water every fourth day and the relationship to landscape be that of farmer who have be farm the same piece of ground for 40 century you can not farm the same piece of ground for 40 century without understand nutrient flow my childhood summer be in the Puget Sound of Washington among the first growth and big growth my grandfather have be a lumberjack in the Olympics so I have a lot of tree karma I be work off I go to Yale for graduate school study in a building of this style by Le Corbusier affectionately know in we business as Brutalism if we look at the world of architecture we see with Mies 1928 tower for Berlin the question might be well where be the sun and this might have work in Berlin but we build it in Houston and the window be all closed and with most product appear not to have be design for indoor use this be actually a vertical gas chamber when I go to Yale we have the first energy crisis and I be design the first solar heat house in Ireland as a student which I then build which would give you a sense of my ambition and Richard Meier who be one of my teacher keep come over to my desk to give I criticism and he would say Bill you have get to understand solar energy have nothing to do with architecture I guess he do not read Vitruvius in 1984 we do the first so call green office in America for Environmental Defense we start ask manufacturer what be in they material they say they be proprietary they be legal go away the only indoor quality work do in this country at that time be sponsor by R J Reynolds Tobacco Company and it be to prove there be no danger from secondhand smoke in the workplace so all of a sudden here I be graduate from high school in 1969 and this happen and we realize that away go away remember we use to throw thing away and we would point to away and yet NOAA have now show we for example you see that little blue thing above Hawaii that be the Pacific Gyre it be recently drag for plankton by scientist and they find six time as much plastic as plankton when ask they say it be kind of like a giant toilet that do not flush perhaps that be away so we be look for the design rule of this this be the high biodiversity of tree in the world Irian Jaya 259 species of tree and we describe this in the book cradle to Cradle the book itself be a polymer it be not a tree that be the name of the first chapter this Book be not a Tree because in poetic as Margaret Atwood point out we write we history on the skin of fish with the blood of bear and with so much polymer what we really need be technical nutrition and to use something as elegant as a tree imagine this design assignment design something that make oxygen sequester carbon fix nitrogen distil water accrue solar energy as fuel make complex sugar and food create microclimate change color with the season and self replicate well why do not we knock that down and write on it laughter so we be look at the same criterion as most person you know can I afford it do it work do I like it we be add the jeffersonian agenda and I come from Charlottesville where I have have the privilege of live in a house design by Thomas Jefferson we be add life liberty and the pursuit of happiness now if we look at the word competition I be sure most of you have use it you know most person do not realize it come from the latin competere which mean strive together it mean the way Olympic athlete train with each other they get fit together and then they compete the Williams sister compete one win Wimbledon so we have be look at the idea of competition as a way of cooperate in order to get fit together and the Chinese government have now I work with the Chinese government now have take this up we be also look at survival of the fit not in just competition term in we modern context of destroy the other or beat they to the ground but really to fit together and build niche and have growth that be good now most environmentalist do not say growth be good because in we lexicon asphalt be two word assign blame but if we look at asphalt as we growth then we realize that all we be do be destroy the planetary fundamental underlie operating system so when we see e equal mc square come along from a poet perspective we see energy as physics chemistry as mass and all of a sudden you get this biology and we have plenty of energy so we will solve that problem but the biology problem tricky because as we put through all this toxic material that we disgorge we will never be able to recover that and as Francis Crick point out nine year after discover dna with Mr Watson that life itself have to have growth as a precondition it have to have free energy sunlight and it need to be a open system of chemical so we be ask for human artifice to become a living thing and we want growth we want free energy from sunlight and we want a open metabolism for chemical then the question become not growth or no growth but what do you want to grow so instead of just grow destruction we want to grow the thing that we might enjoy and someday the FDA will allow we to make French cheese so therefore we have this two metabolism and I work with a German chemist Michael Braungart and we have identify the two fundamental metabolism the biological one I be sure you understand but also the technical one where we take material and put they into closed cycle we call they biological nutrition and technical nutrition technical nutrition will be in a order of magnitude of biological nutrition Biological nutrition can supply about 500 million human which mean that if we all wear Birkenstocks and cotton the world would run out of cork and dry up so we need material in closed cycle but we need to analyze they down to the part per million for cancer birth defect mutagenic effect disruption of we immune system biodegradation persistence heavy metal content knowledge of how we be make they and they production and so on we first product be a textile where we analyze 8 000 chemical in the textile industry use that intellectual filter we eliminate 7 962 we be leave with 38 chemical we have since database the 4000 most commonly use chemical in human manufacturing and we be release this database into the public in six week so designer all over the world can analyze they product down to the part per million for human and ecological health applause we have develop a protocol so that company can send this same message all the way through they supply chain because when we ask most company we work with about a trillion dollar and say where do you stuff come from they say supplier and where do it go customer so we need some help there so the biological nutrient the first fabric the water come out be clean enough to drink technical nutrient this be for Shaw Carpet infinitely reusable carpet here be nylon go back to caprolactam back to carpet Biotechnical nutrient the Model U for Ford Motor a cradle to cradle car concept car shoe for Nike where the upper be polyester infinitely recyclable the bottom be biodegradable sole wear you old shoe in you new shoe out there be no finish line the idea here of the car be that some of the material go back to the industry forever some of the material go back to soil it be all solar powered here be a building at Oberlin College we design that make more energy than it need to operate and purify its own water here be a building for the gap where the ancient grass of San Bruno California be on the roof and this be we project for Ford Motor Company it be the revitalization of the River Rouge in Dearborn this be obviously a color photograph this be we tool this be how we sell it to Ford we save Ford 35 million dollar do it this way day one which be the equivalent of the Ford Taurus at a four percent margin of a order for 900 million dollar worth of car here it be it be the world large green roof 10 and a half acre this be the roof save money and this be the first species to arrive here this be killdeer they show up in five day and we now have 350 pound auto worker learn bird song on the internet we be develop now protocol for city that be the home of technical nutrient the country the home of biological and put they together and so I will finish by show you a new city we be design for the Chinese government we be do 12 city for China right now base on cradle to cradle as template we assignment be to develop protocol for the housing for 400 million person in 12 year we do a mass energy balance if they use brick they will lose all they soil and burn all they coal they will have city with no energy and no food we sign a Memorandum of understand here be Madam Deng Nan Deng Xiaoping daughter for China to adopt cradle to cradle because if they toxify themselves be the low cost producer send it to the low cost distribution Wal Mart and then we send they all we money what we will discover be that we have what effectively when I be a student be call mutually assure destruction now we do it by molecule this be we city we be build a new city next to this city look at that landscape this be the site we do not normally do green field but this one be about to be build so they bring we in to intercede this be they plan it be a rubber stamp grid that they lay right on that landscape and they bring we in and say what would you do this be what they would end up with which be another color photograph so this be the exist site so this be what it look like now and here be we proposal applause so the way we approach this be we study the hydrology very carefully we study the biota the ancient biota the current farming and the protocol we study the wind and the sun to make sure everybody in the city will have fresh air fresh water and direct sunlight in every single apartment at some point during the day we then take the park and lay they out as ecological infrastructure we lay out the building area we start to integrate commercial and mixed use so the person all have center and place to be the transportation be all very simple everybody within a five minute walk of mobility we have a 24 hour street so that there be always a place that be alive the waste system all connect if you flush a toilet you feces will go to the sewage treatment plant which be sell as asset not liability because who want the fertilizer factory that make natural gas the water be all take in to construct the wetland for habitat restoration and then it make natural gas which then go back into the city to power the fuel for the cooking for the city so this be this be fertilizer gas plant and then the compost be all take back to the roof of the city where we have get farming because what we have do be lift up the city the landscape into the air to to restore the native landscape on the roof of the building the solar power of all the factory center and all the industrial zone with they light roof power the city and this be the concept for the top of the city we have lift the earth up onto the roof the farmer have little bridge to get from one roof to the next we inhabit the city with work live space on all the ground floor and so this be the exist city and this be the new city applause
