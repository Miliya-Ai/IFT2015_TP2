I be go to try and explain why it be that perhaps we do not understand as much as we think we do I would like to begin with four question this be not some sort of cultural thing for the time of year that be a in joke by the way but this four question actually be one that person who even know quite a lot about science find quite hard and they be question that I have ask of science television producer of audience of science educator so that be science teacher and also of seven year old and I find that the seven year old do marginally good than the other audience which be somewhat surprising so the first question and you might want to write this down either on a bit of paper physically or a virtual piece of paper in you head and for viewer at home you can try this as well a little seed weigh next to nothing and a tree weigh a lot right I think we agree on that where do the tree get the stuff that make up this chair right where do all this stuff come from Knocks and you next question be can you light a little torch bulb with a battery a bulb and one piece of wire and would you be able to kind of draw a you do not have to draw the diagram but would you be able to draw the diagram if you have to do it or would you just say that be actually not possible the third question be why be it hot in summer than in winter I think we can probably agree that it be hot in summer than in winter but why and finally would you be able to and you can sort of scribble it if you like scribble a plan diagram of the solar system show the shape of the planet orbit would you be able to do that and if you can just scribble a pattern ok now child get they idea not from teacher as teacher often think but actually from common sense from experience of the world around they from all the thing that go on between they and they peer and they carer and they parent and all of that experience and one of the great expert in this field of course be bless he Cardinal Wolsey be very careful what you get into person head because it be virtually impossible to shift it afterwards right laughter I be not quite sure how he die actually be he behead in the end or hang laughter now that question which of course you have get right and you have not be confer and so on and I you know normally I would pick person out and humiliate but maybe not in this instance a little seed weigh a lot and basically all this stuff 99 percent of this stuff come out of the air now I guarantee that about 85 percent of you or maybe it be few at TED will have say it come out of the ground and some person probably two of you will come up and argue with I afterwards and say that actually it come out of the ground now if that be true we would have truck go round the country fill person garden in with soil it would be a fantastic business but actually we do not do that the mass of this come out of the air now I pass all my biology exam in Britain I pass they really well but I still come out of school thinking that that stuff come out of the ground second one can you light a little torch bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire yes you can and I will show you in a second how to do that now I have some rather bad news which be that I have a piece of video that I be about to show you which unfortunately the sound do not work in this room so I be go to describe to you in true Monty Python fashion what happen in the video and in the video a group of researcher go to MIT on graduation day we choose MIT because obviously that be a very long way away from here and you would not mind too much but it sort of work the same way in Britain and in the West Coast of the USA and we ask they this question and we ask that question of science graduate and they could not answer they and so there be a whole lot of person say I would be very surprised if you tell I that this come out of the air that be very surprising to I and that be science graduate and we intercut it with we be the premier science university in the world because of British like hubris laughter and when we give graduate engineer that question they say it could not be do and when we give they a battery and a piece of wire and a bulb and say can you do it they could not do it right and that be no different from Imperial College in London by the way it be not some sort of anti American thing go on as if now the reason this matter be we pay lot and lot of money for teach person we might as well get it right and there be also some societal reason why we might want person to understand what it be that be happen in photosynthesis for example one half of the carbon equation be how much we emit and the other half of the carbon equation as I be very conscious as a trustee of Kew be how much thing soak up and they soak up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere that be what plant actually do for a live and for any Finnish person in the audience this be a Finnish pun we be both literally and metaphorically skate on thin ice if we do not understand that kind of thing now here be how you do the battery and the bulb it be so easy be not it of course you all know that but if you have not play with a battery and a bulb if you have only see a circuit diagram you might not be able to do that and that be one of the problem so why be it hot in summer than in winter we learn as child that you get close to something that be hot and it burn you it be a very powerful bit of learning and it happen pretty early on by extension we think to ourselves why it be hot in summer than in winter must be because we be close to the Sun I promise you that most of you will have get that oh you be all shake you head but only a few of you be shake you head very firmly other one be kind of go like this all right it be hot in summer than in winter because the ray from the Sun be spread out more right because of the tilt of the Earth and if you think the tilt be tilt we close no it be not the Sun be 93 million mile away and we be tilt like this right it make no odds in fact in the Northern Hemisphere we be further from the Sun in summer as it happen but it make no odds the difference ok now the scribble of the diagram of the solar system if you believe as most of you probably do that it be hot in summer than in winter because we be close to the Sun you must have draw a ellipse right that would explain it right except in you you be nod now in you ellipse have you think well what happen during the night between Australia and here right they have get summer and we have get winter and what do the Earth kind of rush towards the Sun at night and then rush back again I mean it be a very strange thing go on and we hold this two model in we head of what be right and what be not right and we do that as human being in all sort of field so here be Copernicus view of what the solar system look like as a plan that be pretty much what you should have on you piece of paper right and this be NASA view they be stunningly similar I hope you notice the coincidence here what would you do if you know that person have this misconception right in they head of elliptical orbit cause by we experience as child what sort of diagram would you show they of the solar system to show that it be not really like that you would show they something like this would not you it be a plan look down from above but no look what I find in the textbook that be what you show person right this be from textbook from website educational website and almost anything you pick up be like that and the reason it be like that be because it be dead boring to have a load of concentric circle whereas that be much more exciting to look at something at that angle be not it right and by do it at that angle if you have get that misconception in you head then that two dimensional representation of a three dimensional thing will be ellipsis so you have it be crap be not it really as we say so this mental model we look for evidence that reinforce we model we do this of course with matter of race and politics and everything else and we do it in science as well so we look just look and scientist do it constantly we look for evidence that reinforce we model and some folk be just all too able and willing to provide the evidence that reinforce the model so be I be in the United States I will have a dig at the European this be example of what I would say be bad practice in science teaching center this picture be from La Villette in France and the welcome wing of the Science Museum in London and if you look at the kind of the way this thing be construct there be a lot of mediation by glass and it be very blue and kind of professional in that way that you know Woody Allen come up from under the sheet in that scene in Annie Hall and say God that be so professional and that you do not there be no passion in it and it be not hand on right and you know pun intend whereas good interpretation I will use a example from nearby be San Francisco Exploratorium where all the thing that the demonstration and so on be make out of everyday object that child can understand it be very hand on and they can engage with and experiment with and I know that if the graduate at MIT and in the Imperial College in London have have the battery and the wire and the bit of stuff and you know be able to do it they would have learn how it actually work rather than think that they follow circuit diagram and can not do it so good interpretation be more about thing that be bodge and stuff and of my world right and thing that where there be not a extra barrier of a piece of glass or machined titanium and it all look fantastic ok and the Exploratorium do that really really well and it be amateur but amateur in the good sense in other word the root of the word be of love and passion so child be not empty vessel ok so as Monty Python would have it this be a bit Lord Privy Seal to say so but this be child be not empty vessel they come with they own idea and they own theory and unless you work with that then you will not be able to shift they right and I probably have not shift you idea of how the world and universe operate either but this apply equally to matter of try to sell new technology for example we be in Britain we be try to do a digital switchover of the whole population into digital technology for television and it be one of the difficult thing be that when person have preconception of how it all work it be quite difficult to shift that so we be not empty vessel the mental model that we have as child persist into adulthood poor teaching actually do more harm than good in this country and in Britain magnetism be understand good by child before they have be to school than afterwards ok same for gravity two concept so it be which be quite humbling as a you know if you be a teacher and you look before and after that be quite worrying they do bad in test afterwards after the teaching and we collude we design test or at least in Britain so that person pass they right and government do very well they pat themselves on the back ok we collude and actually if you if someone have design a test for I when I be do my biology exam to really understand to see whether I have understand more than just kind of put starch and iodine together and see it go blue and really understand that plant take they mass out of the air then I might have do well at science so the most important thing be to get person to articulate they model you homework be you know how do a aircraft wing create lift a obvious question and you will have a answer now in you head and the second question to that then be ensure you have explain how it be that plane can fly upside down ah ha right second question be why be the sea blue all right and you have all get a idea in you head of the answer so why be it blue on cloudy day ah see laughter I have always want to say that in this country laughter finally my plea to you be to allow yourselve and you child and anyone you know to kind of fiddle with stuff because it be by fiddle with thing that you you know you complement you other learning it be not a replacement it be just part of learn that be important thank you very much now oh oh yeah go on then go on applause
