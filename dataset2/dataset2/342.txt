person love they automobile they allow we to go where we want to when we want to they be a form of entertainment they be a form of art a pride of ownership song be write about car Prince write a great song Little Red Corvette he do not write little red laptop computer or little red dirt Devil he write about a car one of my favorite have always be make love to you man in a Chevy Van because that be my vehicle when I be in college the fact be when we do we market research around the world we see there be a nearly universal aspiration on the part of person to own a automobile 750 million person in the world today own a car and you say boy that be a lot but you know what that be just 12 percent of the population we really have to ask the question can the world sustain that number of automobile and if you look at projection over the next 10 to 15 to 20 year it look like the world car park could grow to on the order of 1 1 billion vehicle if you park that end to end and wrap they around the Earth that would stretch around the Earth 125 time now we have make great progress with automobile technology over the last 100 year car be dramatically clean dramatically safe more efficient and radically more affordable than they be 100 year ago but the fact remain the fundamental dna of the automobile have stay pretty much the same if we be to reinvent the automobile today rather than 100 year ago know what we know about the issue associate with we product and about the technology that exist today what would we do we want something that be really affordable the fuel cell look great one tenth as many move part a fuel cell propulsion system as a internal combustion engine and it emit just water and we want to take advantage of Moore Law with electronic control and software and we absolutely want we car to be connect so we embark upon the reinvention around a electrochemical engine the fuel cell and hydrogen as the energy carrier First be autonomy autonomy really set the vision for where we want to head we embody all of the key component of a fuel cell propulsion system we then have autonomy drivable with Hy Wire and we show Hy Wire here at this conference last year Hy Wire be the world first drivable fuel cell and we have follow up that now with sequel and sequel truly be a real car so if we could run the video futuristic music reinvent the automobile video it truly be my great pleasure to introduce Sequel Acceleration Cruising Steering Braking but the real key question I be sure that be on you mind where be the hydrogen go to come from and secondly when be this kind of car go to be available so let I talk about hydrogen first the beauty of hydrogen be it can come from so many different source it can come from fossil fuel it can come from any way that you can create electricity include renewable and it can come from biofuel and that be quite exciting the vision here be to have each local community play to its natural strength in create the hydrogen a lot of hydrogen be produce today in the world it be produce to get sulfur out of gasoline which I find be somewhat ironic it be produce in the fertilizer industry it be produce in the chemical manufacturing industry that hydrogen be be make because there be a good business reason for its use but it tell we that we know how to create it we know how to create it cost effectively we know how to handle it safely we do a analysis where you would have a station in each city with each of the 100 large city in the United States and locate the station so you would be no more than two mile from a station at any time we put one every 25 mile on the freeway and it turn out that translate into about 12 000 station and at a million dollar each that would be about 12 billion dollar that be a lot of money but if you build the alaskan pipeline today that be half of what the alaskan pipeline would cost but the real exciting vision that we see truly be home refuel much like recharge you laptop or recharge you cell phone so we be pretty excited about the future of hydrogen we think it be a question of not whether but a question of when what we have target for ourselves and we be make great progress toward this goal be to have a propulsion system base on hydrogen and fuel cell design and validate that can go head to head with the internal combustion engine we be talk about obsolete the internal combustion engine and do it in term of affordability at scale volume its performance and its durability so that be what we be drive to for 2010 we have not see anything yet in we development work that say that be not possible we actually think the future be go to be event drive so since we can not predict the future we want to spend a lot of we time try to create that future I be very very intrigued by the fact that we car and truck sit idle 90 percent of the time they be park all around we they be usually park within 100 foot of the person that own they now if you take the power generate capability of a automobile and you compare that to the electric grid in the United States it turn out that the power in four percent of the automobile equal that of the electric grid of the US that be a huge power generate capability a mobile power generate capability and hydrogen and fuel cell give we that opportunity to actually use we car and truck when they be park to generate electricity for the grid we talk about swarm network early talk about the ultimate swarm have all of the processor and all of the car when they be sit idle be part of a global grid for compute capability we find that premise quite exciting the automobile become then a appliance not in a commodity sense but a appliance mobile power mobile platform for information and computing and communication as well as a form of transportation and the key to all of this be to make it affordable to make it exciting to get it on a pathway where there be a way to make money do it and again this be a pretty big march to take here a lot of person say how do you sleep at night when you be wrestle with a problem of that magnitude I tell they I sleep like a baby I wake up cry every two hour laughter actually the theme of this conference I think have hit on one of the major key to pull that off and that be relationship and work together thank you very much applause Chris Anderson Larry Larry wait wait wait Larry wait one sec I have get so many question I could ask you I just want to ask one you know I could be wrong about this but my sense be that in the public mind today GM be not view as as serious about some of this environmental idea as some of you Japanese competitor maybe even as Ford be you serious about it and not just you know when the consumer want it when the regulator force we to do it we will go there will you guy really try and show leadership on this Larry Burns absolutely we be absolutely serious we be into this over a billion dollar already so I would hope person would think we be serious when we be spend that kind of money and secondly it be a fundamental business proposition I will be honest with you we be into it for business growth opportunity we can not grow we business unless we solve this problem the growth of the auto industry will be cap by sustainability issue if we do not solve the problem and there be a simple principle of strategy that say do unto yourself before other do unto you if we can see this possible future other can too and we want to be the first one to create it Chris
