the first idea I would like to suggest be that we all love music a great deal it mean a lot to we but music be even more powerful if you do not just listen to it but you make it yourself so that be my first idea and we all know about the Mozart effect the idea that be be around for the last five to 10 year that just by listen to music or by play music to you baby in utero that it will raise we iq point 10 20 30 percent great idea but it do not work at all so you can not just listen to music you have to make it somehow and I would add to that that it be not just make it but everybody each of we everybody in the world have the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way and that be one of the main part of my work so with the MIT Media Lab for quite a while now we have be engage in a field call active music what be all the possible way that we can think of to get everybody in the middle of a musical experience not just listen but make music and we start by make instrument for some of the world great performer we call this hyperinstrument for yo yo ma Peter Gabriel Prince orchestra rock band Instruments where they be all kind of sensor build right into the instrument so the instrument know how it be be play and just by change the interpretation and the feeling I can turn my cello into a voice or into a whole orchestra or into something that nobody have ever hear before when we start make this I start think why can not we make wonderful instrument like that for everybody person who be not fantastic yo yo ma or Princes so we have make a whole series of instrument one of the large collection be call the Brain Opera it be a whole orchestra of about 100 instrument all design for anybody to play use natural skill so you can play a video game drive through a piece of music use you body gesture to control huge mass of sound touch a special surface to make melody use you voice to make a whole aura and when we make the Brain Opera we invite the public to come in to try this instrument and then collaborate with we to help make each performance of the Brain Opera we tour that for a long time it be now permanently in Vienna where we build a museum around it and that lead to something which you probably do know Guitar Hero come out of we lab and my two teenage daughter and most of the student at the MIT Media Lab be proof that if you make the right kind of interface person be really interested in be in the middle of a piece of music and play it over and over and over again so the model work but it be only the tip of the iceberg because my second idea be that it be not enough just to want to make music in something like Guitar Hero and music be very fun but it be also transformative it be very very important music can change you life more than almost anything it can change the way you communicate with other it can change you body it can change you mind so we be try to go to the next step of how you build on top of something like Guitar Hero we be very involved in education we have a long term project call Toy Symphony where we make all kind of instrument that be also addictive but for little kid so the kid will fall in love with make music want to spend they time do it and then will demand to know how it work how to make more how to create so we make squeezy instrument like this music shaper that measure the electricity in you finger Beatbugs that let you tap in rhythm they gather you rhythm and like hot potato you send you rhythm to you friend who then have to imitate or respond to what you do and a software package call Hyperscore which let anybody use line and color to make quite sophisticated music extremely easy to use but once you use it you can go quite deep music in any style and then by press a button it turn into music notation so that live musician can play you piece we have have good enough really very powerful effect with kid around the world and now person of all age use hyperscore so we have get more and more interested in use this kind of creative activity in a much broad context for all kind of person who do not usually have the opportunity to make music so one of the grow field that we be work on at the Media Lab right now be music mind and health a lot of you have probably see Oliver Sacks wonderful new book call Musicophilia it be on sale in the bookstore it be a great book if you have not see it it be worth read he be a pianist himself and he detail he whole career of look at and observe incredibly powerful effect that music have have on people life in unusual situation so we know for instance that music be almost always the last thing that person with advanced Alzheimer can still respond to maybe many of you have notice this with love one you can find somebody who can not recognize they face in the mirror or can not tell anyone in they family but you can still find a shard of music that that person will jump out of the chair and start sing and with that you can bring back part of person memory and personality music be the good way to restore speech to person who have lose it through stroke movement to person with Parkinson disease it be very powerful for depression schizophrenia many many thing so we be work on understand that underlie principle and then build activity which will let music really improve person health and we do this in many way we work with many different hospital one of they be right near Boston call Tewksbury Hospital it be a long term state hospital where several year ago we start work with hyperscore and patient with physical and mental disability this have become a central part of the treatment at Tewksbury hospital so everybody there clamor to work on musical activity it be the activity that seem to accelerate person treatment the most and it also bring the entire hospital together as a kind of musical community I want to show you a quick video of some of this work before I go on Video they be manipulate each other rhythm it be a real experience not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythm but to train you musical memory and play music in a group to get they hand on music to shape it themselves change it to experiment with it to make they own music so Hyperscore let you start from scratch very quickly everybody can experience music in a profound way we just have to make different tool the third idea I want to share with you be that music paradoxically I think even more than word be one of the very good way we have of show who we really be I love give talk although strangely I feel more nervous give talk than play music if I be here play cello or play on a synth or share my music with you I would be able to show thing about myself that I can not tell you in word more personal thing perhaps deep thing I think that be true for many of we and I want to give you two example of how music be one of the most powerful interface we have from ourselves to the outside world the first be a really crazy project that we be build right now call death and the Powers and it be a big opera one of the large opera project go on in the world right now and it be about a man rich successful powerful who want to live forever so he figure out a way to download himself into he environment actually into a series of book so this guy want to live forever he download himself into he environment the main singer disappear at the beginning of the opera and the entire stage become the main character it become he legacy and the opera be about what we can share what we can pass on to other to the person we love and what we can not every object in the opera come alive and be a gigantic music instrument like this chandelier it take up the whole stage it look like a chandelier but it be actually a robotic music instrument so as you can see in this prototype gigantic piano string each string be control with a little robotic element either little bow that stroke the string propeller that tickle the string acoustic signal that vibrate the string we also have a army of robot on stage this robot be the kind of the intermediary between the main character Simon Powers and he family there be a whole series of they kind of like a Greek chorus they observe the action we have design this square robot that we be test right now at MIT call OperaBots this OperaBots follow my music they follow the character they be smart enough we hope not to bump into each other they go off on they own and then they can also when you snap line up exactly the way you would like to even though they be cube they actually have a lot of personality the large set piece in the opera be call the System it be a series of book every single book be robotic so they all move they all make sound and when you put they all together they turn into this wall which have the gesture and the personality of Simon Powers so he be disappear but the whole physical environment become this person this be how he be choose to represent himself the book also have high pack led on the spine so it be all display and here be the great baritone James Maddalena as he enter the System this be a sneak preview this premiere in Monaco it be in September 2009 if by any chance you can not make it another idea with this project here be this guy build he legacy through this very unusual form through music and through the environment but we be also make this available both online and in public space as a way of each of we to use music and image from we life to make we own legacy or to make a legacy of someone we love so instead of be grand opera this opera will turn into what we be think of as personal opera and if you be go to make a personal opera what about a personal instrument everything I have show you so far whether it be a hyper cello for yo yo ma or squeezy toy for a child the instrument stay the same and be valuable for a certain class of person a virtuoso a child but what if I could make a instrument that could be adapt to the way I personally behave to the way my hand work to what I do very skillfully perhaps to what I do not do so skillfully I think that this be the future of interface it be the future of music the future of instrument and I would like now to invite two very special person on the stage so that I can give you a example of what personal instrument might be like so can you give a hand to Adam Boulanger ph d student from the MIT Media Lab and Dan Ellsey Dan thanks to TED and to Bombardier Flexjet Dan be here with we today all the way from Tewksbury he be a resident at Tewksbury Hospital this be by far the farth he be stray from Tewksbury Hospital I can tell you that because he be motivate to meet with you today and show you he own music so first of all Dan do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you be Dan Ellsey Hello my name be Dan Ellsey I be 34 year old and I have cerebral palsy I have always love music and I be excited to be able to conduct my own music with this new software Tod Machover and we be really excited to have you here really Dan applause so we meet Dan about three year ago three and a half year ago when we start work at Tewksbury everybody we meet there be fantastic do fantastic music Dan have never make music before and it turn out he be really fantastic at it he be a bear composer he be very shy too so turn out he be a fantastic composer and over the last few year have be a constant collaborator of ours he have make many many piece he make he own cd actually he be quite well know in the Boston area mentor person at the hospital and child locally in how to make they own music and I will let Adam tell you so Adam be a ph d student at MIT a expert in music technology and medicine and Adam and Dan have become close collaborator what Adam be be work on for this last period be not only how to have Dan be able easily to make he own piece but how he can perform he piece use this kind of personal instrument so you want to say a little bit about how you guy work Adam Boulanger Yes so Tod and I enter into a discussion follow the Tewksbury work and it be really about how Dan be a expressive person and he be a intelligent and creative person and it be in he face it be in he breathing it be in he eye how come he can not perform one of he piece of music that be we responsibility and it do not make sense so we start develop a technology that will allow he with nuance with precision with control and despite he physical disability to be able to do that to be able to perform he piece of music so the process and the technology basically first we need a engineering solution so you know we have a FireWire camera it look at a infrared pointer we go with the type of gesture metaphor that Dan be already use to with he speak controller and this be actually the least interesting part of the work you know the design process we need a input we need continuous tracking in the software we look at the type of shape he be make but then be the really interesting aspect of the work follow the engineering part where basically we be code over Dan shoulder at the hospital extensively to figure out you know how do Dan move what be useful to he as a expressive motion you know what be he metaphor for performance what type of thing do he find important to control and convey in a piece of music so all the parameter fitting and really the technology be stretch at that point to fit just Dan and you know I think this be a perspective shift it be not that we technology they provide access they allow we to create piece of creative work but what about expression what about that moment when a artist deliver that piece of work you know do we technology allow we to express do they provide structure for we to do that and you know that be a personal relationship to expression that be lack in the technological sphere so you know with Dan we need a new design process a new engineering process to sort of discover he movement and he path to expression that allow he to perform and so that be what we will do today tm so let do it so Dan do you want to tell everyone about what you be go to play now de this be my Eagle Song tm so Dan be go to play a piece of he call my Eagle Song in fact this be the score for Dan piece completely compose by Dan in Hyperscore so he can use he infrared tracker to go directly into Hyperscore he be incredibly fast at it too fast than I be in fact laughter tm he be really modest too so he can go in Hyperscore you start out by make melody and rhythm he can place that exactly where he want each one get a color he go back into the composition window draw the line place everything the way he want to look at the Hyperscore you can see it also you can see where the section be something might continue for a while change get really crazy and then end up with a big bang at the end so that be the way he make he piece and as Adam say we then figure out the good way to have he perform he piece it be go to be look at by this camera analyze he movement it be go to let Dan bring out all the different aspect of he music that he want to and you be also go to notice a visual on the screen we ask one of we student to look at what the camera be measure but instead of make it very literal show you exactly the camera trace we turn it into a graphic that show you the basic movement and show the way it be be analyze I think it give a understanding of how we be pick out movement from what Dan do but I think it will also show you if you look at that movement that when Dan make music he motion be very purposeful very precise very disciplined and they be also very beautiful so in hear this piece as I mention before the most important thing be the music great and it will show you who Dan be so be we ready Adam AB yeah tm ok now Dan will play he piece my Eagle Song for you applause tm Bravo applause
