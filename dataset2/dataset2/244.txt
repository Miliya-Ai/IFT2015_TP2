that of you who know I know how passionate I be about open the space frontier so when I have the chance to give the world expert in gravity the experience of zero gravity it be incredible and I want to tell you that story I first meet he through the Archon X prize for Genomics it be a competition we be hold the second x prize for the first team to sequence 100 human genome in 10 day we have something call the genome 100 100 individual we be sequence as part of that Craig Venter chair that event and I meet Professor Hawking and he say he dream be to travel into space and I say I can not take you there but I can take you into weightlessness into zero g and he say on the spot absolutely yes well the only way to experience zero g on Earth be actually with parabolic flight weightless flight you take a airplane you fly over the top you be weightless for 25 second come back down you weigh twice as much you do it again and again you can get eight 10 minute of weightlessness how NASA train they astronaut for so long we set out to do this it take we 11 year to become operational and we announce that we be go to fly Stephen Hawking we have one government agency and one company aircraft operator say you be crazy do not do that you be go kill the guy laughter and he want to go we work hard to get all the permission and six month later we sit down at Kennedy Space Center we have a press conference we announce we intent to do one zero g parabola give he 25 second of zero g and if it go really well we might do three parabola well we ask he why he want to go up and do this and what he say for I be very move he say Life on Earth be at a ever increase risk of be wipe out by disaster I think the human race do not have a future if it do not go into space I therefore want to encourage public interest in space we take he out to the Kennedy Space Center up inside the NASA vehicle into the back of the zero g airplane we have about 20 person who make donation we raise 150 000 in donation for child charity who fly with we a few tedster here we set up a whole er we have four emergency room doctor and two nurse on board the airplane we be monitor he po2 of he blood he heart rate he blood pressure we have everything all set in case of a emergency God know you do not want to hurt this world renowned expert we take off from the shuttle land facility where the shuttle take off and land and my partner Byron Lichtenberg and I carefully suspend he into zero g once he be there we let he go to experience what weightlessness be truly like and after that first parabola you know the doc say everything be great he be smile and we say go so we do a second parabola laughter applause and a third applause we actually float a apple in homage to Sir Isaac Newton because Professor Hawking hold the same chair at Cambridge that Isaac Newton do and we do a fourth and a fifth and a sixth laughter and a seventh and a eighth and this man do not look like a 65 year old wheelchair bind man laughter he be so happy we be live on a precious jewel and it be during we lifetime that we be move off this planet please join we in this epic adventure thank you so much applause
