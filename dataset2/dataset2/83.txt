Nature my muse and it be be my passion as a photographer for National Geographic I have portray it for many but five year ago I go on a personal journey I want to visualize the story of life it be the hard thing I have ever attempt and there have be plenty of time when I feel like back out but there be also revelation and one of that I would like to share with you today I go down to a remote lagoon in Australia hope to see the Earth the way it be three billion year ago back before the sky turn blue there be stromatolite down there the first live thing to capture photosynthesis and it be the only place they still occur today go down there be like enter a time capsule and I come out with a different sense of myself in time the oxygen exhale by that stromatolite be what we all breathe today stromatolite be the hero in my story I hope it be a story that have some resonance for we time it be a story about you and I nature and science and with that say I would like to invite you for a short brief journey of life through time we journey start in space where matter condense into sphere over time solidify into surface mold by fire the fire give way Earth emerge but this be a alien planet the moon be close thing be different heat from within make geyser erupt that be how the ocean be bear Water freeze around the pole and shape the edge of the Earth Water be the key to life but in frozen form it be a latent force and when it vanish Earth become Mars but this planet be different it be roil inside and where that energy touch water something new emerge life it arise around crack in the Earth Mud and mineral become substrate there be bacterium learn to multiply thickening in place grow live structure under a alien sky Stromatolites be the first to exhale oxygen and they change the atmosphere a breath that be fossilize now as iron meteorite deliver chemistry and perhaps membrane too Life need a membrane to contain itself so it can replicate and mutate this be diatom single cell phytoplankton with skeleton of silicon circuit board of the future shallow sea nurture life early on and that be where it morph into more complex form it grow as light and oxygen increase life harden and become defensive it learn to move and begin to see the first eye grow on trilobite Vision be refine in horseshoe crab among the first to leave the sea they still do what they have do for age they enemy long go Scorpions follow prey out of the sea slug become snail Fish try amphibian life Frogs adapt to desert Lichens arise as a co op fungi married algae cling to rock and eat it too transform barren land true land plant arise leafless at first once they learn how to stay upright they grow in size and shape the fundamental form of fern follow to bear spore that foreshadow seed Life flourish in swamp on land life turn a corner Jaws form first tooth come later Leatherbacks and tuataras be echo from that era it take time for life to break away from water and it still beckon all the time life turn hard so it could venture inland and the dragon that arise be still among we today jurassic park still shimmer in part of Madagascar and the center of Brazil where plant call cycad remain rock hard forest arise and nurture thing with wing one early form leave a imprint like it die only yesterday and other fly today like echo of the past in bird life gain new mobility Flamingos cover continent migration get underway bird witness the emergence of flower plant Water lily be among the first plant begin to diversify and grow turn into tree in Australia a lily turn into a grass tree and in Hawaii a daisy become a silver sword in Africa Gondwana mold Proteas but when that ancient continent break up life get lusher Tropical rainforest arise spark new layer of interdependence fungi multiply Orchids emerge genitalium shape to lure insect a trick share by the large flower on Earth Co evolution entwine insect and bird and plant forever when bird can not fly they become vulnerable Kiwis be and so be this hawk trap near Antarctica extinction can come slowly but sometimes it arrive fast a asteroid hit and the world go down in flame but there be witness survivor in the dark when the sky clear a new world be bear a world fit for mammal from tiny shrew come tenrec accustom to the dark new form become bat civet new predator hyena get fast and fast still Grasslands create opportunity Herd safety come with sharpen sens grow big be another answer but size always come at a price some mammal turn back to water walruses adapt with layer of fat sea lion get sleek and cetacean move into a world without bound there be many way to be a mammal a roo hop in Oz a horse run in Asia and a wolf evolve stilt leg in Brazil Primates emerge from jungle as tarsier first become lemurs not much later learn become reinforce band of ape venture into the open and forest dry out once more go upright become a lifestyle so who be we Brothers of masculine chimp sister of feminine bonobo we be all of they and more we be mold by the same life force the blood vein in we hand echo a course of water trace on the Earth and we brain we celebrated brain reflect a drainage of a tidal marsh life be a force in its own right it be a new element and it have alter the Earth it cover earth like a skin and where it do not as in Greenland in winter Mars be still not very far but that likelihood fade as long as ice melt again and where water be liquid it become a womb for cell green with chlorophyll and that molecular marvel be what be make a difference it power everything the whole animal world today live on a stockpile of bacterial oxygen that be cycle constantly through plant and alga and they waste be we breath and vice versa this Earth be alive and it be make its own membrane we call it atmosphere this be the icon of we journey and you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next applause thank you thank you
