what I would like to do be just drag we all down into the gutter and actually all the way down into the sewer because I want to talk about diarrhea and in particular I want to talk about the design of diarrhea and when evolutionary biologist talk about design they really mean design by natural selection and that bring I to the title of the talk use evolution to Design Disease Organisms intelligently and I also have a little bit of a sort of smartass subtitle to this but I be not just do this to be cute I really think that this subtitle explain what somebody like I who be sort of a Darwin wannabe how they actually look at one role in sort of come into this field of health science and medicine it be really not a very friendly field for evolutionary biologist you actually see a great potential but you see a lot of person who be sort of defend they turf and may actually be very resistant when one try to introduce idea so all of the talk today be go to deal with two general question one be that why be some disease organism more harmful and a very closely related question which be how can we take control of this situation once we understand the answer to the first question how can we make the harmful organism more mild and I be go to be talk to begin with as I say about diarrheal disease organism and the focus when I be talk about the diarrheal organism as well as the focus when I be talk about any organism that cause acute infectious disease be to think about the problem from a germ point of view germ eye view and in particular to think about a fundamental idea which I think make sense out of a tremendous amount of variation in the harmfulness of disease organism and that idea be that from the germ eye point of view disease organism have to get from one host to another and often they have to rely on the well be of the host to move they to another host but not always sometimes you get disease organism that do not rely on host mobility at all for transmission and when you have that then evolutionary theory tell we that natural selection will favor the more exploitative more predator like organism so natural selection will favor organism that be more likely to cause damage if instead transmission to another host require host mobility then we expect that the winner of the competition will be the mild organism so if the pathogen do not need the host to be healthy and active and actual selection favor pathogen that take advantage of that host the winner in the competition be that that exploit the host for they own reproductive success but if the host need to be mobile in order to transmit the pathogen then it be the benign one that tend to be the winner so I be go to begin by apply this idea to diarrheal disease diarrheal disease organism get transmit in basically three way they can be transmit from person to person contact person to food then to person contact when somebody eat contaminate food or they can be transmit through the water and when they be transmit through the water unlike the first two mode of transmission this pathogen do not rely on a healthy host for transmission a person can be sick in bed and still infect ten even hundred of other individual to sort of illustrate that this diagram emphasize that if you have get a sick person in bed somebody be go to be take out the contaminate material they be go to wash that contaminate material and then the water may move into source of drinking water person will come in to that place where you have get contaminate drinking water bring thing back to the family may drink right at that point the whole point be that a person who can not move can still infect many other individual and so the theory tell we that when diarrheal disease organism be transport by water we expect they to be more predator like more harmful and you can test this idea so one way you can test be just look at all diarrheal bacterium and see whether or not the one that tend to be more transmit by water tend to be more harmful and the answer be yep they be now I put that name in there just for the bacterium buff but the main point here be that laughter there be a lot of they here I can tell the main point here be that that datum point all show a very strong positive association between the degree to which a disease organism be transmit by water and how harmful they be how much death they cause per untreated infection so this suggest we be on the right track but this to I suggest that we really need to ask some additional question remember the second question that I raise at the outset be how can we use this knowledge to make disease organism evolve to be mild now this suggest that if you could just block waterborne transmission you could cause disease organism to shift from the right hand side of that graph to the left hand side of the graph but it do not tell you how long I mean if this would require thousand of year then it be worthless in term of control of this pathogen but if it could occur in just a few year then it might be a very important way to control some of the nasty problem that we have not be able to control in other word this suggest that we could domesticate this organism we could make they evolve to be not so harmful to we and so as I be think about this I focus on this organism which be the El Tor biotype of the organism call Vibrio cholera and that be the species of organism that be responsible for cause cholera and the reason I think this be a really great organism to look at be that we understand why it be so harmful it be harmful because it produce a toxin and that toxin be release when the organism get into we intestinal tract it cause fluid to flow from the cell that line we intestine into the lumen the internal chamber of we intestine and then that fluid go the only way it can which be out the other end and it flush out thousand of different other competitor that would otherwise make life difficult for the Vibrios so what happen if you have get a organism it produce a lot of toxin after a few day of infection you end up have the fecal material really be not so disgusting as we might imagine it be sort of cloudy water and if you take a drop of that water you might find a million diarrheal organism if the organism produce a lot of toxin you might find 10 million or 100 million if it do not produce a lot of this toxin then you might find a small number so the task be to try to figure out how to determine whether or not you could get a organism like this to evolve towards mildness by block waterborne transmission thereby allow the organism only to be transmit by person to person contact or person food person contact both of which would really require that person be mobile and fairly healthy for transmission now I can think of some possible experiment one would be to take a lot of different strain of this organism some that produce a lot of toxin some that produce a little and take that strain and spew they out in different country some country that might have clean water supply so that you can not get waterborne transmission you expect the organism to evolve to mildness there other country in which you have get a lot of waterborne transmission there you expect this organism to evolve towards a high level of harmfulness right there be a little ethical problem in this experiment I be hope to hear a few gasp at least that make I worry a little bit laughter but anyhow the laughter make I feel a little bit well and this ethical problem a big problem just to emphasize this this be what we be really talk about here be a girl who be almost dead she get rehydration therapy she perk up within a few day she be look like a completely different person so we do not want to run a experiment like that but interestingly just that thing happen in 1991 in 1991 this cholera organism get into Lima Peru and within two month it have spread to the neighboring area now I do not know how that happen and I do not have anything to do with it I promise you I do not think anybody know but I be not averse to once that be happen to see whether or not the prediction that we would make that I do make before actually hold up do the organism evolve to mildness in a place like Chile which have some of the most well protect water supply in Latin America and do it evolve to be more harmful in a place like Ecuador which have some of the least well protect and Peru get something sort of in between and so with funding from the Bosack Kruger Foundation I get a lot of strain from this different country and we measure they toxin production in the lab and we find that in Chile within two month of the invasion of Peru you have strain enter Chile and when you look at that strain in the very far left hand side of this graph you see a lot of variation in the toxin production each dot correspond to a islet from a different person a lot of variation on which natural selection can act but the interesting point be if you look over the 1990 within a few year the organism evolve to be more mild they evolve to produce less toxin and to just give you a sense of how important this might be if we look in 1995 we find that there be only one case of cholera on average report from Chile every two year so it be control that be how much we have in America cholera that be acquire endemically and we do not think we have get a problem here they do not they solve the problem in Chile but before we get too confident we have good look at some of that other country and make sure that this organism do not just always evolve toward mildness well in Peru it do not and in Ecuador remember this be the place where it have the high potential waterborne transmission it look like it get more harmful in every case there be a lot of variation but something about the environment the person be live in and I think the only realistic explanation be that it be the degree of waterborne transmission favor the harmful strain in one place and mild strain in another so this be very encouraging it suggest that something that we might want to do anyhow if we have enough money could actually give we a much big bang for the buck it would make this organism evolve to mildness so that even though person might be get infected they would be infect with mild strain it would not be cause severe disease but there be another really interesting aspect of this and this be that if you could control the evolution of virulence evolution of harmfulness then you should be able to control antibiotic resistance and the idea be very simple if you have get a harmful organism a high proportion of the person be go to be symptomatic a high proportion of the person be go to be go to get antibiotic you have get a lot of pressure favor antibiotic resistance so you get increase virulence lead to the evolution of increase antibiotic resistance and once you get increase antibiotic resistance the antibiotic be not knock out the harmful strain anymore so you have get a high level of virulence so you get this vicious cycle the goal be to turn this around if you could cause a evolutionary decrease in virulence by clean up the water supply you should be able to get a evolutionary decrease in antibiotic resistance so we can go to the same country and look and see do Chile avoid the problem of antibiotic resistance whereas do Ecuador actually have the beginning of the problem if we look in the beginning of the 1990 we see again a lot of variation in this case on the y axis we have just get a measure of antibiotic sensitivity and I will not go into that but we have get a lot of variation in antibiotic sensitivity in Chile Peru and Ecuador and no trend across the year but if we look at the end of the 1990 just half a decade later we see that in Ecuador they start have a resistance problem antibiotic sensitivity be go down and in Chile you still have antibiotic sensitivity so it look like Chile dodge two bullet they get the organism to evolve to mildness and they get no development of antibiotic resistance now this idea should apply across the board as long as you can figure out why some organism evolve to virulence and I want to give you just one more example because we have talk a little bit about malaria and the example I want to deal with be or the idea I want to deal with the question be what can we do to try to get the malarial organism to evolve to mildness now malaria transmit by a mosquito and normally if you be infect with malaria and you be feel sick it make it even easy for the mosquito to bite you and you can show just by look at datum from literature that vector bear disease be more harmful than non vector bear disease but I think there be a really fascinating example of what one can do experimentally to try to actually demonstrate this in the case of waterborne transmission we would like to clean up the water supply see whether or not we can get that organism to evolve towards mildness in the case of malaria what we have like to do be mosquito proof house and the logic a little more subtle here if you mosquito proof house when person get sick they be sit in bed or in mosquito proof hospital they be sit in a hospital bed and the mosquito can not get to they so if you be a harmful variant in a place where you have get mosquito proof housing then you be a loser the only pathogen that get transmit be the one that be infect person that feel healthy enough to walk outside and get mosquito bite so if you be to mosquito proof house you should be able to get this organism to evolve to mildness and there be a really wonderful experiment that be do that suggest that we really should go ahead and do this and that experiment be do in Northern Alabama just to give you a little perspective on this I have give you a star at the intellectual center of the United States which be right there in Louisville Kentucky and this really cool experiment be do about 200 mile south of there in Northern Alabama by the Tennessee Valley Authority they have dam up the Tennessee River they have cause the water to back up they need electric hydroelectric power and when you get stagnant water you get mosquito they find in the late 30 10 year after they have make this dam that the person in Northern Alabama be infect with malaria about a third to half of they be infect with malaria this show you the position of some of this dam ok so the Tennessee Valley Authority be in a little bit of a bind there be not ddt there be not chloroquine what do they do well they decide to mosquito proof every house in Northern Alabama so they do they divide Northern Alabama into 11 zone and within three year about 100 dollar per house they mosquito proof every house and this be the datum every row across here represent one of that 11 zone and the asterisk represent the time at which the mosquito proofing be complete and so what you can see be that just the mosquito proof housing and nothing else cause the eradication of malaria and this be incidentally publish in 1949 in the lead textbook of malaria call Boyd Malariology but almost no malaria expert even know it exist this be important because it tell we that if you have moderate bite density you can eradicate malaria by mosquito proofing house now I would suggest that you could do this in a lot of place like you know just as you get into the malaria zone sub Saharan Africa but as you move to really intense biting rate area like Nigeria you be certainly not go to eradicate but that be when you should be favor evolution towards mildness so to I it be a experiment that be wait to happen and if it confirm the prediction then we should have a very powerful tool in a way much more powerful than the kind of tool we be look at because most of what be be do today be to rely on thing like anti malarial drug and we know that although it be great to make that anti malarial drug available at really low cost and high frequency we know that when you make they highly available you be go to get resistance to that drug and so it be a short term solution this be a long term solution what I be suggest here be that we could get evolution work in the direction we want it to go rather than always have to battle evolution as a problem that stymie we effort to control the pathogen for example with anti malarial drug so this table I have give just to emphasize that I have only talk about two example but as I say early this kind of logic apply across the board for infectious disease and it ought to because when we be deal with infectious disease we be deal with live system we be deal with live system we be deal with system that evolve and so if you do something with that system they be go to evolve one way or another and all I be say be that we need to figure out how they will evolve so that we need to adjust we intervention to get the most bang for the intervention buck so that we can get this organism to evolve in the direction we want they to go so I do not really have time to talk about that thing but I do want to put they up there just to give you a sense that there really be solution to control the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogen that we be confront with and this link up with a lot of the other idea that have be talk about so for example early today there be discussion of how do you really low sexual transmission of HIV what this emphasize be that we need to figure out how it will work will it maybe get lower if we alter the economy of the area it may get lower if we intervene in way that encourage person to stay more faithful to partner and so on but the key thing be to figure out how to lower it because if we lower it we will get a evolutionary change in the virus and the datum really do support this that you actually do get the virus evolve towards mildness and that will just add to the effectiveness of we control effort so the other thing I really like about this besides the fact that it bring a whole new dimension into the study of control of disease be that often the kind of intervention that you want that it indicate should be do be the kind of intervention that person want anyhow but person just have not be able to justify the cost so this be the kind of thing I be talk about if we know that we be go to get extra bang for the buck from provide clean water then I think that we can say let push the effort into that aspect of the control so that we can actually solve the problem even though if you just look at the frequency of infection you would suggest that you can not solve the problem well enough just by clean up water supply anyhow I will end that there and thank you very much applause
