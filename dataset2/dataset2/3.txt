if you be here today and I be very happy that you be you have all hear about how sustainable development will save we from ourselves however when we be not at TED we be often tell that a real sustainability policy agenda be just not feasible especially in large urban area like New York City and that be because most person with decision make power in both the public and the private sector really do not feel as though they be in danger the reason why I be here today in part be because of a dog a abandon puppy I find back in the rain back in 1998 she turn out to be a much big dog than I have anticipate when she come into my life we be fight against a huge waste facility plan for the East River waterfront despite the fact that we small part of New York City already handle more than 40 percent of the entire city commercial waste a sewage treatment pelletize plant a sewage sludge plant four power plant the world large food distribution center as well as other industry that bring more than 60 000 diesel truck trip to the area each week the area also have one of the low ratio of park to person in the city so when I be contact by the Parks Department about a 10 000 seed grant initiative to help develop waterfront project I think they be really well mean but a bit naive I have live in this area all my life and you could not get to the river because of all the lovely facility that I mention early then while jog with my dog one morning she pull I into what I think be just another illegal dump there be weed and pile of garbage and other stuff that I will not mention here but she keep drag I and lo and behold at the end of that lot be the river I know that this forget little street end abandon like the dog that bring I there be worth save and I know it would grow to become the proud beginning of the community lead revitalization of the new South Bronx and just like my new dog it be a idea that get big than I have imagine we garner much support along the way and the Hunts Point Riverside Park become the first waterfront park that the South Bronx have have in more than 60 year we leverage that 10 000 seed grant more than 300 time into a 3 million park and in the fall I be go to exchange marriage vow with my beloved audience whistle thank you very much applause that be he press my button back there which he do all the time laughter applause but that of we live in environmental justice community be the canary in the coal mine we feel the problem right now and have for some time Environmental justice for that of you who may not be familiar with the term go something like this no community should be saddle with more environmental burden and less environmental benefit than any other unfortunately race and class be extremely reliable indicator as to where one might find the good stuff like park and tree and where one might find the bad stuff like power plant and waste facility as a black person in America I be twice as likely as a white person to live in a area where air pollution pose the great risk to my health I be five time more likely to live within walk distance of a power plant or chemical facility which I do this land use decision create the hostile condition that lead to problem like obesity diabetes and asthma why would someone leave they home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood we 27 percent obesity rate be high even for this country and diabetes come with it one out of four South Bronx child have asthma we asthma hospitalization rate be seven time high than the national average this impact be come everyone way and we all pay dearly for solid waste cost health problem associate with pollution and more odiously the cost of imprison we young black and latino man who possess untold amount of untapped potential fifty percent of we resident live at or below the poverty line 25 percent of we be unemployed low income citizen often use emergency room visit as primary care this come at a high cost to taxpayer and produce no proportional benefit poor person be not only still poor they be still unhealthy fortunately there be many person like I who be strive for solution that will not compromise the life of low income community of color in the short term and will not destroy we all in the long term none of we want that and we all have that in common so what else do we have in common well first of all we be all incredibly good look laughter graduate high school college post graduate degree travel to interesting place do not have kid in you early teens financially stable never be imprison ok good laughter but besides be a black woman I be different from most of you in some other way I watch nearly half of the building in my neighborhood burn down my big brother Lenny fight in Vietnam only to be gun down a few block from we home Jesus I grow up with a crack house across the street yeah I be a poor black child from the ghetto this thing make I different from you but the thing we have in common set I apart from most of the person in my community and I be in between this two world with enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other so how do thing get so different for we in the late 40 my dad a Pullman porter son of a slave buy a house in the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx and a few year late he marry my mom at the time the community be a mostly white work class neighborhood my dad be not alone and as other like he pursue they own version of the American dream white flight become common in the South Bronx and in many city around the country red lining be use by bank wherein certain section of the city include ours be deem off limit to any sort of investment many landlord believe it be more profitable to torch they build and collect insurance money rather than to sell under that condition dead or injured former tenant notwithstanding Hunts Point be formerly a walk to work community but now resident have neither work nor home to walk to a national highway construction boom be add to we problem in New York State Robert Moses spearhead a aggressive highway expansion campaign one of its primary goal be to make it easy for resident of wealthy community in Westchester County to go to Manhattan the South Bronx which lie in between do not stand a chance resident be often give less than a month notice before they build be raze 600 000 person be displace the common perception be that only pimp and pusher and prostitute be from the South Bronx and if you be tell from you early day that nothing good be go to come from you community that it be bad and ugly how could it not reflect on you so now my family property be worthless save for that it be we home and all we have and luckily for I that home and the love inside of it along with help from teacher mentor and friend along the way be enough now why be this story important because from a planning perspective economic degradation beget environmental degradation which beget social degradation the disinvestment that begin in the 1960 set the stage for all the environmental injustice that be to come antiquated zoning and land use regulation be still use to this day to continue put pollute facility in my neighborhood be this factor take into consideration when land use policy be decide what cost be associate with this decision and who pay who profit do anything justify what the local community go through this be plan in quote that do not have we good interest in mind once we realize that we decide it be time to do we own plan that small park I tell you about early be the first stage of build a Greenway movement in the South Bronx I write a one and a quarter million dollar federal transportation grant to design the plan for a waterfront esplanade with dedicate on street bike path physical improvement help inform public policy regard traffic safety the placement of the waste and other facility which if do properly do not compromise a community quality of life they provide opportunity to be more physically active as well as local economic development think bike shop juice stand we secure 20 million dollar to build first phase project this be Lafayette Avenue and that be redesign by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects and once this path be construct it will connect the South Bronx with more than 400 acre of Randall Island Park Right now we be separate by about 25 foot of water but this link will change that as we nurture the natural environment its abundance will give we back even more we run a project call the Bronx Environmental Stewardship Training which provide job training in the field of ecological restoration so that folk from we community have the skill to compete for this well pay job little by little we be seed the area with green collar job and with person that have both a financial and personal stake in they environment the Sheridan Expressway be a underutilize relic of the Robert Moses era build with no regard for the neighborhood that be divide by it even during rush hour it go virtually unused the community create a alternative transportation plan that allow for the removal of the highway we have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholder to be envision how this 28 acre can be good utilize for parkland affordable housing and local economic development we also build New York City first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of we office cool roof be highly reflective surface that do not absorb solar heat and pass it on to the building or atmosphere green roof be soil and live plant both can be use instead of petroleum base roofing material that absorb heat contribute to urban heat island effect and degrade under the sun which we in turn breathe Green roof also retain up to 75 percent of rainfall so they reduce a city need to fund costly end of pipe solution which incidentally be often locate in environmental justice community like mine and they provide habitat for we little friend butterfly laughter so cool anyway the demonstration project be a springboard for we own green roof installation business bring job and sustainable economic activity to the South Bronx Green be the new black laughter applause I like that too anyway I know Chris tell we not to do pitch up here but since I have all of you attention we need investor end of pitch it be good to ask for forgiveness than permission anyway laughter applause ok Katrina Prior to Katrina the South Bronx and New Orleans Ninth Ward have a lot in common both be largely populate by poor person of color both hotbed of cultural innovation think hip hop and jazz both be waterfront community that host both industry and resident in close proximity of one another in the post Katrina era we have still more in common we be at well ignore and malign and abuse at bad by negligent regulatory agency pernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx be inevitable but we have emerge with valuable lesson about how to dig ourselves out we be more than simply national symbol of urban blight or problem to be solve by empty campaign promise of president come and go now will we let the Gulf Coast languish for a decade or two like the South Bronx do or will we take proactive step and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activist that have be bear of desperation in community like mine now listen I do not expect individual corporation or government to make the world a good place because it be right or moral this presentation today only represent some of what I have be through like a tiny little bit you have no clue but I will tell you later if you want to know laughter but I know it be the bottom line or one perception of it that motivate person in the end I be interested in what I like to call the triple bottom line that sustainable development can produce development that have the potential to create positive return for all concern the developer government and the community where this project go up at present that be not happen in New York City and we be operate with a comprehensive urban planning deficit a parade of government subsidy be go to propose big box and stadium development in the South Bronx but there be scant coordination between city agency on how to deal with the cumulative effect of increase traffic pollution solid waste and the impact on open space and they approach to local economic and job development be so lame it be not even funny because on top of that the world rich sport team be replace the House that Ruth build by destroy two well loved community park now we will have even less than that stat I tell you about early and although less than 25 percent of South Bronx resident own car this project include thousand of new parking space yet zip in term of mass public transit now what be miss from the large debate be a comprehensive cost benefit analysis between not fix a unhealthy environmentally challenge community versus incorporate structural sustainable change my agency be work closely with Columbia University and other to shine a light on this issue now let get this straight I be not anti development ours be a city not a wilderness preserve and I have embrace my inner capitalist and but I do not have laughter you probably all have and if you have not you need to laughter so I do not have a problem with developer make money there be enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable community friendly development can still make a fortune fellow tedster Bill McDonough and Amory Lovins both hero of mine by the way have show that you can actually do that I do have a problem with development that hyper exploit politically vulnerable community for profit that it continue be a shame upon we all because we be all responsible for the future that we create but one of the thing I do to remind myself of great possibility be to learn from visionary in other city this be my version of globalization let take Bogota poor latino surround by runaway gun violence and drug traffic a reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx however this city be bless in the late 1990 with a highly influential mayor name Enrique Pe alosa he look at the demographic few Bogotanos own car yet a huge portion of the city resource be dedicate to serve they if you be a mayor you can do something about that he administration narrow key municipal thoroughfare from five lane to three outlaw parking on that street expand pedestrian walkway and bike lane create public plaza create one of the most efficient bus mass transit system in the entire world for he brilliant effort he be nearly impeach but as person begin to see that they be be put first on issue reflect they day to day live incredible thing happen person stop litter crime rate drop because the street be alive with person he administration attack several typical urban problem at one time and on a third world budget at that we have no excuse in this country I be sorry but the bottom line be they person first agenda be not mean to penalize that who could actually afford car but rather to provide opportunity for all Bogotanos to participate in the city resurgence that development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population be still consider a radical idea here in the U S but Bogota example have the power to change that you however be bless with the gift of influence that be why you be here and why you value the information we exchange use you influence in support of comprehensive sustainable change everywhere do not just talk about it at TED this be a nationwide policy agenda I be try to build and as you all know politics be personal help I make green the new black help I make sustainability sexy make it a part of you dinner and cocktail conversation help I fight for environmental and economic justice support investment with a triple bottom line return help I democratize sustainability by bring everyone to the table and insist that comprehensive planning can be address everywhere oh good glad I have a little more time listen when I speak to Mr Gore the other day after breakfast I ask he how environmental justice activist be go to be include in he new marketing strategy he response be a grant program I do not think he understand that I be not ask for funding I be make he a offer applause what trouble I be that this top down approach be still around now do not get I wrong we need money laughter but grassroots group be need at the table during the decision make process of the 90 percent of the energy that Mr Gore remind we that we waste every day do not add waste we energy intelligence and hard earn experience to that count applause I have come from so far to meet you like this please do not waste I by work together we can become one of that small rapidly grow group of individual who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world we might have come to this conference from very very different station in life but believe I we all share one incredibly powerful thing we have nothing to lose and everything to gain Ciao bello applause
