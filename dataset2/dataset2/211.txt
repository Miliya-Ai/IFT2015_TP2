so as researcher something that we often do be use immense resource to achieve certain capability or achieve certain goal and this be essential to the progress of science or exploration of what be possible but it create this unfortunate situation where a tiny tiny fraction of the world can actually participate in this exploration or can benefit from that technology something that motivate I and get I really excited about my research be when I see simple opportunity to drastically change that distribution and make the technology accessible to a much wide percentage of the population I be go to show you two video that have get a lot of attention that I think embody this philosophy and they actually use the Nintendo Wii Remote for that of you who be not familiar with this device it be a 40 video game controller and it be mostly advertise for its motion sense capability so you can swing a tennis racket or hit a baseball bat but what actually interest I a lot more be the fact that in the tip of each controller be a relatively high perform infrared camera and I be go to show you two demo of why this be useful so here I have my computer set up with the projector and I have a Wii Remote sit on top of it and for example if you be in a school that do not have a lot money probably a lot of school or if you be in a office environment and you want a interactive whiteboard normally this cost about two to three thousand dollar so I be go to show you how to create one with a Wii Remote now this require another piece of hardware which be this infrared pen you can probably make this yourself for about five dollar with a quick trip to the Radio Shack it be get a battery a button and a infrared led you guy can not see it but it turn on whenever I push the button now what this mean be that if I run this piece of software the camera see the infrared dot and I can register the location of the camera pixel to the projector pixel and now this be like a interactive whiteboard surface applause so for about 50 of hardware you can have you own whiteboard this be Adobe Photoshop applause thank you laughter the software for this I have actually put on my website and have let person download it for free in the three month this project have be public it be be download over half a million time so teacher and student all around the world be already use this applause although it do do it for 50 dollar there be some limitation of this approach you get about 80 percent of the way there for one percent of the cost another nice thing be that a camera can see multiple dot so this be actually a multi touch interactive whiteboard system as well applause for the second demo I have this Wii Remote that be actually next to the tv so it be point away from the display rather than point at the display and why this be interesting be that if you put on say a pair of safety glass that have two infrared dot in they they be go to give the computer a approximation of you head location and why this be interesting be I have this sort of application run on the computer monitor which have a 3d room with some target float in it and you can see that it look like a 3d room kind of like a video game it sort of look 3d but for the most part the image look pretty flat and bound to the surface of the screen but if we turn on head track the computer can change the image that be on the screen and make it respond to the head movement so let switch back to that laughter applause so this have actually be a little bit startling to the game development community laughter because this be about 10 dollar of additional hardware if you already have a Nintendo Wii so I be look forward to see some game and actually Louis Castle that be he down there last week announce that Electronic Arts one of the large game publisher be release a game in May that have a little Easter egg feature for support this type of head track and that be from less than five month from a prototype in my lab to a major commercial product applause thank you applause but actually to I what be almost more interesting than either of this two project be how person actually find out about they YouTube have really change the way or change the speed in which a single individual can actually spread a idea around the world I be do some research in my lab with a video camera and within the first week a million person have see this work and literally within day engineer teacher and student from around the world be already post they own YouTube video of they use my system or derivative of this work so I hope to see more of that in the future and hope online video distribution to be embrace by the research community so thank you very much applause
