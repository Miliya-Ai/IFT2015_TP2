I do two thing I design mobile computer and I study brain today talk be about brain and audience member cheer Yay I have a brain fan out there laughter if I could have my first slide you will see the title of my talk and my two affiliation so what I be go to talk about be why we do not have a good brain theory why it be important that we should develop one and what we can do about it I will try to do all that in 20 minute I have two affiliation most of you know I from my palm and Handspring day but I also run a nonprofit scientific research institute call the Redwood Neuroscience Institute in Menlo Park we study theoretical neuroscience and how the neocortex work I be go to talk all about that I have one slide on my other life the computer life and that be this slide here this be some of the product I have work on over the last 20 year start from the very original laptop to some of the first tablet computer and so on end up most recently with the Treo and we be continue to do this I have do this because I believe mobile computing be the future of personal computing and I be try to make the world a little bit well by work on this thing but this be I admit all a accident I really do not want to do any of this product very early in my career I decide I be not go to be in the computer industry before that I just have to tell you about this picture of Graffiti I pick off the web the other day I be look for a picture for Graffiti that will text input language I find a website dedicate to teacher who want to make script write thing across the top of they blackboard and they have add Graffiti to it and I be sorry about that laughter so what happen be when I be young and get out of engineering school at Cornell in 79 I go to work for Intel and be in the computer industry and three month into that I fall in love with something else I say I make the wrong career choice here and I fall in love with brain this be not a real brain this be a picture of one a line draw and I do not remember exactly how it happen but I have one recollection which be pretty strong in my mind in September of 1979 scientific American come out with a single topic issue about the brain it be one of they good issue ever they talk about the neuron development disease vision and all the thing you might want to know about brain it be really quite impressive one might have have the impression we know a lot about brain but the last article in that issue be write by Francis Crick of dna fame today be I think the 50th anniversary of the discovery of dna and he write a story basically say this be all well and good but you know we do not know diddly squat about brain and no one have a clue how they work so do not believe what anyone tell you this be a quote from that article he say what be conspicuously lack he be a very proper British gentleman what be conspicuously lack be a broad framework of idea in which to interpret this different approach I think the word framework be great he do not say we do not have a theory he say we do not even know how to begin to think about it we do not even have a framework we be in the pre paradigm day if you want to use Thomas Kuhn so I fall in love with this I say look we have all this knowledge about brain how hard can it be it be something we can work on in my lifetime I could make a difference so I try to get out of the computer business into the brain business first I go to MIT the ai lab be there I say I want to build intelligent machine too but I want to study how brain work first and they say oh you do not need to do that you be just go to program computer that be all I say you really ought to study brain they say no you be wrong I say no you be wrong and I do not get in laughter I be a little disappointed pretty young but I go back again a few year late this time in California and I go to Berkeley and I say I will go in from the biological side so I get in the phd program in biophysic I be like I be study brain now well I want to study theory they say you can not study theory about brain you can not get fund for that and as a graduate student you can not do that so I say oh my gosh I be depress I say but I can make a difference in this field I go back in the computer industry and say I will have to work here for a while that be when I design all that computer product laughter I say I want to do this for four year make some money I be have a family and I would mature a bit and maybe the business of neuroscience would mature a bit well it take long than four year it be be about 16 year but I be do it now and I be go to tell you about it so why should we have a good brain theory well there be lot of reason person do science the most basic one be person like to know thing we be curious and we go out and get knowledge why do we study ant it be interesting maybe we will learn something useful but it be interesting and fascinating but sometimes a science have other attribute which make it really interesting sometimes a science will tell something about ourselves it will tell we who we be evolution do this and Copernicus do this where we have a new understanding of who we be and after all we be we brain my brain be talk to you brain we body be hang along for the ride but my brain be talk to you brain and if we want to understand who we be and how we feel and perceive we need to understand brain another thing be sometimes science lead to big societal benefit technology or business or whatever this be one too because when we understand how brain work we will be able to build intelligent machine that be a good thing on the whole with tremendous benefit to society just like a fundamental technology so why do not we have a good theory of brain person have be work on it for 100 year let first take a look at what normal science look like this be normal science normal science be a nice balance between theory and experimentalist the theorist guy say I think this be what be go on the experimentalist say you be wrong it go back and forth this work in physics this in geology but if this be normal science what do neuroscience look like this be what neuroscience look like we have this mountain of datum which be anatomy physiology and behavior you can not imagine how much detail we know about brain there be 28 000 person who go to the neuroscience conference this year and every one of they be do research in brain a lot of datum but no theory there be a little wimpy box on top there and theory have not play a role in any sort of grand way in the neuroscience and it be a real shame now why have this come about if you ask neuroscientist why be this the state of affair first they will admit it but if you ask they they say there be various reason we do not have a good brain theory some say we still do not have enough datum we need more information there be all this thing we do not know well I just tell you there be datum come out of you ear we have so much information we do not even know how to organize it what good be more go to do maybe we will be lucky and discover some magic thing but I do not think so this be a symptom of the fact that we just do not have a theory we do not need more datum we need a good theory another one be sometimes person say brain be so complex it will take another 50 year I even think Chris say something like this yesterday something like it be one of the most complicated thing in the universe that be not true you be more complicated than you brain you have get a brain and although the brain look very complicated thing look complicated until you understand they that be always be the case so we can say my neocortex the part of the brain I be interested in have 30 billion cell but you know what it be very very regular in fact it look like it be the same thing repeat over and over again it be not as complex as it look that be not the issue some person say brain can not understand brain very Zen like woo laughter you know it sound good but why I mean what be the point it be just a bunch of cell you understand you liver it be get a lot of cell in it too right so you know I do not think there be anything to that and finally some person say I do not feel like a bunch of cell I be conscious I have get this experience I be in the world I can not be just a bunch of cell well person use to believe there be a life force to be live and we now know that be really not true at all and there be really no evidence other than that person just disbelieve that cell can do what they do so some person have fall into the pit of metaphysical dualism some really smart person too but we can reject all that laughter no there be something else something really fundamental and it be another reason why we do not have a good brain theory be because we have a intuitive strongly hold but incorrect assumption that have prevent we from see the answer there be something we believe that just it be obvious but it be wrong now there be a history of this in science and before I tell you what it be I will tell you about the history of it in science look at other scientific revolution the solar system that be Copernicus Darwin evolution and tectonic plate that be Wegener they all have a lot in common with brain science first they have a lot of unexplained datum a lot of it but it get more manageable once they have a theory the good mind be stumped really smart person we be not smart now than they be then it just turn out it be really hard to think of thing but once you have think of they it be easy to understand my daughter understand this three theory in they basic framework in kindergarten it be not that hard here be the apple here be the orange the Earth go around that kind of stuff another thing be the answer be there all along but we kind of ignore it because of this obvious thing it be a intuitive strongly hold belief that be wrong in the case of the solar system the idea that the Earth be spin the surface be go a thousand mile a hour and it be go through the solar system at a million mile a hour this be lunacy we all know the Earth be not move do you feel like you be move a thousand mile a hour if you say Earth be spin around in space and be huge they would lock you up that be what they do back then so it be intuitive and obvious now what about evolution evolution same thing we teach we kid the Bible say God create all this species cat be cat dog be dog person be person plant be plant they do not change Noah put they on the ark in that order blah blah the fact be if you believe in evolution we all have a common ancestor we all have a common ancestor with the plant in the lobby this be what evolution tell we and it be true it be kind of unbelievable and the same thing about tectonic plate all the mountain and the continent be kind of float around on top of the Earth it do not make any sense so what be the intuitive but incorrect assumption that be keep we from understand brain I will tell you it will seem obvious that it be correct that be the point then I will make a argument why you be incorrect on the other assumption the intuitive but obvious thing be somehow intelligence be define by behavior we be intelligent because of how we do thing and how we behave intelligently and I be go to tell you that be wrong intelligence be define by prediction I be go to work you through this in a few slide and give you a example of what this mean here be a system engineer and scientist like to look at system like this they say we have a thing in a box we have its input and output the ai person say the thing in the box be a programmable computer because it be equivalent to a brain we will feed it some input and get it to do something have some behavior Alan Turing define the Turing test which essentially say we will know if something intelligent if it behave identical to a human a behavioral metric of what intelligence be that have stick in we mind for a long time reality though I call it real intelligence real intelligence be build on something else we experience the world through a sequence of pattern and we store they and we recall they when we recall they we match they up against reality and we be make prediction all the time it be a internal metric there be a internal metric about we say do we understand the world be I make prediction and so on you be all be intelligent now but you be not do anything maybe you be scratch yourself but you be not do anything but you be be intelligent you be understand what I be say because you be intelligent and you speak English you know the word at the end of this sentence the word come to you you make this prediction all the time what I be say be the internal prediction be the output in the neocortex and somehow prediction lead to intelligent behavior here be how that happen let start with a non intelligent brain I will argue a non intelligent brain we will call it a old brain and we will say it be a non mammal like a reptile say a alligator we have a alligator and the alligator have some very sophisticated sen it be get good eye and ear and touch sen and so on a mouth and a nose it have very complex behavior it can run and hide it have fear and emotion it can eat you it can attack it can do all kind of stuff but we do not consider the alligator very intelligent not in a human sort of way but it have all this complex behavior already now in evolution what happen first thing that happen in evolution with mammal be we start to develop a thing call the neocortex I be go to represent the neocortex by this box on top of the old brain neocortex mean new layer it be a new layer on top of you brain it be the wrinkly thing on the top of you head that get wrinkly because it get shove in there and do not fit laughter literally it be about the size of a table napkin and do not fit so it be wrinkly now look at how I have draw this the old brain be still there you still have that alligator brain you do it be you emotional brain it be all that gut reaction you have on top of it we have this memory system call the neocortex and the memory system be sit over the sensory part of the brain so as the sensory input come in and feed from the old brain it also go up into the neocortex and the neocortex be just memorize it be sit there say I be go to memorize all the thing go on where I have be person I have see thing I have hear and so on and in the future when it see something similar to that again in a similar environment or the exact same environment it will start play it back oh I have be here before and when you be here before this happen next it allow you to predict the future it literally feed back the signal into you brain they will let you see what be go to happen next will let you hear the word sentence before I say it and it be this feeding back into the old brain that will allow you to make more intelligent decision this be the most important slide of my talk so I will dwell on it a little and all the time you say oh I can predict thing so if you be a rat and you go through a maze and you learn the maze next time you be in one you have the same behavior but suddenly you be smart you say I recognize this maze I know which way to go I have be here before I can envision the future that be what it be do this be true for all mammal in human it get a lot bad human actually develop the front of the neocortex call the anterior part of the neocortex and nature do a little trick it copy the posterior the back part which be sensory and put it in the front human uniquely have the same mechanism on the front but we use it for motor control so we be now able to do very sophisticated motor plan thing like that I do not have time to explain but to understand how a brain work you have to understand how the first part of the mammalian neocortex work how it be we store pattern and make prediction let I give you a few example of prediction I already say the word sentence in music if you have hear a song before when you hear it the next note pop into you head already you anticipate it with a album at the end of a song the next song pop into you head it happen all the time you make prediction I have this thing call the alter door think experiment it say you have a door at home when you be here I be change it I have get a guy back at you house right now move the door around move you doorknob over two inch when you go home tonight you will put you hand out reach for the doorknob notice it be in the wrong spot and go whoa something happen it may take a second but something happen I can change you doorknob in other way make it large small change its brass to silver make it a lever I can change the door put color on put window in I can change a thousand thing about you door and in the two second you take to open it you will notice something have change now the engineering approach the ai approach to this be to build a door database with all the door attribute and as you go up to the door we check they off one at time door door color we do not do that you brain do not do that you brain be make constant prediction all the time about what will happen in you environment as I put my hand on this table I expect to feel it stop when I walk every step if I miss it by a eighth of a inch I will know something have change you be constantly make prediction about you environment I will talk about vision briefly this be a picture of a woman when we look at person we eye saccade over two to three time a second we be not aware of it but we eye be always move when we look at a face we typically go from eye to eye to nose to mouth when you eye move from eye to eye if there be something else there like a nose you would see a nose where a eye be suppose to be and go oh shit laughter there be something wrong about this person that be because you be make a prediction it be not like you just look over and say what be I see a nose ok no you have a expectation of what you be go to see every single moment and finally let think about how we test intelligence we test it by prediction what be the next word in this this be to this as this be to this what be the next number in this sentence here be three vision of a object what be the fourth one that be how we test it it be all about prediction so what be the recipe for brain theory First of all we have to have the right framework and the framework be a memory framework not a computational or behavior framework it be a memory framework how do you store and recall this sequence of pattern it be spatiotemporal pattern then if in that framework you take a bunch of theoretician biologist generally be not good theoretician not always but generally there be not a good history of theory in biology I have find the good person to work with be physicist engineer and mathematician who tend to think algorithmically then they have to learn the anatomy and the physiology you have to make this theory very realistic in anatomical term anyone who tell you they theory about how the brain work and do not tell you exactly how it be work and how the wiring work it be not a theory and that be what we do at the Redwood Neuroscience Institute I would love to tell you we be make fantastic progress in this thing and I expect to be back on this stage sometime in the not too distant future to tell you about it I be really excited this be not go to take 50 year what will brain theory look like First of all it be go to be about memory not like computer memory not at all like computer memory it be very different it be a memory of very high dimensional pattern like the thing that come from you eye it be also memory of sequence you can not learn or recall anything outside of a sequence a song must be hear in sequence over time and you must play it back in sequence over time and this sequence be auto associatively recall so if I see something I hear something it remind I of it and it play back automatically it be a automatic playback and prediction of future input be the desire output and as I say the theory must be biologically accurate it must be testable and you must be able to build it if you do not build it you do not understand it one more slide what be this go to result in be we go to really build intelligent machine absolutely and it be go to be different than person think no doubt that it be go to happen in my mind First of all we be go to build this stuff out of silicon the same technique we use to build silicon computer memory we can use here but they be very different type of memory and we will attach this memory to sensor and the sensor will experience real live real world datum and learn about they environment now it be very unlikely the first thing you will see be like robot not that robot be not useful person can build robot but the robotic part be the hard part that be old brain that be really hard the new brain be easy than the old brain so first we will do thing that do not require a lot of robotic so you be not go to see c 3po you be go to see thing more like intelligent car that really understand what traffic be what driving be and have learn that car with the blinkers on for half a minute probably be not go to turn laughter we can also do intelligent security system anytime we be basically use we brain but not do a lot of mechanic that be the thing that will happen first but ultimately the world the limit I do not know how this will turn out I know a lot of person who invent the microprocessor and if you talk to they they know what they be do be really significant but they do not really know what be go to happen they could not anticipate cell phone and the internet and all this kind of stuff they just know like we be go to build calculator and traffic light controller but it be go to be big in the same way brain science and this memory be go to be a very fundamental technology and it will lead to unbelievable change in the next 100 year and I be most excited about how we be go to use they in science so I think that be all my time I be over and I be go to end my talk right there
