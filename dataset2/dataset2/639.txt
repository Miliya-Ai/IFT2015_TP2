good morning happy to see so many fine folk out here and so many smile face I have a very peculiar background attitude and approach to the real world because I be a conjurer now I prefer that term over magician because if I be a magician that would mean that I use spell and incantation and weird gesture in order to accomplish real magic no I do not do that I be a conjurer who be someone who pretend to be a real magician laughter now how do we go about that sort of thing we depend on the fact that audience such as yourselve will make assumption for example when I walk up here and I take the microphone from the stand and switch it on you assume this be a microphone which it be not laughter as a matter of fact this be something that about half of you more than half of you will not be familiar with it be a beard trimmer you see and it make a very bad microphone I have try it many time laughter the other assumption that you make and this little lesson be to show you that you will make assumption not only that you can but that you will when they be properly suggest to you you believe I be look at you wrong I be not look at you I can not see you I know you be out there they tell I backstage it be a full house and such I know you be there because I can hear you but I can not see you because I normally wear glass this be not glass this be empty frame laughter quite empty frame now why would a grown man appear before you wear empty frame on he face to fool you lady and gentleman to deceive you to show that you too can make assumption do not you ever forget that now I have to do something first of all switch to real glass so I can actually see you which would probably be a convenience I do not know I have not have a good look well it be not that great a convenience laughter I have to do something now which seem a little bit strange for a magician but I be go to take some medication this be a full bottle of Calms Forte I will explain that in just a moment ignore the instruction that be what the government have to put in there to confuse you I be sure I will take enough of this Mm indeed the whole container thirty two tablet of Calms Forte now that I have do that I will explain it in a moment I must tell you that I be a actor I be a actor who play a specific part I play the part of a magician a wizard if you will a real wizard if someone be to appear on this stage in front of I and actually claim to be a ancient prince of Denmark name Hamlet you would be insult and rightly so why would a man assume that you would believe something bizarre like this but there exist out there a very large population of person who will tell you that they have psychic magical power that they can predict the future that they can make contact with the deceased oh they also say they will sell you astrology or other fortunetelling method oh they gladly sell you that yes and they also say that they can give you perpetual motion machine and free energy system they claim to be psychic or sensitive whatever they can but the one thing that have make a big comeback just recently be this business of speak with the dead now to my innocent mind dead imply incapable of communicate laughter you might agree with I on that but this person they tend to tell you that not only can they communicate with the dead hi there but they can hear the dead as well and they can relay this information back to the living I wonder if that be true I do not think so because this subculture of person use exactly the same gimmick that we magician do exactly the same the same physical method the same psychological method and they effectively and profoundly deceive million of person around the earth to they detriment they deceive this person cost they a lot of money cost they a lot of emotional anguish billion of dollar be spend every year all over the globe on this charlatan now I have two question I would like to ask this person if I have the opportunity to do so first question if I want to ask they to call up because they do hear they through the ear they listen to the spirit like this I be go to ask you to call up the ghost of my grandmother because when she die she have the family will and she secrete it someplace we do not know where it be so we ask Granny where be the will Granny what do Granny say she say I be in heaven and it be wonderful I be here with all my old friend my deceased friend and my family and all the puppy dog and the kitten that I use to have when I be a little girl and I love you and I will always be with you good bye and she do not answer the damn question where be the will now she could easily have say oh it be in the library on the second shelf behind the encyclopedia but she do not say that no she do not she do not bring any useful information to we we pay a lot of money for that information be we do not get it the second question that I have like to ask rather simple suppose I ask they to contact the spirit of my deceased father in law as a example why do they insist on say remember they speak into this ear why do they say my name start with j or m be this a hunting game Hunting and fishing what be it be it 20 question no it be more like 120 question but it be a cruel vicious absolutely conscienceless I will be all right keep you seat laughter game that this person play and they take advantage of the innocent the naive the grieving the needy person out there now this be a process that be call cold reading there be one fellow out there Van Praagh be he name James Van Praagh he be one of the big practitioner of this sort of thing John Edward Sylvia Browne and Rosemary Altea they be other operator there be hundred of they all over the earth but in this country James Van Praagh be very big and what do he do he like to tell you how the deceased get decease the person he be talk to through he ear you see so what he say be very often be like this he say he tell I he tell I before he pass that he have trouble breathe folk that be what die be all about laughter you stop breathe and then you be dead it be that simple and that be the kind of information they be go to bring back to you I do not think so now this person will make guess they will say thing like why be I get electricity he be say to I electricity be he a electrician no do he ever have a electric razor no it be a game of hunt question like this this be what they go through now folk often ask we at the James Randi Educational Foundation they call I they say why be you so concerned about this Mr Randi be not it just a lot of fun no it be not fun it be a cruel farce now it may bring a certain amount of comfort but that comfort last only about 20 minute or so and then the person look in the mirror and they say I just pay a lot of money for that reading and what do she say to I I love you they always say that they do not get any information they do not get any value for what they spend now Sylvia Browne be the big operator we call she the Talons Sylvia Browne thank you Sylvia Browne be the big operator in this field at this very moment now Sylvia Browne just to show you she actually get 700 dollar for a 20 minute reading over the telephone she do not even go there in person and you have to wait up to two year because she be book ahead that amount of time you pay by credit card or whatever and then she will call you sometime in the next two year you can tell it be she hello this be Sylvia Browne that be she you can tell right away now Montel Williams be a intelligent man we all know who he be on television he be well educate he be smart he know what Sylvia Browne be do but he do not give a damn he just do not care because the bottom line be the sponsor love it and he will expose she to television publicity all the time now what do Sylvia Browne give you for that 700 dollar she give you the name of you guardian angel that first now without that how could we possibly function laughter she give you the name of previous life who you be in previous life duh it turn out that the woman that she give reading for be all babylonian princess or something like that and the man be all Grecian warrior fight with Agamemnon nothing be ever say about a 14 year old bootblack in the street of London who die of consumption he be not worth bring back obviously and the strange thing folk you may have notice this too you see this folk on television they never call anybody back from hell laughter everyone come back from heaven but never from hell if they call back any of my friend they be not go to well you see the story laughter now Sylvia Browne be a exception a exception in one way because the James Randi Educational Foundation my foundation offer a one million dollar prize in negotiable bond very simply win all you have to do be prove any paranormal occult or supernatural event or power of any kind under proper observe condition it be very easy win the million dollar Sylvia Browne be a exception in that she be the only professional psychic in the whole world that have accept we challenge she do this on the Larry King live show on CNN six and a half year ago and we have not hear from she since strange she say that first of all that she do not know how to contact I duh a professional psychic who speak to dead person she can not reach I laughter I be alive you may have notice well pretty well anyway she could not reach I now she say she do not want to reach I because I be a godless person all the more reason to take the million dollar would not you think Sylvia now this person need to be stop seriously now they need to be stop because this be a cruel farce we get person come to the foundation all the time they be ruin financially and emotionally because they have give they money and they faith to this person now I pop some pill early I have to explain that to you Homeopathy let find out what that be all about hmm you have hear of it it be a alternative form of healing right homeopathy actually consist and that be what this be this be Calms Forte 32 caplet of sleep pill I forget to tell you that I just ingest six and a half day worth of sleep pill laughter six and a half day that certainly be a fatal dose it say right on the back here in case of overdose contact you poison control center immediately and it give a 800 number keep you seat it be go to be okay I do not really need it because I have be do this stunt for audience all over the world for the last eight or 10 year take fatal dose of homeopathic sleeping pill why do not they affect I laughter applause the answer may surprise you what be homeopathy it be take a medicine that really work and dilute it down well beyond Avogadro limit dilute it down to the point where there be none of it leave laughter now folk this be not just a metaphor I be go to give you now it be true it be exactly equivalent to take one 325 milligram aspirin tablet throw it into the middle of Lake Tahoe and then stir it up obviously with a very big stick and wait two year or so until the solution be homogeneous then when you get a headache you take a sip of this water and voila it be gone laughter now that be true that be what homeopathy be all about and another claim that they make you will love this one the more dilute the medicine be they say the more powerful it be now wait a minute we hear about a guy in Florida the poor man he be on homeopathic medicine he die of a overdose he forget to take he pill laughter work on it work on it it be a ridiculous thing it be absolutely ridiculous I do not know what we be do believe in all this nonsense over all this year now let I tell you the James Randi Educational Foundation be wave this very big carrot but I must say the fact that nobody have take we up on this offer do not mean that the power do not exist they might some place out there maybe this person be just independently wealthy well with Sylvia Browne I would think so you know 700 dollar for a 20 minute reading over the telephone that be more than lawyer make I mean that be a fabulous amount of money this person do not need the million dollar perhaps but would not you think they would like to take it just to make I look silly just to get rid of this godless person out there that Sylvia Browne talk about all the time I think that something need to be do about this we really would love to have suggestion from you folk on how to contact federal state and local authority to get they to do something if you find out now I understand we have see person even today speak to we about AIDS epidemic and starve kid around the world and impure water supply that person have to suffer with that be very important critically important to we and we must do something about that problem but at the same time as Arthur C Clarke say the rot of the human mind the business of believe in the paranormal and the occult and the supernatural all of this total nonsense this medieval thinking I think something should be do about that and it all lie in education largely it be the media who be to blame for this sort of thing they shamelessly promote all kind of nonsense of this sort because it please the sponsor it be the bottom line the dollar line that be what they be look at we really must do something about this I be willing to take you suggestion and I be willing to have you tune in to we webpage it be www randi org go in there and look at the archive and you will begin to understand much more of what I have be talk about today you will see the record that we have there be nothing like sit in that library and have a family appear there and say that Mum give away all the family fortune she cash in the cd she give away the stock and the certificate that be really sad to hear and it have not help they one bit have not solve any of they problem yes there could be a rot of the American mind and of the mind all the way around the earth if we do not start to think sensibly about this thing now we have offer this carrot as I say we have dangle the carrot we be wait for the psychic to come forth and snap at it oh we get lot of they hundred of they every year come by this be dowser and person who think that they can talk to the dead as well but they be amateur they do not know how to evaluate they own so call power the professional never come near we except in that case of Sylvia Browne that I tell you about a moment ago she do accept and then back away lady and gentleman I be James Randi and I be wait thank you applause
