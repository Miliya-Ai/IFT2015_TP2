in my industry we believe that image can change the world okay we be naive we be bright eyed and bushy tail the truth be that we know that the image themselves do not change the world but we be also aware that since the beginning of photography image have provoke reaction in person and that reaction have cause change to happen so let begin with a group of image I would be extremely surprised if you do not recognize many or most of they they be good describe as iconic so iconic perhaps they be cliche in fact they be so well know that you might even recognize they in a slightly or somewhat different form laughter but I think we be look for something more we be look for something more we be look for image that shine a uncompromising light on crucial issue image that transcend border that transcend religion image that provoke we to step up and do something in other word to act well this image you have all see it change we view of the physical world we have never see we planet from this perspective before many person credit a lot of the birth of the environmental movement to we see the planet like this for the first time its smallness its fragility forty year late this group more than most be well aware of the destructive power that we species can wield over we environment and at last we appear to be do something about it this destructive power take many different form for example this image take by Brent Stirton in the Congo this gorilla be murder some would even say crucify and unsurprisingly they spark international outrage most recently we have be tragically remind of the destructive power of nature itself with the recent earthquake in Haiti well I think what be far bad be man destructive power over man Samuel Pisar a Auschwitz survivor say and I will quote he the Holocaust teach we that nature even in its cruel moment be benign in comparison with man when he lose he moral compass and he reason there be another kind of crucifixion the horrifying image from Abu Ghraib as well as the image from Guantanamo have a profound impact the publication of that image as oppose to the image themselves cause a government to change its policy some would argue that it be that image that do more to fuel the insurgency in Iraq than virtually any other single act furthermore that image forever remove the so call moral high ground of the occupy force let go back a little in the 1960 and 1970 the Vietnam War be basically show in America live room day in day out News photo bring person face to face with the victim of the war a little girl burn by napalm a student kill by the National Guard at Kent State University in Ohio during a protest in fact this image become the voice of protest themselves now image have power to shed light of understanding on suspicion ignorance and in particular I have give a lot of talk on this but I will just show one image the issue of HIV AIDS in the 1980 the stigmatization of person with the disease be a enormous barrier to even discuss or address it a simple act in 1987 of the most famous woman in the world the Princess of Wales touch a HIV AIDS infect baby do a great deal especially in Europe to stop that she good than most know the power of a image so when we be confront by a powerful image we all have a choice we can look away or we can address the image thankfully when this photo appear in the Guardian in 1998 they put a lot of focus and attention and in the end a lot of money towards the Sudan famine relief effort do the image change the world no but they have a major impact image often push we to question we core belief and we responsibility to each other we all see that image after Katrina and I think for million of person they have a very strong impact and I think it be very unlikely that they be far from the mind of American when they go to vote in November 2008 unfortunately some very important image be deem too graphic or disturbing for we to see they I will show you one photo here and it be a photo by Eugene Richards of a Iraq War veteran from a extraordinary piece of work which have never be publish call war be personal but image do not need to be graphic in order to remind we of the tragedy of war John Moore set up this photo at Arlington Cemetery after all the tense moment of conflict in all the conflict zone of the world there be one photograph from a much quiet place that haunt I still much more than the other Ansel Adams say and I be go to disagree with he you do not take a photograph you make it in my view it be not the photographer who make the photo it be you we bring to each image we own value we own belief system and as a result of that the image resonate with we my company have 70 million image I have one image in my office here it be I hope that the next time you see a image that spark something in you you will well understand why and I know that speak to this audience you will definitely do something about it and thank you to all the photographer applause
