so I be go to talk today about collect story in some unconventional way this be a picture of I from a very awkward stage in my life you might enjoy the awkwardly tight cut off pajama bottom with balloon anyway it be a time when I be mainly interested in collect imaginary story so this be a picture of I hold one of the first watercolor painting I ever make and recently I have be much more interested in collect story from reality so real story and specifically I be interested in collect my own story story from the internet and then recently story from life which be kind of a new area of work that I have be do recently so I will be talk about each of that today so first of all my own story this be two of my sketchbook I have many of this book and I have be keep they for about the last eight or nine year they accompany I wherever I go in my life and I fill they with all sort of thing record of my lived experience so watercolor painting drawing of what I see dead flower dead insect paste ticket stub rusting coin business card writings and in this book you can find this short little glimpse of moment and experience and person that I meet and you know after keep this book for a number of year I start to become very interested in collect not only my own personal artifact but also the artifact of other person so I start collect find object this be a photograph I find lie in a gutter in New York City about 10 year ago on the front you can see the tattered black and white photo of a woman face and on the back it say to Judy the girl with the Bill Bailey voice have fun in whatever you do and I really love this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody life as oppose to know the whole story just know a little bit of the story and then let you own mind fill in the rest and that idea of a partial glimpse be something that will come back in a lot of the work I will be show later today so around this time I be study computer science at Princeton University and I notice that it be suddenly possible to collect this sort of personal artifact not just from street corner but also from the internet and that suddenly person en masse be leave score and score of digital footprint online that tell story of they private life Blog post photograph thought feeling opinion all of this thing be be express by person online and leave behind trail so I start to write computer program that study very very large set of this online footprint one such project be about a year and a half old it be call we feel fine this be a project that scan the world newly post blog entry every two or three minute search for occurrence of the phrase I feel and I be feel and when it find one of that phrase it grab the full sentence up to the period and also try to identify demographic information about the author so they gender they age they geographic location and what the weather condition be like when they write that sentence it collect about 20 000 such sentence a day and it be be run for about a year and a half have collect over 10 and a half million feeling now this be then how they be present this dot here represent some of the English speaking world feeling from the last few hour each dot be a single sentence state by a single blogger and the color of each dot correspond to the type of feel inside so the bright one be happy and the dark one be sad and the diameter of each dot correspond to the length of the sentence inside so the small one be short and the big one be long I feel fine with the body I be in there will be no easy excuse for why I still feel uncomfortable be close to my boyfriend from a twenty two year old in Japan I get this on some trading locally but really do not feel like screw with wiring and crap also some of the feeling contain photograph in the blog post and when that happen this montage composition be automatically create which consist of the sentence and image be combine and any of this can be open up to reveal the sentence inside I feel good I feel rough now and I probably gain 100 000 pound but it be worth it I love how they be able to preserve most in everything that make you feel close to nature butterfly man make forest limestone cave and hey even a huge python so the next movement be call mob this provide a slightly more statistical look at thing this be show the world most common feeling overall right now dominate by good then bad then good then guilty and so on Weather cause the feeling to assume the physical trait of the weather they represent so the sunny one swirl around the cloudy one float along the rainy one fall down and the snowy one flutter to the ground you can also stop a raindrop and open the feeling inside finally location cause the feeling to move to they spot on a world map give you a sense of they geographic distribution so I will show you now some of my favorite montage from we feel fine this be the image that be automatically construct I feel like I be diagonally park in a parallel universe laughter I have kiss numerous other boy and it have not feel good the kiss feel messy and wrong but kiss Lucas feel beautiful and almost spiritual I can feel my cancer grow I feel pretty I feel skinny but I be not I be 23 and a recover meth and heroin addict and feel absolutely bless to still be alive I can not wait to see they race for the first time at Daytona next month because I feel the need for speed laughter I feel sassy I feel so sexy in this new wig as you can see we feel Fine collect very very small scale personal story sometimes story as short as two or three word so really even challenge the notion of what can be consider a story and recently I have become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story and that be lead I to do some work with the physical world not with the internet and only use the internet at the very last moment as a presentation medium so this be some new project that actually be not even launch publicly yet the first such one be call the Whale Hunt Last May I spend nine day live up in Barrow Alaska the northernmost settlement in the United States with a family of Inupiat Eskimos document they annual spring whale hunt this be the whaling camp here we be about six mile from shore camping on five and a half foot of thick frozen pack ice and that water that you see there be the open lead and through that lead bowhead whale migrate north each springtime and the Eskimo community basically camp out on the edge of the ice here wait for a whale to come close enough to attack and when it do it throw a harpoon at it and then haul the whale up under the ice and cut it up and that would provide the community food supply for a long time so I go up there and I live with this guy out in they whaling camp here and photograph the entire experience begin with the taxi ride to Newark airport in New York and end with the butchering of the second whale seven and a half day later I photograph that entire experience at five minute interval so every five minute I take a photograph when I be awake with the camera around my neck when I be sleep with a tripod and a timer and then in moment of high adrenaline like when something exciting be happen I would up that photographic frequency to as many as 37 photograph in five minute so what this create be a photographic heartbeat that speed up and slow down more or less match the change pace of my own heartbeat that be the first concept here the second concept be to use this experience to think about the fundamental component of any story what be the thing that make up a story so story have character story have concept story take place in a certain area they have context they have color what do they look like they have time when do it take place date when do it occur and in the case of the whale hunt also this idea of a excitement level the thing about story though in most of the exist medium that we be accustomed to thing like novel radio photograph movie even lecture like this one we be very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position some kind of omniscient external body through whose eye you see the story we be very use to this but if you think about real life it be not like that at all I mean in real life thing be much more nuanced and complex and there be all of this overlap story intersect and touch each other and so I think it would be interesting to build a framework to surface that type of story so in the case of the Whale Hunt how could we extract something like the story of Simeon and Crawford involve the concept of wildlife tool and blood take place on the Arctic Ocean dominate by the color red happen around 10 a m on May 3 with a excitement level of high so how to extract this order of narrative from this large story I build a web interface for view the Whale Hunt that attempt to do just this so this be all 3 214 picture take up there this be my studio in Brooklyn this be the Arctic Ocean and the butchering of the second whale seven day later you can start to see some of the story here tell by color so this red strip signify the color of the wallpaper in the basement apartment where I be stay and thing go white as we move out onto the Arctic Ocean introduction of red down here when whale be be cut up you can see a timeline show you the exciting moment throughout the story this be organize chronologically Wheel provide a slightly more playful version of the same so this be also all the photograph organize chronologically and any of this can be click and then the narrative be enter at that position so here I be sleep on the airplane head up to Alaska that be Moby Dick this be the food we eat this be in the Patkotak family living room in they house in Barrow the box wine they serve we cigarette break outside I do not smoke this be a really exciting sequence of I sleep this be out at whale camp on the Arctic Ocean this graph that I be click down here be mean to be reminiscent of a medical heartbeat graph show the exciting moment of adrenaline this be the ice start to freeze over the snow fence they build and so what I will show you now be the ability to pull out sub story so here you see the cast this be all of the person in the Whale Hunt and the two whale that be kill down here and we could do something as arbitrary as say extract the story of Rony involve the concept of blood and whale and tool take place on the Arctic Ocean at Ahkivgaq camp with the heartbeat level of fast and now we have whittle down that whole story to just 29 matching photograph and then we can enter the narrative at that position and you can see Rony cut up the whale here this whale be about 40 foot long and weigh over 40 ton and they provide the food source for the community for much of the year skip ahead a bit more here this be Rony on the whale carcass they use no chainsaw or anything it be entirely just blade and a incredibly efficient process this be the guy on the rope pull open the carcass this be the muktuk or the blubber all line up for community distribution it be baleen move on so what I be go to tell you about next be a very new thing it be not even a project yet so just yesterday I fly in here from Singapore and before that I be spend two week in Bhutan the small himalayan kingdom nestle between Tibet and India and I be do a project there about happiness interview a lot of local person so Bhutan have this really wacky thing where they base most of they high level governmental decision around the concept of gross national happiness instead of gross domestic product and they have be do this since the 70 and it lead to just a completely different value system it be a incredibly non materialistic culture where person do not have a lot but they be incredibly happy so I go around and I talk to person about some of this idea so I do a number of thing I ask person a number of set question and take a number of set photograph and interview they with audio and also take picture I would start by ask person to rate they happiness between one and 10 which be kind of inherently absurd and then when they answer I would inflate that number of balloon and give they that number of balloon to hold so you have some really happy person hold 10 balloon and some really sad soul hold one balloon but you know even hold one balloon be like kind of happy laughter and then I would ask they a number of question like what be the happy day in they life what make they happy and then finally I would ask they to make a wish and when they make a wish I would write they wish onto one of the balloon and take a picture of they hold it so I be go to show you now just a few brief snippet of some of the interview that I do some of the person I speak with this be a 11 year old student he be play cop and robber with he friend run around town and they all have plastic toy gun he wish be to become a police officer he be get

of too shy to make a funny face a 16 year old student she want to become a independent woman I ask she about that and she say she mean that she do not want to be marry because in she opinion when you get marry in Bhutan as a woman you chance to live a independent life kind of end and so she have no interest in that a 24 year old truck driver there be this terrifyingly huge Indian truck that come careen around one lane road with two lane traffic with 3 000 foot drop off right next to the road and he be drive one of this truck but all he want be to just live a comfortable life like other person

travel from farm to farm each day try to find work and then he try to sleep at whatever farm he get work at so he wish be to come with I so that he have somewhere to live he have this amazing knife that he pull out of he gho and start brandish when I ask he to make a funny face it be all good natured a 10 year old he want to join a school and learn to read but he parent do not have enough money to send he to school he be eat this orange sugary candy that he keep dip he finger into and since there be so much saliva on he hand this orange paste start to form on he palm laughter a 37 year old

so this guy be in a worker gang mix up asphalt one morning on the side of the highway he wish be to make some money and open a store a 75 year old farmer she be sell orange on the side of the road I
