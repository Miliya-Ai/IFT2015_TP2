to be new at TED it be like be the last high school virgin laughter you know that all of the cool person be they be do it and you be on the outside you be at home you be like the Raspyni Brothers where you have get you ball in cold water and laughter you just play with you finger all day and then you get invite and you be on the inside and it be everything you hope it would be it be exciting and there be music play all of the time and then suddenly it be over and it be only take five minute and you want to go back and do it again but I really appreciate be here and thank you Chris and also thank you Deborah Patton for make this possible so anyway today we will talk about architecture a little bit within the subject of creation and optimism and if you put creation and optimism together you have get two choice that you can talk about you can talk about creationism which I think would not go down well with this audience at least not from a view where you be a proponent of it or you can talk about optimisation spell the British way with a s instead of a z and I think that be what I would like to talk about today but any kind of conversation about architecture which be in fact what you be just talk about what be go on here set up TED small scale architecture at the present time can not really happen without a conversation about this the World Trade Center and what be be go on there what it mean to we because if architecture be what I believe it to be which be the build form of we cultural ambition what do you do when present with a opportunity to rectify a situation that represent somebody else cultural ambition relative to we and we own opportunity to make something new there this have be a really galvanize issue for a long time I think that the World Trade Center in rather a unfortunate way bring architecture into focus in a way that I do not think person have think of in a long time and make it a subject for common conversation I do not remember in my 20 year career of practice and write about architecture a time when five person sit I down at a table and ask I very serious question about zoning fire exit safety concern and whether carpet burn this be just not thing we talk about very often and yet now it be talk about all the time at the point where you can weaponize you build you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way and so now we be go to think about architecture in a very different way we be go to think about it like this how many of you see USA Today today there it be look like that there be the World Trade Center site on the front cover they have make a selection they have choose a project by Daniel Libeskind the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture child prodigy piano player he start on the squeezebox and move to a little more serious issue a big instrument and now to a even large instrument upon which to work he particular brand of deconstructivist magic as you see here he be one of six person who be invite to participate in this competition after six previous firm strike out with thing that be so stupid and banal that even the city of New York be force to go oh I be really sorry we screw up right can we do this again from the top except use some person with a vague hint of talent instead of just six utter boob like we bring in last time real estate hack of the kind who usually plan we city let bring in some real architect for a change and so we get this or we have a choice of that oh stop clapping laughter it be too late that be go this be a scheme by a team call think a New York base team and then there be that one which be the Libeskind scheme this one this be go to be the new World Trade Center a giant hole in the ground with big building fall into it now I do not know what you think but I think this be a pretty stupid decision because what you have do be just make a permanent memorial to destruction by make it look like the destruction be go to continue forever but that be what we be go to do but I want you to think about this thing in term of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represent and that this two thing talk about very specifically and that be the wild divergence in how we choose we architect in try to decide whether we want architecture from the kind of technocratic solution to everything that there be a large technical answer that can solve all problem be they social be they physical be they chemical or something that be more of a romantic solution now I do not mean romantic as in this be a nice place to take someone on a date I mean romantic in the sense of there be thing large and grand than we so in the American tradition the difference between the technocratic and the romantic would be the difference between Thomas Jefferson cartesian grid spread across the United States that give we basically the whole shape of every western state in the United States as a really truly technocratic solution a bow to the in Jefferson time current popular philosophy of rationalism or the way we go to describe that later manifest destiny now which would you rather be a grid or manifest destiny manif destiny laughter it be a big deal it sound big it sound important it sound solid it sound American ballsy serious male and that kind of fight have go on back and forth in architecture all the time I mean it go on in we private life too every single day we all want to go out and buy a Audi tt do not we everyone here must own one or at least they crave one the moment they see one and then they hop in it turn the little electronic key rather than the real key zipped home on they new superhighway and drive straight into a garage that look like a Tudor castle laughter why why why do you want to do that why do we all want to do that I even own a Tudor thing once myself laughter it be in we nature to go ricochet back and forth between this technocratic solution and a large sort of more romantic image of where we be so we be go to go straight into this can I have the light off for a moment I be go to talk about two architect very very briefly that represent the current split architecturally between this two tradition of a technocratic or technological solution and a romantic solution and this be two of the top architectural practice in the United States today one very young one a little more mature this be the work of a firm call shop and what you be see here be they isometric drawing of what will be a large scale camera obscura in a public park do everybody know what a camera obscura be yeah it be one of that giant camera lens that take a picture of the outside world it be sort of a little movie without any move part and project it on a page and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it this be just the outline of it and you can see do it look like a regular building no it be actually non orthogonal it be not up and down square rectangular anything like that that you would see in a normal shape of a build the computer revolution the technocratic technological revolution have allow we to jettison normal shape build traditionally shape building in favor of non orthogonal building such as this what be interesting about it be not the shape what be interesting about it be how it be make how it be make a brand new way to put build together something call mass customization no it be not a oxymoron what make the building expensive in the traditional sense be make individual part custom that you can not do over and over again that be why we all live in developer house they all want to save money by build the same thing 500 time that be because it be cheap Mass customization work by a architect feeding into a computer a program that say manufacture this part the computer then talk to a machine a computer operate machine a cad cam machine that can make a zillion different change at a moment notice because the computer be just a machine it do not care it be manufacture the part it do not see any excess cost it do not spend any extra time it be not a laborer it be simply a electronic lathe so the part can all be cut at the same time meanwhile instead of send someone work drawing which be that huge set of blueprint that you have see you whole life what the architect can do be send a set of assembly instruction like you use to get when you be a child when you buy little model that say Bolt A to B and C to D and so what the builder will get be every single individual part that have be custom manufacture off site and deliver on a truck to the site to that builder and a set of this instruction manual just simple bolt a to b and they will be able to put they together here be the little drawing that tell they how that work and that be what will happen in the end you be underneath it look up into the lens of the camera obscura lest you think this be all fiction lest you think this be all fantasy or romance this same architect be ask to produce something for the central courtyard of ps1 which be a museum in Brooklyn New York as part of they young architect summer series and they say well it be summer what do you do in the summer you go to the beach and when you go to the beach what do you get you get sand dune so let make architectural sand dune and a beach cabana so they go out and they model a computer model of a sand dune they take photograph they feed the photograph into they computer program and that computer program shape a sand dune and then take that sand dune shape and turn it into at they instruction use standard software with slight modification a set of instruction for piece of wood and that be the piece of wood that be the instruction this be the piece and here be a little of that blow up what you can see be there be about six different color and each color represent a type of wood to be cut a piece of wood to be cut all of which be deliver by flat bed on a truck and hand assemble in 48 hour by a team of eight person only one of whom have ever see the plan before only one of whom have ever see the plan before and here come dune scape come up out of the courtyard and there it be fully build there be only 16 different piece of wood only 16 different assembly part here look like a beautiful piano sound board on the inside it have its own build in swim pool very very cool it be a great place for party it be it be only up for six week it be get little dressing room and cabana where lot of interesting thing go on all summer long now lest you think that this be only for the light at heart or just temporary installation this be the same firm work at the World Trade Center replace the bridge that use to go across West Street that very important pedestrian connection between the city of New York and the redevelopment of the West side they be ask to design replace that bridge in six week build it include all of the part manufacture and they be able to do it that be they design use that same computer modeling system and only five or six really different kind of part a couple of strut like this some exterior cladding material and a very simple frame system that be all manufacture off site and deliver by truck they be able to create that they be able to create something wonderful they be now build a 16 story building on the side of New York use the same technology here we be go to walk across the bridge at night it be self light you do not need any overhead lighting so the neighbor do not complain about metal halide lighting in they face here it be go across and there down the other side and you get the same kind of grandeur now let I show you quickly the opposite if I may woo pretty huh this be the other side of the coin this be the work of David Rockwell from New York City whose work you can see out here today the current king of the romantic who approach he work in a very different fashion it be not to create a technological solution it be to seduce you into something that you can do into something that will please you something that will lift you spirit something that will make you feel as if be in another world such as he Nobu restaurant in New York which be suppose to take you from the clutter of New York City to the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition when it be all say and do it be get to look like seaweed say the owner or he restaurant pod in Philadelphia Pennsylvania I want you to know the room you be look at be stark white every single surface of this restaurant be white the reason it have so much color be that it change use lighting it be all about sensuality it be all about transform watch this I be not touch any button lady and gentleman this be happen by itself it transform through the magic of light it be all about sensuality it be all about touch Rosa Mexicano restaurant where he transport we to the shore of Acapulco up on the Upper West side with this wall of cliff diver who there you go like that let see it one more time okay just to make sure that you have enjoy it and finally it be about comfort it be about make you feel good in place that you would not have feel good before it be about bring nature to the inside in the Guardian Tower of New York convert to a W Union Square I be sorry I be rush where we have to bring in the good horticulturist in the world to make sure that the interior of this drag the garden space of the court garden of the Union Square into the building itself it be about stimulation this be a wine buying experience simplify by color and taste fizzy fresh soft luscious juicy smooth big and sweet wine all explain to you by color and texture on the wall and finally it be about entertainment as in he headquarters for the Cirque du Soleil Orlando Florida where you be ask to enter the Greek theater look under the tent and join the magic world of Cirque du Soleil and I think I will probably leave it at that thank you very much
