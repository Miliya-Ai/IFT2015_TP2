the future that we will create can be a future that we will be proud of I think about this every day it be quite literally my job I be co founder and senior columnist at worldchange com Alex Steffen and I find worldchanging in late 2003 and since then we and we grow global team of contributor have document the ever expand variety of solution that be out there right now and on the near horizon in a little over two year we have write up about 4 000 item replicable model technological tool emerge idea all provide a path to a future that be more sustainable more equitable and more desirable we emphasis on solution be quite intentional there be ton of place to go online and off if what you want to find be the late bit of news about just how quickly we hell bind handbasket be move we want to offer person a idea of what they can do about it we focus primarily on the planet environment but we also address issue of global development international conflict responsible use of emerge technology even the rise of the so call second superpower and much much more the scope of solution that we discuss be actually pretty broad but that reflect both the range of challenge that need to be meet and the kind of innovation that will allow we to do so a quick sampling really can barely scratch the surface but to give you a sense of what we cover tool for rapid disaster relief such as this inflatable concrete shelter innovative use of bioscience such as a flower that change color in the presence of landmine ultra high efficiency design for home and office distribute power generation use solar power wind power ocean power other clean energy source ultra ultra high efficiency vehicle of the future ultra high efficiency vehicle you can get right now and good urban design so you do not need to drive as much in the first place bio mimetic approach to design that take advantage of the efficiency of natural model in both vehicle and building distribute compute project that will help we model the future of the climate also a number of the topic that we have be talk about this week at TED be thing that we have address in the past on worldchange cradle to cradle design MIT Fab Labs the consequence of extreme longevity the one laptop per child project even Gapminder as a bear in the mid 1960 Gen X er hurtle all too quickly to my fortieth birthday I be naturally incline to pessimism but work at Worldchanging have convince I much to my own surprise that successful response to the world problem be nonetheless possible moreover I have come to realize that focus only on negative outcome can really blind you to the very possibility of success as Norwegian social scientist Evelin Lindner have observe pessimism be a luxury of good time in difficult time pessimism be a self fulfil self inflict death sentence the truth be we can build a good world and we can do so right now we have the tool we see a hint of that a moment ago and we be come up with new one all the time we have the knowledge and we understanding of the planet improve every day most importantly we have the motive we have a world that need fixing and nobody be go to do it for we many of the solution that I and my colleague seek out and write up every day have some important aspect in common transparency collaboration a willingness to experiment and a appreciation of science or more appropriately science laughter the majority of model tool and idea on Worldchanging encompass combination of this characteristic so I want to give you a few concrete example of how this principle combine in world change way we can see world change value in the emergence of tool to make the invisible visible that be to make apparent the condition of the world around we that would otherwise be largely imperceptible we know that person often change they behavior when they can see and understand the impact of they action as a small example many of we have experience the change in drive behavior that come from have a real time display of mileage show precisely how one be drive habit affect the vehicle efficiency the last few year have all see the rise of innovation in how we measure and display aspect of the world that can be too big or too intangible or too slippery to grasp easily simple technology like wall mount device that display how much power you household be use and what kind of result you will get if you turn off a few light this can actually have a direct positive impact on you energy footprint community tool like text messaging that can tell you when pollen count be up or smog level be rise or a natural disaster be unfold can give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion datum rich display like map of campaign contribution or map of the disappear polar ice cap allow we to well understand the context and the flow of process that affect we all we can see world change value in research project that seek to meet the world medical need through open access to datum and collaborative action now some person emphasize the risk of knowledge enable danger but I be convince that the benefit of knowledge enable solution be far more important for example open access journal like the Public Library of Science make cut edge scientific research free to all everyone in the world and actually a grow number of science publisher be adopt this model last year hundred of volunteer biology and chemistry researcher around the world work together to sequence the genome of the parasite responsible for some of the develop world bad disease African sleep sickness leishmaniasis and Chagas disease that genome datum can now be find on open access genetic datum bank around the world and it be a enormous boon to researcher try to come up with treatment but my favorite example have to be the global response to the SARS epidemic in 2003 2004 which rely on worldwide access to the full gene sequence of the SARS virus the U S National Research Council in its follow up report on the outbreak specifically cite this open availability of the sequence as a key reason why the treatment for SARS could be develop so quickly and we can see world change value in something as humble as a cell phone I can probably count on my finger the number of person in this room who do not use a mobile phone and where be Aubrey because I know he do not laughter for many of we cell phone have really become almost a extension of ourselves and we be really now begin to see the social change that mobile phone can bring about you may already know some of the big picture aspect globally more camera phone be sell last year than any other kind of camera and a grow number of person live life mediate through the lens and over the network and sometimes enter history book in the develop world mobile phone have become economic driver a study last year show a direct correlation between the growth of mobile phone use and subsequent gdp increase across Africa in Kenya mobile phone minute have actually become a alternative currency the political aspect of mobile phone can not be ignore either from text message swarm in Korea help to bring down a government to the Blairwatch Project in the UK keep tab on politician who try to avoid the press laughter and it be just go to get more wild pervasive always on network high quality sound and video even device make to be wear instead of carry in the pocket will transform how we live on a scale that few really appreciate it be no exaggeration to say that the mobile phone may be among the world most important technology and in this rapidly evolve context it be possible to imagine a world in which the mobile phone become something far more than a medium for social interaction I have long admire the Witness project and Peter Gabriel tell we more detail about it on Wednesday in he profoundly move presentation and I be just incredibly happy to see the news that Witness be go to be open up a web portal to enable user of digital camera and camera phone to send in they record over the internet rather than just hand carry the videotape not only do this add a new and potentially safe avenue for document abuse it open up the program to the grow global digital generation now imagine a similar model for network environmentalist imagine a web portal collect recording and evidence of what be happen to the planet put news and datum at the fingertip of person of all kind from activist and researcher to businessperson and political figure it would highlight the change that be underway but would more importantly give voice to the person who be willing to work to see a new world a good world come about it would give everyday citizen a chance to play a role in the protection of the planet it would be in essence a Earth Witness project now just to be clear in this talk I be use the name Earth Witness as part of the scenario simply as a shorthand for what this imaginary project could aspire to not to piggyback on the wonderful work of the Witness organization it could just as easily be call environmental transparency Project Smart Mobs for Natural Security but Earth Witness be a lot easy to say now many of the person who participate in Earth Witness would focus on ecological problem human cause or otherwise especially environmental crime and significant source of greenhouse gas and emission that be understandable and important we need good documentation of what be happen to the planet if we be ever go to have a chance of repair the damage but the Earth Witness project would not need to be limit to problem in the good worldchanging tradition it might also serve as a showcase for good idea successful project and effort to make a difference that deserve much more visibility Earth Witness would show we two world the world we be leave behind and the world we be build for generation to come and what make this scenario particularly appeal to I be we could do it today the key component be already widely available Camera phone of course would be fundamental to the project and for a lot of we they be as close as we have yet to always on widely available information tool we may not remember to bring we digital camera with we wherever we go but very few of we forget we phone you could even imagine a version of this scenario in which person actually build they own phone over the course of last year open source hardware hacker have come up with multiple model for usable Linux base mobile phone and the Earth phone could spin off from this kind of project at the other end of the network there have be a server for person to send photo and message to accessible over the web combine a photo sharing service social networking platform and a collaborative filtering system now you web 2 0 folk in the audience know what I be talk about but for that of you for whom that last sentence be in a crazy moon language I mean simply this the online part of the Earth Witness project would be create by the user work together and work openly that be enough right there to start to build a compelling chronicle of what be now happen to we planet but we could do more a Earth Witness site could also serve as a collection spot for all sort of datum about condition around the planet pick up by environmental sensor that attach to you cell phone now you do not see this device as add ons for phone yet but student and engineer around the world have attach atmospheric sensor to bicycle and handheld computer and cheap robot and the back of pigeon that be a project that be actually underway right now at U C Irvine use bird mount sensor as a way of measure smog form pollution it be hardly a stretch to imagine put the same thing on a phone carry by a person now the idea of connect a sensor to you phone be not new phone maker around the world offer phone that sniff for bad breath or tell you to worry about too much sun exposure Swedish firm Uppsala Biomedical more seriously make a mobile phone add on that can process blood test in the field uploading the datum display the result even the Lawrence Livermore National Labs have get into the act design a prototype phone that have radiation sensor to find dirty bomb now there be a enormous variety of tiny inexpensive sensor on the market and you can easily imagine someone put together a phone that could measure temperature co2 or methane level the presence of some biotoxin potentially in a few year maybe even h5n1 avian flu virus you could see that some kind of system like this would actually be a really good fit with Larry Brilliant InSTEDD project now all of this datum could be tag with geographic information and mash up with online map for easy viewing and analysis and that be worth note in particular the impact of open access online map over the last year or two have be simply phenomenal developer around the world have come up with a amazing variety of way to layer useful datum on top of the map from bus route and crime statistics to the global progress of avian flu Earth Witness would take this further link what you see with what thousand or million of other person see around the world it be kind of exciting to think about what might be accomplish if something like this ever exist we would have a far better far good knowledge of what be happen on we planet environmentally than could be gather with satellite and a handful of government sensor net alone it would be a collaborative bottom up approach to environmental awareness and protection able to respond to emerge concern in a smart mob kind of way and if you need great sensor density just have more person show up and most important you can not ignore how important mobile phone be to global youth this be a system that could put the next generation at the front line of gather environmental datum and as we work to figure out way to mitigate the bad effect of climate disruption every little bit of information matter a system like Earth Witness would be a tool for all of we to participate in the improvement of we knowledge and ultimately the improvement of the planet itself now as I suggest at the outset there be thousand upon thousand of good idea out there so why have I spend the bulk of my time tell you about something that do not exist because this be what tomorrow could look like bottom up technology enable global collaboration to handle the big crisis we civilization have ever face we can save the planet but we can not do it alone we need each other nobody be go to fix the world for we but work together make use of technological innovation and human community alike we might just be able to fix it ourselves we have at we fingertip a cornucopia of compelling model powerful tool and innovative idea that can make a meaningful difference in we planet future we do not need to wait for a magic bullet to save we all we already have a arsenal of solution just wait to be use there be a staggering array of wonder out there across diverse discipline all tell we the same thing success can be ours if we be willing to try and as we say at Worldchanging another world be not just possible another world be here we just need to open we eye thank you very much
