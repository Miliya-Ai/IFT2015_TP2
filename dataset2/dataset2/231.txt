Cultural evolution be a dangerous child for any species to let loose on its planet by the time you realize what be happen the child be a toddler up and cause havoc and it be too late to put it back we human be Earth Pandoran species we be the one who let the second replicator out of its box and we can not push it back in we be see the consequence all around we now that I suggest be the view that come out of take memetic seriously and it give we a new way of think about not only what be go on on we planet but what might be go on elsewhere in the cosmos so first of all I would like to say something about memetic and the theory of meme and secondly how this might answer question about who be out there if indeed anyone be so memetic memetic be found on the principle of universal darwinism Darwin have this amazing idea indeed some person say it be the good idea anybody ever have be not that a wonderful thought that there could be such a thing as a good idea anybody ever have do you think there could audience no laughter Susan Blackmore someone say no very loudly from over there well I say yes and if there be I give the prize to Darwin why because the idea be so simple and yet it explain all design in the universe I would say not just biological design but all of the design that we think of as human design it be all just the same thing happen what do Darwin say I know you know the idea natural selection but let I just paraphrase the origin of species 1859 in a few sentence what Darwin say be something like this if you have creature that vary and that can not be doubt I have be to the Galapagos and I have measure the size of the beak and the size of the turtle shell and so on and so on and 100 page late laughter and if there be a struggle for life such that nearly all of this creature die and this can not be doubt I have read Malthus and I have calculate how long it would take for elephant to cover the whole world if they breed unrestricted and so on and so on and another 100 page late and if the very few that survive pass onto they offspring whatever it be that help they survive then that offspring must be good adapt to the circumstance in which all this happen than they parent be you see the idea if if if then he have no concept of the idea of a algorithm but that be what he describe in that book and this be what we now know as the evolutionary algorithm the principle be you just need that three thing variation selection and heredity and as Dan Dennett put it if you have that then you must get evolution or design out of chaos without the aid of mind there be one word I love on that slide what do you think my favorite word be audience Chaos SB Chaos No what mind no audience without SB No not without laughter you try they all in order mmm audience must SB must at must must must this be what make it so amazing you do not need a designer or a plan or foresight or anything else if there be something that be copy with variation and it be select then you must get design appear out of nowhere you can not stop it must be my favorite word there now what be this to do with meme well the principle here apply to anything that be copy with variation and selection we be so use to think in term of biology we think about gene this way Darwin do not of course he do not know about gene he talk mostly about animal and plant but also about language evolve and become extinct but the principle of universal darwinism be that any information that be varied and select will produce design and this be what Richard Dawkins be on about in he 1976 bestseller the selfish gene the information that be copy he call the replicator it selfishly copy not mean it kind of sit around inside cell go I want to get copy but that it will get copy if it can regardless of the consequence it do not care about the consequence because it can not because it be just information be copy and he want to get away from everybody think all the time about gene and so he say be there another replicator out there on the planet ah yes there be look around you here will do in this room all around we still clumsily drift about in its primeval soup of culture be another replicator information that we copy from person to person by imitation by language by talk by tell story by wear clothes by do thing this be information copy with variation and selection this be design process go on he want a name for the new replicator so he take the Greek word mimeme which mean that which be imitate remember that that be the core definition that which be imitate and abbreviate it to meme just because it sound good and make a good meme a effective spread meme so that be how the idea come about it be important to stick with that definition the whole science of memetic be much malign much misunderstand much fear but a lot of this problem can be avoid by remember the definition a meme be not equivalent to a idea it be not a idea it be not equivalent to anything else really Stick with the definition it be that which be imitate or information which be copy from person to person so let see some meme well you sir you have get that glass hang around you neck in that particularly fetch way I wonder whether you invent that idea for yourself or copy it from someone else if you copy it from someone else it be a meme and what about oh I can not see any interesting meme here all right everyone who be get some interesting meme for I oh well you earring I do not suppose you invent the idea of earring you probably go out and buy they there be plenty more in the shop that be something that be pass on from person to person all the story that we be tell well of course TED be a great meme f mass of meme the way to think about meme though be to think why do they spread they be selfish information they will get copy if they can but some of they will be copy because they be good or true or useful or beautiful some of they will be copy even though they be not some it be quite hard to tell why there be one particular curious meme which I rather enjoy and I be glad to say as I expect I find it when I come here and I be sure all of you find it too you go to you nice posh international hotel somewhere and you come in and you put down you clothes and you go to the bathroom and what do you see Audience Bathroom soap sb Pardon Audience Soap SB Soap yeah what else do you see audience inaudible sb mmm mmm Audience Sink toilet SB Sink toilet yes this be all meme they be all meme but they be sort of useful one and then there be this one laughter what be this one do laughter this have spread all over the world it be not surprising that you all find it when you arrive in you bathroom here but I take this photograph in a toilet at the back of a tent in the eco camp in the jungle in Assam laughter who fold that thing up there and why laughter some person get carry away laughter other person be just lazy and make mistake some hotel exploit the opportunity to put even more meme with a little sticker laughter what be this all about I suppose it be there to tell you that somebody clean the place and it be all lovely and you know actually all it tell you be that another person have potentially spread germ from place to place laughter so think of it this way imagine a world full of brain and far more meme than can possibly find home the meme be all try to get copy try in invert comma I e that be the shorthand for if they can get copy they will they be use you and I as they propagate copy machinery and we be the meme machine now why be this important why be this useful or what do it tell we it give we a completely new view of human origin and what it mean to be human all conventional theory of cultural evolution of the origin of human and what make we so different from other species all other theory explain the big brain and language and tool use and all this thing that make we unique be base upon gene Language must have be useful for the gene Tool use must have enhance we survival mating and so on it always come back as Richard Dawkins complain all that long time ago it always come back to gene the point of memetic be to say oh no it do not there be two replicator now on this planet from the moment that we ancestor perhaps two and a half million year ago or so begin imitate there be a new copying process copying with variation and selection a new replicator be let loose and it could never be right from the start it could never be that human being who let loose this new creature could just copy the useful beautiful true thing and not copy the other thing while they brain be have a advantage from be able to copy lighting fire keep fire go new technique of hunt this kind of thing inevitably they be also copy put feather in they hair or wear strange clothes or paint they face or whatever so you get a arm race between the gene which be try to get the human to have small economical brain and not waste they time copy all this stuff and the meme themselves like the sound that person make and copy in other word what turn out to be language compete to get the brain to get big and big so the big brain on this theory be drive by the meme this be why in the Meme Machine I call it memetic drive as the meme evolve as they inevitably must they drive a big brain that be good at copy the meme that be do the drive this be why we have end up with such peculiar brain that we like religion and music and art Language be a parasite that we have adapt to not something that be there originally for we gene on this view and like most parasite it can begin dangerous but then it coevolve and adapt and we end up with a symbiotic relationship with this new parasite and so from we perspective we do not realize that that be how it begin so this be a view of what human be all other species on this planet be gene machine only they do not imitate at all well hardly at all we alone be gene machine and meme machine as well the meme take a gene machine and turn it into a meme machine but that be not all we have a new kind of meme now I have be wonder for a long time since I have be think about meme a lot be there a difference between the meme that we copy the word we speak to each other the gesture we copy the human thing and all this technological thing around we I have always until now call they all meme but I do honestly think now we need a new word for technological meme let call they techno meme or teme because the process be get different we begin perhaps 5 000 year ago with write we put the storage of meme out there on a clay tablet but in order to get true teme and true teme machine you need to get the variation the selection and the copying all do outside of human and we be get there we be at this extraordinary point where we be nearly there that there be machine like that and indeed in the short time I have already be at TED I see we be even close than I think we be before so actually now the teme be force we brain to become more like teme machine we child be grow up very quickly learn to read learning to use machinery we be go to have all kind of implant drug that force we to stay awake all the time we will think we be choose this thing but the teme be make we do it so we be at this cusp now of have a third replicator on we planet now what about what else be go on out there in the universe be there anyone else out there person have be ask this question for a long time we have be ask it here at TED already in 1961 Frank Drake make he famous equation but I think he concentrate on the wrong thing it be be very productive that equation he want to estimate n the number of communicative civilization out there in we galaxy and he include in there the rate of star formation the rate of planet but crucially intelligence I think that be the wrong way to think about it intelligence appear all over the place in all kind of guise human intelligence be only one kind of a thing but what be really important be the replicator you have and the level of replicator one feeding on the one before so I would suggest that we do not think intelligence we think replicator and on that basis I have suggest a different kind of equation a very simple equation n the same thing the number of communicative civilization out there that we might expect in we galaxy just start with the number of planet there be in we galaxy the fraction of that which get a first replicator the fraction of that that get the second replicator the fraction of that that get the third replicator because it be only the third replicator that be go to reach out send information send probe get out there and communicate with anywhere else ok so if we take that equation why have not we hear from anybody out there because every step be dangerous get a new replicator be dangerous you can pull through we have pull through but it be dangerous take the first step as soon as life appear on this earth we may take the gaian view I love Peter Ward talk yesterday it be not gaian all the time actually life form produce thing that kill themselves well we do pull through on this planet but then a long time late billion of year later we get the second replicator the meme that be dangerous all right think of the big brain how many mother do we have here you know all about big brain they be dangerous to give birth to be agonizing to give birth to laughter my cat give birth to four kitten purr all the time Ah mm slightly different laughter but not only be it painful it kill lot of baby it kill lot of mother and it be very expensive to produce the gene be force into produce all this myelin all the fat to myelinate the brain do you know sit here you brain be use about 20 percent of you body energy output for two percent of you body weight it be a really expensive organ to run why because it be produce the meme now it could have kill we off it could have kill we off and maybe it nearly do but you see we do not know but maybe it nearly do have it be try before what about all that other species Louise Leakey talk yesterday about how we be the only one in this branch leave what happen to the other could it be that this experiment in imitation this experiment in a second replicator be dangerous enough to kill person off well we do pull through and we adapt but now we be hit as I have just describe we be hit the third replicator point and this be even more dangerous well it be dangerous again why because the teme be selfish replicator and they do not care about we or we planet or anything else they be just information why would they they be use we to suck up the planet resource to produce more computer and more of all this amazing thing we be hear about here at TED do not think oh we create the internet for we own benefit that be how it seem to we think teme spread because they must we be the old machine now be we go to pull through what be go to happen what do it mean to pull through well there be kind of two way of pull through one that be obviously happen all around we now be that the teme turn we into teme machine with this implant with the drug with we merge with the technology and why would they do that because we be self replicate we have baby we make new one and so it be convenient to piggyback on we because we be not yet at the stage on this planet where the other option be viable although it be close I hear this morning it be close than I think it be where the teme machine themselves will replicate themselves that way it would not matter if the planet climate be utterly destabilized and it be no long possible for human to live here because that teme machine they would not need they be not squishy wet oxygen breathing warmth require creature they could carry on without we so that be the two possibility the second I do not think we be that close it be come but we be not there yet the first it be come too but the damage that be already be do to the planet be show we how dangerous the third point be that third danger point get a third replicator and will we get through this third danger point like we get through the second and like we get through the first maybe we will maybe we will not I have no idea applause Chris Anderson that be a incredible talk sb thank you I scare myself ca laughter
