there be nothing big or old than the universe the question I would like to talk about be one where do we come from how do the universe come into be be we alone in the universe be there alien life out there what be the future of the human race up until the 1920 everyone think the universe be essentially static and unchanging in time then it be discover that the universe be expand distant galaxy be move away from we this mean they must have be close together in the past if we extrapolate back we find we must have all be on top of each other about 15 billion year ago this be the Big Bang the beginning of the universe but be there anything before the Big Bang if not what create the universe why do the universe emerge from the Big Bang the way it do we use to think that the theory of the universe could be divide into two part first there be the law like Maxwell equation and general relativity that determine the evolution of the universe give its state over all of space at one time and second there be no question of the initial state of the universe we have make good progress on the first part and now have the knowledge of the law of evolution in all but the most extreme condition but until recently we have have little idea about the initial condition for the universe however this division into law of evolution and initial condition depend on time and space be separate and distinct under extreme condition general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space this remove the distinction between time and space and mean the law of evolution can also determine the initial state the universe can spontaneously create itself out of nothing moreover we can calculate a probability that the universe be create in different state this prediction be in excellent agreement with observation by the WMAP satellite of the cosmic microwave background which be a imprint of the very early universe we think we have solve the mystery of creation maybe we should patent the universe and charge everyone royalty for they existence I now turn to the second big question be we alone or be there other life in the universe we believe that life arise spontaneously on the Earth so it must be possible for life to appear on other suitable planet of which there seem to be a large number in the galaxy but we do not know how life first appear we have two piece of observational evidence on the probability of life appear the first be that we have fossil of alga from 3 5 billion year ago the Earth be form 4 6 billion year ago and be probably too hot for about the first half billion year so life appear on Earth within half a billion year of it be possible which be short compare to the 10 billion year lifetime of a planet of Earth type this suggest that the probability of life appear be reasonably high if it be very low one would have expect it to take most of the ten billion year available on the other hand we do not seem to have be visit by alien I be discount the report of ufo why would they appear only to crank and weirdo if there be a government conspiracy to suppress the report and keep for itself the scientific knowledge the alien bring it seem to have be a singularly ineffective policy so far furthermore despite a extensive search by the seti project we have not hear any alien television quiz show this probably indicate that there be no alien civilization at we stage of development within a radius of a few hundred light year issue a insurance policy against abduction by alien seem a pretty safe bet this bring I to the last of the big question the future of the human race if we be the only intelligent being in the galaxy we should make sure we survive and continue but we be enter a increasingly dangerous period of we history we population and we use of the finite resource of planet earth be grow exponentially along with we technical ability to change the environment for good or ill but we genetic code still carry the selfish and aggressive instinct that be of survival advantage in the past it will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred year let alone the next thousand or million we only chance of long term survival be not to remain inward look on planet earth but to spread out into space the answer to this big question show that we have make remarkable progress in the last hundred year but if we want to continue beyond the next hundred year we future be in space that be why I be in favor of manned or should I say personn space flight all of my life I have seek to understand the universe and find answer to this question I have be very lucky that my disability have not be a serious handicap indeed it have probably give I more time than most person to pursue the quest for knowledge the ultimate goal be a complete theory of the universe and we be make good progress thank you for listen Chris Anderson Professor if you have to guess either way do you now believe that it be more likely than not that we be alone in the Milky Way as a civilization of we level of intelligence or high this answer take seven minute and really give I a insight into the incredible act of generosity this whole talk be for TED Stephen Hawking I think it quite likely that we be the only civilization within several hundred light year otherwise we would have hear radio wave the alternative be that civilization do not last very long but destroy themselves CA Professor Hawking thank you for that answer we will take it as a salutary warning I think for the rest of we conference this week professor we really thank you for the extraordinary effort you make to share you question with we today thank you very much indeed applause
