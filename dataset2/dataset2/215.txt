the value of nothing out of nothing come something that be a essay I write when I be 11 year old and I get a b laughter what I be go to talk about nothing out of something and how we create and I be go to try and do that within the 18 minute time span that we be tell to stay within and to follow the TED commandment that be actually something that create a near death experience but near death be good for creativity laughter ok so I also want to explain because Dave Eggers say he be go to heckle I if I say anything that be a lie or not true to universal creativity and I have do it this way for half the audience who be scientific when I say we I do not mean you necessarily I mean I and my right brain my left brain and the one that be in between that be the censor and tell I what I be say be wrong and I be go do that also by look at what I think be part of my creative process which include a number of thing that happen actually the nothing start even early than the moment in which I be create something new and that include nature and nurture and what I refer to as nightmare now in the nature area we look at whether or not we be innately equip with something perhaps in we brain some abnormal chromosome that cause this muse like effect and some person would say that we be bear with it in some other means and other like my mother would say that I get my material from past life some person would also say that creativity may be a function of some other neurological quirk van Gogh syndrome that you have a little bit of you know psychosis or depression I do have to say somebody I read recently that van Gogh be not really necessarily psychotic that he might have have temporal lobe seizure and that might have cause he spurt of creativity and I do not I suppose it do something in some part of you brain and I will mention that I actually develop temporal lobe seizure a number of year ago but it be during the time I be write my last book and some person say that book be quite different I think that part of it also begin with a sense of identity crisis you know who be I why be I this particular person why be I not black like everybody else and sometimes you be equip with skill but they may not be the kind of skill that enable creativity I use to draw I think I would be a artist and I have a miniature poodle and it be not bad but it be not really creative because all I could really do be represent in a very one on one way and I have a sense that I probably copy this from a book and then I also be not really shine in a certain area that I want to be and you know you look at that score and it be not bad but it be not certainly predictive that I would one day make my live out of the artful arrangement of word also one of the principle of creativity be to have a little childhood trauma and I have the usual kind that I think a lot of person have and that be that you know I have expectation place on I that figure right there by the way figure right there be a toy give to I when I be but nine year old and it be to help I become a doctor from a very early age I have some one that be long last from the age of five to 15 this be suppose to be my side occupation and it lead to a sense of failure but actually there be something quite real in my life that happen when I be about 14 and it be discover that my brother in 1967 and then my father six month later have brain tumor and my mother believe that something have go wrong and she be go to find out what it be and she be go to fix it my father be a Baptist minister and he believe in miracle and that God will would take care of that but of course they end up die six month apart and after that my mother believe that it be fate or curse she go look through all the reason in the universe why this would have happen everything except randomness she do not believe in randomness there be a reason for everything and one of the reason she think be that she mother who have die when she be very young be angry at she and so I have this notion of death all around I because my mother also believe that I would be next and she would be next and when you be face with the prospect of death very soon you begin to think very much about everything you become very creative in a survival sense and this then lead to my big question and they be the same one that I have today and they be why do thing happen and how do thing happen and the one my mother ask how do I make thing happen it be a wonderful way to look at this question when you write a story because after all in that framework between page one and 300 you have to answer this question of why thing happen how thing happen in what order they happen what be the influence how do I as the narrator as the writer also influence that and it be also one that I think many of we scientist have be ask it be a kind of cosmology and I have to develop a cosmology of my own universe as the creator of that universe and you see there be a lot of back and forth in try to make that happen try to figure it out year and year oftentimes so when I look at creativity I also think that it be this sense or this inability to repress my look at association in practically anything in life and I get a lot of they during what be be go on throughout this conference almost everything that be be go on and so I be go to use as the metaphor this association quantum mechanic which I really do not understand but I be still go to use it as the process for explain how it be the metaphor so in quantum mechanic of course you have dark energy and dark matter and it be the same thing in look at this question of how thing happen there be a lot of unknown and you often do not know what it be except by its absence but when you make that association you want they to come together in a kind of synergy in the story and what you be find be what matter the meaning and that be what I look for in my work a personal meaning there be also the uncertainty principle which be part of quantum mechanic as I understand it laughter and this happen constantly in the writing and there be the terrible and dreaded observer effect in which you be look for something and you know thing be happen simultaneously and you be look at it in a different way and you be try to really look for the about ness or what be this story about and if you try too hard then you will only write the about you will not discover anything and what you be suppose to find what you hope to find in some serendipitous way be no longer there now I do not want to ignore the other side of what happen in we universe like many of we scientist have and so I be go to just throw in string theory here and just say that creative person be multidimensional and there be 11 level I think of anxiety laughter and they all operate at the same time there be also a big question of ambiguity and I would link that to something call the cosmological constant and you do not know what be operate but something be operate there and ambiguity to I be very uncomfortable in my life and I have it Moral ambiguity it be constantly there and just as a example this be one that recently come to I it be something I read in a editorial by a woman who be talk about the war in Iraq and she say save a man from drown you be responsible to he for life a very famous Chinese say she say and that mean because we go into Iraq we should stay there until thing be solve you know maybe even 100 year so there be another one that I come across and it be save fish from drown and it be what Buddhist fisherman say because they be not suppose to kill anything and they also have to make a living and person need to be feed so they way of rationalize that be they be save the fish from drown and unfortunately in the process the fish die now what be encapsulate in both this drown metaphor actually one of they be my mother interpretation and it be a famous Chinese saying because she say it to I save a man from drown you be responsible to he for life and it be a warning do not get involve in other person business or you be go to get stuck ok I think if somebody really be drown she would save they but both of this say save a fish from drown or save a man from drown to I they have to do with intention and all of we in life when we see a situation we have a response and then we have intention there be a ambiguity of what that should be that we should do and then we do something and the result of that may not match what we intention have be maybe thing go wrong and so after that what be we responsibility what be we suppose to do do we stay in for life or do we do something else and justify and say well my intention be good and therefore I can not be hold responsible for all of it that be the ambiguity in my life that really disturb I and lead I to write a book call save fish from drown I see example of that once I identify this question it be all over the place I get this hint everywhere and then in a way I know that they have always be there and then write that be what happen I get this hint this clue and I realize that they have be obvious and yet they have not be and what I need in effect be a focus and when I have the question it be a focus and all this thing that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through that question and what happen be that particular thing become relevant and it seem like it be happen all the time you think there be a sort of coincidence go on a serendipity in which you be get all this help from the universe and it may also be explain that now you have a focus and you be notice it more often but you apply this you begin to look at thing have to do with you tension you brother who be fall in trouble do you take care of he why or why not it may be something that be perhaps more serious as I say human right in Burma I be think that I should not go because somebody say if I do it would show that I approve of the military regime there and then after a while I have to ask myself why do we take on knowledge why do we take on assumption that other person have give we and it be the same thing that I feel when I be grow up and be hear this rule of moral conduct from my father who be a Baptist minister so I decide that I would go to Burma for my own intention and still do not know that if I go there what the result of that would be if I write a book and I just would have to face that later when the time come we be all concern with thing that we see in the world that we be aware of we come to this point and say what do I as a individual do not all of we can go to Africa or work at hospital so what do we do if we have this moral response this feeling also I think one of the big thing we be all look at and we talk about today be genocide this lead to this question when I look at all this thing that be morally ambiguous and uncomfortable and I consider what my intention should be I realize it go back to this identity question that I have when I be a child and why be I here and what be the meaning of my life and what be my place in the universe it seem so obvious and yet it be not we all hate moral ambiguity in some sense and yet it be also absolutely necessary in write a story it be the place where I begin sometimes I get help from the universe it seem my mother would say it be the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book because it seem I know thing I be not suppose to know instead of write that the grandmother die accidentally from a overdose of opium while have too much of a good time I actually put down in the story that the woman kill herself and that actually be the way it happen and my mother decide that that information must have come from my grandmother there be also thing quite uncanny which bring I information that will help I in the writing of the book in this case I be write a story that include some kind of detail period of history a certain location and I need to find something historically that would match that and I take down this book and I first page that I flip it to be exactly the setting and the time period and the kind of character I need be the Taiping rebellion happen in the area near Guilin outside of that and a character who think he be the son of God you wonder be this thing random chance well what be random what be chance what be luck what be thing that you get from the universe that you can not really explain and that go into the story too this be the thing I constantly think about from day to day especially when good thing happen and in particular when bad thing happen but I do think there be a kind of serendipity and I do want to know what that element be so I can thank they and also try to find they in my life because again I think that when I be aware of they more of they happen another chance encounter be when I go to a place I just be with some friend and we drive randomly to a different place and we end up in this non tourist location a beautiful village pristine and we walk three valley beyond and the third valley there be something quite mysterious and ominous a discomfort I feel and then I know that have to be the setting of my book and in write one of the scene it happen in that third valley for some reason I write about cairns stack of rock that a man be build and I do not know exactly why I have it but it be so vivid I get stuck and a friend when she ask if I would go for a walk with she dog that I say sure and about 45 minute later walk along the beach I come across this and it be a man a Chinese man and he be stack this thing not with glue not with anything and I ask he how be it possible to do this and he say well I guess with everything in life there be a place of balance and this be exactly the meaning of my story at that point I have so many example I have so many instance like this when I be write a story and I can not explain it be it because I have the filter that I have such a strong coincidence in write about this thing or be it a kind of serendipity that we can not explain like the cosmological constant a big thing that I also think about be accident and as I say my mother do not believe in randomness what be the nature of accident and how be we go to assign what the responsibility and the cause be outside of a court of law I be able to see that in a firsthand way when I go to beautiful Dong village in Guizhou the poor province of China and I see this beautiful place I know I want to come back and I have a chance to do that when National Geographic ask I if I want to write anything about China and I say yes about this village of sing person sing minority and they agree and between the time I see this place and the next time I go there be a terrible accident a man a old man fall asleep and he quilt drop in a pan of fire that keep he warm 60 home be destroy and 40 be damage responsibility be assign to the family the man son be banish to live three kilometer away in a cowshed and of course as Westerner we say well it be a accident that be not fair it be the son not the father when I go on a story I have to let go of that kind of belief it take a while but I have to let go of they and just go there and be there and so I be there on three occasion different season and I begin to sense something different about the history and what have happen before and the nature of life in a very poor village and what you find as you joy and you ritual you tradition you link with other family and I see how this have a kind of justice in its responsibility I be able to find out also about the ceremony that they be use a ceremony they have not use in about 29 year and it be to send some man a Feng Shui master send man down to the underworld on ghost horse now you as Westerner and I as Westerner would say well that be superstition but after be there for a while and see the amazing thing that happen you begin to wonder whose belief be that that be in operation in the world determine how thing happen so I remain with they and the more I write that story the more I get into that belief and I think that be important for I to take on the belief because that be where the story be real and that be where I be go to find the answer to how I feel about certain question that I have in life year go by of course and the write it do not happen instantly as I be try to convey it to you here at TED the book come and it go when it arrive it be no long my book it be in the hand of reader and they interpret it differently but I go back to this question of how do I create something out of nothing and how do I create my own life and I think it be by question and say to myself that there be no absolute truth I believe in specifics the specifics of story and the past the specifics of that past and what be happen in the story at that point I also believe that in think about thing my thinking about luck and fate and coincidence and accident God will and the synchrony of mysterious force I will come to some notion of what that be how we create I have to think of my role where I be in the universe and do somebody intend for I to be that way or be it just something I come up with and I also can find that by imagine fully and become what be imagine and yet be in that real world the fictional world and that be how I find particle of truth not the absolute truth or the whole truth and they have to be in all possibility include that I never consider before so there be never complete answer or rather if there be a answer it be to remind myself that there be uncertainty in everything and that be good because then I will discover something new and if there be a partial answer a more complete answer from I it be to simply imagine and to imagine be to put myself in that story until there be only there be a transparency between I and the story that I be create and that be how I have discover that if I feel what be in the story in one story then I come the close I think to know what compassion be to feel that compassion because for everything in that question of how thing happen it have to do with the feeling I have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that we have come to the end of the talk and I will reveal what be in the bag and it be the muse and it be the thing that transform in we life that be wonderful and stay with we there she be thank you very much applause
