how can we investigate this flora of virus that surround we and aid medicine how can we turn we cumulative knowledge of virology into a simple hand hold single diagnostic assay I want to turn everything we know right now about detect virus and the spectrum of virus that be out there into let say a small chip when we start think about this project how we would make a single diagnostic assay to screen for all pathogen simultaneously well there be some problem with this idea First of all virus be pretty complex but they be also evolve very fast this be a picornavirus Picornaviruses this be thing that include the common cold and polio thing like this you be look at the outside shell of the virus and the yellow color here be that part of the virus that be evolve very very fast and the blue part be not evolve very fast when person think about make pan viral detection reagent usually it be the fast evolve problem that be a issue because how can we detect thing if they be always change but evolution be a balance where you have fast change you also have ultra conservation thing that almost never change and so we look into this a little more carefully and I be go to show you datum now this be just some stuff you can do on the computer from the desktop I take a bunch of this small picornavirus like the common cold like polio and so on and I just break they down into small segment and so take this first example which be call coxsackievirus and just break it into small window and I be color this small window blue if another virus share a identical sequence in its genome to that virus this sequence right up here which do not even code for protein by the way be almost absolutely identical across all of this so I could use this sequence as a marker to detect a wide spectrum of virus without have to make something individual now over here there be great diversity that be where thing be evolve fast down here you can see slow evolution less diversity now by the time we get out here to let say acute bee paralysis virus probably a bad one to have if you be a bee this virus share almost no similarity to coxsackievirus but I can guarantee you that the sequence that be most conserve among this virus on the right hand of the screen be in identical region right up here and so we can encapsulate this region of ultra conservation through evolution how this virus evolve by just choose dna element or rna element in this region to represent on we chip as detection reagent ok so that be what we do but how be we go to do that well for a long time since I be in graduate school I have be mess around make dna chip that be print dna on glass and that be what you see here this little salt spot be just dna tack onto glass and so I can put thousand of this on we glass chip and use they as a detection reagent we take we chip over to Hewlett Packard and use they atomic force microscope on one of this spot and this be what you see you can actually see the strand of dna lie flat on the glass here so what we be do be just print dna on glass little flat thing and this be go to be marker for pathogen ok I make little robot in lab to make this chip and I be really big on disseminate technology if you have get enough money to buy just a Camry you can build one of this too and so we put a deep how to guide on the web totally free with basically order off the shelf part you can build a dna array machine in you garage here be the section on the all important emergency stop switch laughter every important machine be get to have a big red button but really it be pretty robust you can actually be make dna chip in you garage and decode some genetic program pretty rapidly it be a lot of fun laughter and so what we do and this be a really cool project we just start by make a respiratory virus chip I talk about that you know that situation where you go into the clinic and you do not get diagnose well we just put basically all the human respiratory virus on one chip and we throw in herpes virus for good measure I mean why not the first thing you do as a scientist be you make sure stuff work and so what we do be we take tissue culture cell and infect they with various virus and we take the stuff and fluorescently label the nucleic acid the genetic material that come out of this tissue culture cell mostly viral stuff and stick it on the array to see where it stick now if the dna sequence match they will stick together and so we can look at spot and if spot light up we know there be a certain virus in there that be what one of this chip really look like and this red spot be in fact signal come from the virus and each spot represent a different family of virus or species of virus and so that be a hard way to look at thing so I be just go to encode thing as a little barcode group by family so you can see the result in a very intuitive way what we do be we take tissue culture cell and infect they with adenovirus and you can see this little yellow barcode next to adenovirus and likewise we infect they with parainfluenza 3 that be a paramyxovirus and you see a little barcode here and then we do respiratory syncytial virus that be the scourge of daycare center everywhere it be like boogeremia basically laughter you can see that this barcode be the same family but it be distinct from parainfluenza 3 which give you a very bad cold and so we be get unique signature a fingerprint for each virus Polio and rhino they be in the same family very close to each other Rhino the common cold and you all know what polio be and you can see that this signature be distinct and Kaposi sarcoma associate herpes virus give a nice signature down here and so it be not any one stripe or something that tell I I have a virus of a particular type here it be the barcode that in bulk represent the whole thing all right I can see a rhinovirus and here be the blow up of the rhinovirus little barcode but what about different rhinovirus how do I know which rhinovirus I have there be 102 know variant of the common cold and there be only 102 because person get bored collect they there be just new one every year and so here be four different rhinovirus and you can see even with you eye without any fancy computer pattern match recognition software algorithm that you can distinguish each one of this barcode from each other now this be kind of a cheap shot because I know what the genetic sequence of all this rhinovirus be and I in fact design the chip expressly to be able to tell they apart but what about rhinovirus that have never see a genetic sequencer we do not know what the sequence be just pull they out of the field so here be four rhinovirus we never know anything about no one ever sequence they and you can also see that you get unique and distinguishable pattern you can imagine build up some library whether real or virtual of fingerprint of essentially every virus but that be again shoot fish in a barrel you know right you have tissue culture cell there be a ton of virus what about real person you can not control real person as you probably know you have no idea what someone be go to cough into a cup and it be probably really complex right it could have lot of bacterium it could have more than one virus and it certainly have host genetic material so how do we deal with this and how do we do the positive control here well it be pretty simple that be I get a nasal lavage and the idea be let experimentally inoculate person with virus this be all IRB approve by the way they get pay and basically we experimentally inoculate person with the common cold virus or even good let just take person right out of the emergency room undefined community acquire respiratory tract infection you have no idea what walk in through the door so let start off with the positive control first where we know the person be healthy they get a shot of virus up the nose let see what happen Day zero nothing happen they be healthy they be clean it be amazing actually we think the nasal tract might be full of virus even when you be walk around healthy it be pretty clean if you be healthy you be pretty healthy day two we get a very robust rhinovirus pattern and it be very similar to what we get in the lab do we tissue culture experiment so that be great but again cheap shot right we put a ton of virus up this guy nose so laughter I mean we want it to work he really have a cold so how about the person who walk in off the street here be two individual represent by they anonymous id code they both have rhinovirus we have never see this pattern in lab we sequence part of they virus they be new rhinovirus no one actually even see remember we evolutionary conserve sequence we be use on this array allow we to detect even novel or uncharacterized virus because we pick what be conserve throughout evolution here be another guy you can play the diagnosis game yourself here this different block represent the different virus in this paramyxovirus family so you can kind of go down the block and see where the signal be well do not have canine distemper that be probably good laughter but by the time you get to block nine you see that respiratory syncytial virus maybe they have kid and then you can see also the family member that be relate RSVB be show up here so that be great here be another individual sample on two separate day repeat visit to the clinic this individual have parainfluenza 1 and you can see that there be a little stripe over here for Sendai virus that be mouse parainfluenza the genetic relationship be very close there that be a lot of fun so we build out the chip we make a chip that have every know virus ever discover on it why not every plant virus every insect virus every marine virus everything that we could get out of GenBank that be the national repository of sequence now we be use this chip and what be we use it for well first of all when you have a big chip like this you need a little bit more informatics so we design the system to do automatic diagnosis and the idea be that we simply have virtual pattern because we be never go to get sample of every virus it would be virtually impossible but we can get virtual pattern and compare they to we observe result which be a very complex mixture and come up with some sort of score of how likely it be this be a rhinovirus or something and this be what this look like if for example you use a cell culture that be chronically infect with papilloma you get a little computer readout here and we algorithm say it be probably papilloma type 18 and that be in fact what this particular cell culture be chronically infect with so let do something a little bit hard we put the beeper in the clinic when somebody show up and the hospital do not know what to do because they can not diagnose it they call we that be the idea and we be set this up in the Bay Area and so this case report happen three week ago we have a 28 year old healthy woman no travel history unclear do not smoke do not drink 10 day history of fever night sweat bloody sputum she be cough up blood muscle pain she go to the clinic and they give she antibiotic and then send she home she come back after ten day of fever right still have the fever and she be hypoxic she do not have much oxygen in she lung they do a ct scan a normal lung be all sort of dark and black here all this white stuff it be not good this sort of tree and bud formation indicate there be inflammation there be likely to be infection ok so the patient be treat then with a third generation cephalosporin antibiotic and doxycycline and on day three it do not help she have progress to acute failure they have to intubate she so they put a tube down she throat and they begin to mechanically ventilate she she could no longer breathe for herself what to do next do not know switch antibiotic so they switch to another antibiotic Tamiflu it be not clear why they think she have the flu but they switch to Tamiflu and on day six they basically throw in the towel you do a open lung biopsy when you have get no other option there be a eight percent mortality rate with just do this procedure and so basically and what do they learn from it you be look at she open lung biopsy and I be no pathologist but you can not tell much from this all you can tell be there be a lot of swell bronchiolitus it be unreveal that be the pathologist report and so what do they test she for they have they own test of course and so they test she for over 70 different assay for every sort of bacterium and fungus and viral assay you can buy off the shelf SARS metapneumovirus hiv rsv all this everything come back negative over 100 000 dollar worth of test I mean they go to the max for this woman and basically on hospital day eight that be when they call we they give we endotracheal aspirate you know a little fluid from the throat from this tube that they get down there and they give we this we put it on the chip what do we see well we see parainfluenza 4 well what the hell parainfluenza 4 no one test for parainfluenza 4 no one care about it in fact it be not even really sequence that much there be just a little bit of it sequence there be almost no epidemiology or study on it no one would even consider it because no one have a clue that it could cause respiratory failure and why be that just lore there be no datum no datum to support whether it cause severe or mild disease clearly we have a case of a healthy person that be go down ok that be one case report I be go to tell you one last thing in the last two minute that be unpublished it be go to come out tomorrow and it be a interesting case of how you might use this chip to find something new and open a new door prostate cancer I do not need to give you many statistics about prostate cancer most of you already know it third lead cause of cancer death in the u s lot of risk factor but there be a genetic predisposition to prostate cancer for maybe about 10 percent of prostate cancer there be folk that be predispose to it and the first gene that be map in association study for this early onset prostate cancer be this gene call rnasel what be that it be a antiviral defense enzyme so we be sit around and think why would man who have the mutation a defect in a antiviral defense system get prostate cancer it do not make sense unless maybe there be a virus so we put tumor and now we have over 100 tumor on we array and we know who be get defect in rnasel and who do not and I be show you the signal from the chip here and I be show you for the block of retroviral oligo and what I be tell you here from the signal be that man who have a mutation in this antiviral defense enzyme and have a tumor often have 40 percent of the time a signature which reveal a new retrovirus ok that be pretty wild what be it so we clone the whole virus First of all I will tell you that a little automated prediction tell we it be very similar to a mouse virus but that do not tell we too much so we actually clone the whole thing and the viral genome I be show you right here it be a classic gamma retrovirus but it be totally new no one ever see it before its close relative be in fact from mouse and so we would call this a xenotropic retrovirus because it be infect a species other than mouse and this be a little phylogenetic tree to see how it be relate to other virus we have do it for many patient now and we can say that they be all independent infection they all have the same virus but they be different enough that there be reason to believe that they have be independently acquire be it really in the tissue and I will end up with this yes we take slice of this biopsy of tumor tissue and use material to actually locate the virus and we find cell here with viral particle in they this guy really do have this virus do this virus cause prostate cancer nothing I be say here imply causality I do not know be it a link to oncogenesis I do not know be it the case that this guy be just more susceptible to virus could be and it might have nothing to do with cancer but now it be a door we have a strong association between the presence of this virus and a genetic mutation that be be link to cancer that be where we be at so it open up more question than it answer I be afraid but that be what you know science be really good at this be all do by folk in the lab I can not take credit for most of this this be a collaboration between myself and Don this be the guy who start the project in my lab and this be the guy who be be do prostate stuff thank you very much applause
