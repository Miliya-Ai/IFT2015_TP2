I would like to talk today about the two big social trend in the coming century and perhaps in the next 10 000 year but I want to start with my work on romantic love because that be my most recent work what I and my colleague do be put 32 person who be madly in love into a functional mri brain scanner 17 who be madly in love and they love be accept and 15 who be madly in love and they have just be dump and so I want to tell you about that first and then go on into where I think love be go laughter what t be to love Shakespeare say I think we ancestor I think human being have be wonder about this question since they sit around they campfire or lay and watch the star a million year ago I start out by try to figure out what romantic love be by look at the last 45 year of the psychological research and as it turn out there be a very specific group of thing that happen when you fall in love the first thing that happen be a person begin to take on what I call special meaning as a truck driver once say to I the world have a new center and that center be Mary Anne George Bernard Shaw say it differently love consist of overestimate the difference between one woman and another and indeed that be what we do laughter and then you just focus on this person you can list what you do not like about they but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do as Chaucer say Love be blind in try to understand romantic love I decide I would read poetry from all over the world and I just want to give you one very short poem from eighth century China because it be a almost perfect example of a man who be focused totally on a particular woman it be a little bit like when you be madly in love with somebody and you walk into a parking lot they car be different from every other car in the parking lot they wine glass at dinner be different from every other wine glass at the dinner party and in this case a man get hook on a bamboo sleep mat and it go like this it be by a guy call Yuan Zhen I can not bear to put away the bamboo sleep mat the night I bring you home I watch you roll it out he become hooked on a sleep mat probably because of elevated activity of dopamine in he brain just like with you and I but anyway not only do this person take on special meaning you focus you attention on they you aggrandize they but you have intense energy as one Polynesian say I feel like jump in the sky you be up all night you be walk till dawn you feel intense elation when thing be go well mood swing into horrible despair when thing be go poorly real dependence on this person as one businessman in New York say to I anything she like I like simple romantic love be very simple you become extremely sexually possessive you know if you be just sleep with somebody casually you do not really care if they be sleep with somebody else but the moment you fall in love you become extremely sexually possessive of they I think there be a darwinian purpose to this the whole point of this be to pull two person together strongly enough to begin to rear baby as a team but the main characteristic of romantic love be craving a intense craving to be with a particular person not just sexually but emotionally it would be nice to go to bed with they but you want they to call you on the telephone to invite you out etc to tell you that they love you the other main characteristic be motivation the motor in the brain begin to crank and you want this person and last but not least it be a obsession before I put this person in the mri machine I would ask they all kind of question but my most important question be always the same it be what percentage of the day and night do you think about this person and indeed they would say all day all night I can never stop think about he or she and then the very last question I would always have to work myself up to this question because I be not a psychologist I do not work with person in any kind of traumatic situation my final question be always the same I would say would you die for he or she and indeed this person would say yes as if I have ask they to pass the salt I be just stagger by it so we scan they brain look at a photograph of they sweetheart and look at a neutral photograph with a distraction task in between so we could look at the same brain when it be in that heighten state and when it be in a rest state and we find activity in a lot of brain region in fact one of the most important be a brain region that become active when you feel the rush of cocaine and indeed that be exactly what happen I begin to realize that romantic love be not a emotion in fact I have always think it be a series of emotion from very high to very low but actually it be a drive it come from the motor of the mind the want part of the mind the craving part of the mind the kind of part of the mind when you be reach for that piece of chocolate when you want to win that promotion at work the motor of the brain it be a drive and in fact I think it be more powerful than the sex drive you know if you ask somebody to go to bed with you and they say no thank you you certainly do not kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression but certainly around the world person who be reject in love will kill for it People live for love they kill for love they die for love they have song poem novel sculpture painting myth legend in over 175 society person have leave they evidence of this powerful brain system I have come to think it be one of the most powerful brain system on Earth for both great joy and great sorrow and I have also come to think that it be one of three basically different brain system that evolve from mating and reproduction one be the sex drive the craving for sexual gratification w h Auden call it a intolerable neural itch and indeed that be what it be it keep bother you a little bit like be hungry the second of this three brain system be romantic love that elation obsession of early love and the third brain system be attachment that sense of calm and security you can feel for a long term partner and I think that the sex drive evolve to get you out there look for a whole range of partner you can feel it when you be just drive along in you car it can be focus on nobody I think romantic love evolve to enable you to focus you mating energy on just one individual at a time thereby conserve mating time and energy and I think that attachment the third brain system evolve to enable you to tolerate this human be at least long enough to raise a child together as a team so with that preamble I want to go into discuss the two most profound social trend one of the last 10 000 year and the other certainly of the last 25 year that be go to have a impact on this three different brain system lust romantic love and deep attachment to a partner the first be woman work move into the workforce I have look at 130 society through the demographic yearbook of the United Nations everywhere in the world 129 out of 130 of they woman be not only move into the job market sometimes very very slowly but they be move into the job market and they be very slowly close that gap between man and woman in term of economic power health and education it be very slow for every trend on this planet there be a counter trend we all know of they but nevertheless the Arab say the dog may bark but the caravan move on and indeed that caravan be move on woman be move back into the job market and I say back into the job market because this be not new for million of year on the grassland of Africa woman commute to work to gather they vegetable they come home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal the double income family be the standard and woman be regard as just as economically socially and sexually powerful as man in short we be really move forward to the past then woman bad invention be the plow with the beginning of plow agriculture man role become extremely powerful woman lose they ancient job as collector but then with the industrial revolution and the post industrial revolution they be move back into the job market in short they be acquire the status that they have a million year ago 10 000 year ago 100 000 year ago we be see now one of the most remarkable tradition in the history of the human animal and it be go to have a impact I generally give a whole lecture on the impact of woman on the business community I will say just a couple of thing and then go on to sex and love there be a lot of gender difference anybody who think man and woman be alike simply never have a boy and a girl child I do not know why they want to think that man and woman be alike there be much we have in common but there be a whole lot that we do not have in common we be in the word of Ted Hughes I think that we be like two foot we need each other to get ahead but we do not evolve to have the same brain and we be find more and more gender difference in the brain I will only just use a couple and then move on to sex and love one of they be woman verbal ability woman can talk Women ability to find the right word rapidly basic articulation go up in the middle of the menstrual cycle when estrogen level peak but even at menstruation they be good than the average man woman can talk they have be do it for a million year word be woman tool they hold that baby in front of they face cajole it reprimand it educate it with word and indeed they be become a very powerful force even in place like India and Japan where woman be not move rapidly into the regular job market they be move into journalism and I think that the television be like the global campfire we sit around it and it shape we mind almost always when I be on tv the producer who call I who negotiate what we be go to say be a woman in fact Solzhenitsyn once say to have a great writer be to have another government today 54 percent of person who be writer in America be woman it be one of many many characteristic that woman have that they will bring into the job market they have get incredible person skill negotiate skill they be highly imaginative we now know the brain circuitry of imagination of long term planning they tend to be web thinker because the female part of the brain be well connect they tend to collect more piece of datum when they think put they into more complex pattern see more option and outcome they tend to be contextual holistic thinker what I call web thinker man tend to and this be average tend to get rid of what they regard as extraneous focus on what they do and move in a more step by step thinking pattern they be both perfectly good way of think we need both of they to get ahead in fact there be many more male genius in the world and there be also many more male idiot in the world laughter when the male brain work well it work extremely well and what I really think that we be do be we be move towards a collaborative society a society in which the talent of both man and woman be become understand and value and employ but in fact woman move into the job market be have a huge impact on sex and romance and family life foremost woman be start to express they sexuality I be always astonished when person come to I and say why be it that man be so adulterous why do you think more man be adulterous than woman well man be more adulterous and I say who do you think this man be sleep with laughter and basic math anyway in the western world woman start soon at sex have more partner express less remorse for the partner that they do marry later have few child leave bad marriage in order to get good one we be see the rise of female sexual expression and indeed once again we be move forward to the kind of sexual expression that we probably see on the grassland of Africa a million year ago because this be the kind of sexual expression that we see in hunting and gathering society today we be also return to a ancient form of marriage equality they be now say that the 21st century be go to be the century of what they call the symmetrical marriage or the pure marriage or the companionate marriage this be a marriage between equal move forward to a pattern that be highly compatible with the ancient human spirit we be also see a rise of romantic love 91 percent of American woman and 86 percent of American man would not marry somebody who have every single quality they be look for in a partner if they be not in love with that person person around the world in a study of 37 society want to be in love with the person that they marry indeed arrange marriage be on they way off this braid of human life I even think that marriage might even become more stable because of the second great world trend the first one be woman move into the job market the second one be the aging world population they be now say that in America that middle age should be regard as up to age 85 because in that high age category of 76 to 85 as much as 40 percent of person have nothing really wrong with they so we be see there be a real extension of middle age for one of my book I look at divorce datum in 58 society and as it turn out the old you get the less likely you be to divorce so the divorce rate right now be stable in America and it be actually begin to decline it may decline some more I would even say that with Viagra estrogen replacement hip replacement and the incredibly interesting woman woman have never be as interesting as they be now not at any time on this planet have woman be so educate so interesting so capable and so I honestly think that if there really be ever a time in human evolution when we have the opportunity to make good marriage that time be now however there be always kind of complication in this this three brain system lust romantic love and attachment do not always go together they can go together by the way that be why casual sex be not so casual with orgasm you get a spike of dopamine dopamine associate with romantic love and you can just fall in love with somebody who you be just have casual sex with with orgasm then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin that be associate with attachment this be why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you have make love to they but this three brain system lust romantic love and attachment be not always connect to each other you can feel deep attachment to a long term partner while you feel intense romantic love for somebody else while you feel the sex drive for person unrelated to this other partner in short we be capable of love more than one person at a time in fact you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feeling of attachment for one person to deep feeling of romantic love for somebody else it be as if there be a committee meeting go on in you head as you be try to decide what to do so I do not think honestly we be a animal that be build to be happy we be a animal that be build to reproduce I think the happiness we find we make and I think however we can make good relationship with each other so I want to conclude with two thing I want to conclude with a worry and with a wonderful story the worry be about antidepressant over 100 million prescription of antidepressant be write every year in the United States and this drug be go generic they be seep around the world I know one girl who be be on this antidepressant ssri serotonin enhance antidepressant since she be 13 she be 23 she be be on they ever since she be 13 I have get nothing against person who take they short term when they be go through something horrible they want to commit suicide or kill somebody else I would recommend it but more and more person in the United States be take they long term and indeed what this drug do be raise level of serotonin and by raise level of serotonin you suppress the dopamine circuit everybody know that dopamine be associate with romantic love not only do they suppress the dopamine circuit but they kill the sex drive and when you kill the sex drive you kill orgasm and when you kill orgasm you kill that flood of drug associate with attachment the thing be connect in the brain and when you tamper with one brain system you be go to tamper with another I be just simply say that a world without love be a deadly place so now applause thank you I want to end with a story and then just a comment I have be study romantic love and sex and attachment for 30 year I be a identical twin I be interested in why we be all alike why you and I be alike why the Iraqi and the Japanese and the Australian Aborigines and the person of the Amazon River be all alike and about a year ago a internet dating service Match com come to I and ask I if I would design a new dating site for they I say I do not know anything about personality you know I do not know do you think you have get the right person they say yes it get I think about why it be that you fall in love with one person rather than another that be my current project it will be my next book there be all kind of reason that you fall in love with one person rather than another timing be important proximity be important mystery be important you fall in love with somebody who be somewhat mysterious in part because mystery elevate dopamine in the brain probably push you over that threshold to fall in love you fall in love with somebody who fit within what I call you love map a unconscious list of trait that you build in childhood as you grow up and I also think that you gravitate to certain person actually with somewhat complementary brain system and that be what I be now contribute to this but I want to tell you a story to illustrate I have be carry on here about the biology of love I want to show you a little bit about the culture of it too the magic of it it be a story that be tell to I by somebody who have hear it just from one probably a true story it be a graduate student I be at Rutgers and my two colleague art Aron be at SUNY Stony Brook that be where we put we person in the mri machine and this graduate student be madly in love with another graduate student and she be not in love with he and they be all at a conference in Beijing and he know from we work that if you go and do something very novel with somebody you can drive up the dopamine in the brain and perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love laughter so he decide he would put science to work and he invite this girl to go off on a rickshaw ride with he and sure enough I have never be in one but apparently they go all around the bus and the truck and it be crazy and it be noisy and it be exciting he figure that this would drive up the dopamine and she would fall in love with he so off they go and she be squeal and squeeze he and laugh and have a wonderful time a hour later they get down off of the rickshaw and she throw she hand up and she say be not that wonderful and be not that rickshaw driver handsome laughter applause there be magic to love applause but I will end by say that million of year ago we evolve three basic drive the sex drive romantic love and attachment to a long term partner this circuit be deeply embed in the human brain they be go to survive as long as we species survive on what Shakespeare call this mortal coil thank you Chris Anderson Helen Fisher applause
