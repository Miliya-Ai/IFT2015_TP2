the old story about climate protection be that it be costly or it would have be do already so government need to make we do something painful to fix it the new story about climate protection be that it be not costly but profitable this be a simple sign error because it be cheap to save fuel than to buy fuel as be well know to company that do it all the time for example Dupont sd micro electronics many other firm IBM be reduce they energy intensity routinely six percent a year by fix up they plant and they get they money back in two or three year that be call a profit now similarly the old story about oil be that if we want to save very much of it it would be expensive or we would have do it already because market be essentially perfect if of course that be true there would be no innovation and nobody could make any money but the new story about oil be the government do not have to force we to do painful thing to get off oil not just incrementally but completely quite the contrary the United States for example can completely eliminate its use of oil and rejuvenate the economy at the same time lead by business for profit because it be so much cheap to save and substitute for the oil than to keep on buy it this process will also be catalyze by the military for its own reason of combat effectiveness and prevent conflict particularly over oil this thesis be set out in a book call win the oil endgame that four colleague and I write and have post for free at Oilendgame com about 170 000 download so far and it be co sponsor by the Pentagon it be independent it be peer review and all of the backup calculation be transparently post for you perusal now a bit of economic history I think may be helpful here around 1850 one of the big u s industry be whale and whale oil light practically every building but in the nine year before Drake strike oil in 1859 at least five sixth of that whale oil illuminate market disappear thanks to fatal competitor chiefly oil and gas make from coal to which the whaler have not be pay attention so very unexpectedly they run out of customer before they run out of whale the remnant whale population be save by technological innovator and profit maximize capitalist laughter and it be funny it feel a bit like this now for oil we have be spend the last few decade accumulate a very powerful backlog of technology for save and substitute for oil and no one have bother to add they up before so when we do we find some very surprising thing now there be two big reason to be concern about oil both national competitiveness and national security be at risk on the competitiveness front we all know that Toyota have more market cap than the big three put together and serious competition from Europe from Korea and next be China which will soon be a major net exporter of car how long do you think it will take before you can drive home you new wally badge Shanghai automotive super efficient car maybe a decade accord to my friend in Detroit China have a energy policy base on radical energy efficiency and leap frog technology they be not go to export you uncle Buick and after that come India the point here be this car be go to be make super efficient the question be who will make they will we in the United States continue to import efficient car to replace foreign oil or will we make efficient car and import neither the oil nor the car that seem to make more sense the more we keep on use the oil particularly the import oil the more we face a very obvious array of problem we analysis assume that they all cost nothing but nothing be not the right number it could well be enough to double the oil price for example and one of the bad of this be what it do to we stand in the world if other country think that everything we do be about oil if we have to treat country that have oil differently than country that do not have oil and we military get quite unhappy with have to stand guard on pipeline in Far off istan when what they actually sign up for be to protect American citizen they do not like fight over oil they do not like be in the sand and they do not like where the oil money go and what sort of instability it create now in order to avoid this problem whatever you think they be worth it be actually not that complicated we can save half the oil by use it more efficiently at a cost of 12 dollar per save barrel and then we can replace the other half with a combination of advanced bio fuel and safe natural gas and that cost on average under 18 dollar a barrel and compare with the official forecast that oil will cost 26 dollar a barrel in 2025 which be half of what we have be pay lately that will save 70 billion dollar a year start quite soon now in order to do this we need to invest about 180 billion dollar half of it to retool the car truck and plane industry half of it to build the advanced bio fuel industry in the process we will gain about a million good job mainly rural and protect another million job now at risk mainly in auto make and we will also get return over 150 billion dollar a year so that be a very handsome return it be financeable in the private capital market but if you want it for the reason I just mention to happen soon and with high confidence then and also to expand choice and manage risk then you might like some light handed public policy that support rather than distort or oppose the business logic and this policy work fine without tax subsidy or mandate they make a little net money for the treasury they have a broad trans ideological appeal and because we want they actually to happen we figure out way to do they that do not require much if any federal legislation and can indeed be do administratively or at a state level just to illustrate what to do about the nub of the problem namely light vehicle here be four ultra light carbon composite concept car with low drag and all but the one at the upper left have hybrid drive you can sort of have it all with this thing for example this Opel two seater do 155 mile a hour at 94 mile a gallon this muscle car from Toyota 408 horsepower in a ultra light that do zero to 60 in well under four second and still get 32 mile a gallon I will say more later about this and in the upper leave a pioneering effort 14 year ago by GM 84 mile a gallon without even use a hybrid in a four seater well save that fuel 69 percent of the fuel in light vehicle cost about 57 cent per save gallon but it be even a good deal for heavy truck where you save a similar amount at 25 cent a gallon with good aerodynamics and tire and engine and so on and take out weight so you can put it into payload so you can double efficiency with a 60 percent internal rate of return then you can go even far almost triple efficiency with some operational improvement double the big hauler margin and we intend to use that number to create demand pull and flip the market in the airplane business it be again a similar story where the first 20 percent fuel save be free as Boeing be now demonstrate in its new Dreamliner but then the next generation of plane save about half again much cheap than buy the fuel and if you go over the next 15 year or so to a blended wing body kind of a fly wing with internal engine then you get about a factor three efficiency improvement at comparable or low cost let I focus a minute on the light vehicle the car and light truck because we all know the most about that probably everybody here drive one and yet we may not realize that in a standard sedan of all the fuel energy you feed into the car seven eighth never get to the wheel it be lose first in the engine idle at zero mile a gallon the power train and accessory so then of the energy that do get to the wheel only a eighth of it half of that go to heat the tire on the road or to heat the air the car push aside and only this little bit only six percent actually end up accelerate the car and then heat the brake when you stop in fact since 95 percent of the weight you be move be the car not the driver less than one percent of the fuel energy end up move the driver this be not very gratifying after more than a century of devoted engineering effort laughter applause moreover three fourth of the fuel use be cause by the weight of the car and it be obvious from the diagram that every unit of energy you save at the wheel be go to avoid waste another seven unit of energy get that energy to the wheel so there be huge leverage for make the car a lot light and the reason this have not be very seriously examine before be there be a common assumption in the industry that well then it might not be safe if you get whack by a heavy car and it would cost a lot more to make because the only way we know how to make car much light be to use expensive light metal like aluminum and magnesium but this objection be now vanish through advance in material for example we use a lot of carbon fiber composite in sporting goods and it turn out that this be quite remarkable for safety here be a handmade McLaren slr carbon car that get t bone by a Golf the Golf be total the McLaren just pop off and scratch the side panel they will pop it back on and fix the scratch later but if this McLaren be to run into a wall at 65 mile a hour the entire crash energy would be absorb by a couple of weave carbon fiber composite cone weigh a total of 15 pound hide in the front end because this material could actually absorb six to 12 time as much energy per pound as steel and do so a lot more smoothly and this mean we have just crack the conundrum of safety and weight we could make car big which be protective but make they light whereas if we make they heavy they would be both hostile and inefficient and when you make they light in the right way that can be simple and cheap to make you can end up save money and life and oil all at the same time I show here two year ago a little bit about a design of you basic uncompromised quintuple efficiency suburban assault vehicle laughter and this be a complete virtual design that be production cost manufacturable and the process need to make it be actually come toward the market quite nicely we figure out a kind of a digital inkjet printer for this very stiff strong carbon composite material and then way to thermoform it because it be a combination of carbon and nylon into whatever complex shape you want like the one just show at the auto show by one of the tier one supplier and the manufacturing you can do this way get radically simplify because the auto body have only say 14 part instead of 100 150 each one be form by one fairly cheap die set instead of four expensive one for stamp steel each of the part can be easily lift with no hoist they snap together like a kid toy so you get rid of the body shop and if you want you can lay color in the mold and get rid of the paint shop that be the two hard and costly part of make a car so you end up with at least two fifth low capital intensity than the lean plant in the industry which GM have in Lansing the plant also get small now when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil include building industry feedstock and so on you find that of the 28 million barrel a day the government say we will need in 2025 well about eight of that can be remove by efficiency by then with another seven still be save as the vehicle stock turn over at a average cost of only 12 buck a barrel instead of 26 for buy the oil and then another six can be make robustly competitively from cellulosic ethanol and a little bio diesel without interfere at all with the water or land need of crop production there be a huge amount of gas to be save about half the project gas at about a eighth of its price and here be some no brainer substitution of it with lot leave over so much in fact that after you have handle the domestic oil forecast from area already approve you have only this little bit left and let see how we can meet that because there be a pretty flexible menu of way we could of course buy more efficiency maybe you ought to buy efficiency at 26 buck instead of 12 or wait to capture the second half of it or we could of course just get this little bit by continue to import some Canadian and Mexican oil or the ethanol the Brazilian would love to sell we but they will sell it to Japan and China instead because we have tariff barrier to protect we corn farmer and they do not or we could use the save gas directly to cover all of this balance or if we use it as hydrogen which be more profitable and efficient we have get rid of the domestic oil too and that do not even count for example that available land in the Dakotas can cost effectively make enough wind power to run every highway vehicle in the country so we have lot of option and the choice of menu and timing be quite flexible now to make this happen quick and with high confidence there be a few way government could help for example fee bate a combination of a fee and a rebate in any size class of vehicle you want can increase the price of inefficient vehicle and correspondingly pay you a rebate for efficient vehicle you be not pay to change size class you be pay to pick efficiency within a size class in a way equivalent to look at all fourteen year of life cycle fuel savings rather than just the first two or three this expand choice rapidly in the market and actually make more money for automaker as well I would like to deal with the lack of affordable personal mobility in this country by make it very cheaply possible for low income family to get efficient reliable warranted new car that they could otherwise never get and for each car so finance scrap almost one clunker preferably the dirty one this create a new million car a year market for Detroit from customer they be not go to get otherwise because they be not creditworthy and could never afford a new car and Detroit will make money on every unit it turn out that if say African American and white household have the same car ownership it would cut employment disparity about in half by provide good access to job opportunity so this be a huge social win too government buy hundred of thousand of car a year there be smart way to buy they and to aggregate that purchase power to bring very efficient vehicle into the market fast and we could even do a X Prize style golden carrot that be worth stretch further for for example a billion dollar prize for the first u s automaker to sell 200 000 really advanced vehicle like some you see early then the legacy airline can not afford to buy the efficient new plane they desperately need to cut they fuel bill but if you feel philosophically you want to do anything about that there be way to finance it and at the same time to scrap inefficient old plane so that if they be otherwise to come back in the air they would waste more oil and block the uptake of efficient new plane that part inefficient plane be worth more to society dead than alive we ought to take they out back and shoot they and put bounty hunter after they then there be a important military role that in create the move to high volume low cost commercial production of this kind of material or for that matter ultra light steel that be a good backup technology the military can do the trick it do in turn DARPAnet into the internet just turn it over to the private sector and we have a internet the same for GPS the same for the modern semi conductor industry that be military science and technology that they need can create the advanced material industrial cluster that transform its civilian economy and get the country off oil which would be a huge contribution to eliminate conflict over oil and advance national and global security then we need to retool the car industry and do retrain and shift the convergence of the energy and ag value chain to shift fast from hydrocarbon to carbohydrate and get out of we own way in other way and make the transition to more efficient vehicle go fast but here be how the whole thing fit together instead of official forecast of oil use and oil import go forever up they can turn down with the 12 dollar a barrel efficiency down steeply by add the supply side substitution at 18 buck all implement at slow rate than we have do before when we pay attention and if we start add tranch of hydrogen in there we be rapidly off import and completely off oil in the 2040 and the one thing I would like to point out here be that we have do this before in this eight year period 1977 to 85 when we last pay attention the economy grow 27 percent oil use fall 17 percent oil import fall 50 percent oil import from the Persian Gulf fall 87 percent they would have be go if we have keep that up one more year well that be with very old technology and delivery method we could rerun that play a lot good now and yet what we prove then be the U S have more market power than OPEC Ours be on the demand side we be the Saudi Arabia of nega barrel laughter we can use less oil fast than they can conveniently sell less oil applause whatever you reason for want to do this whether you be concern about national security or price volatility laughter or job or the planet or you grand kid it seem to I that this be a oil endgame that we should all be play to win please download you copy and thank you very much applause
