Sheryl Shade Hi Aimee Aimee Mullins Hi SS Aimee and I think we would just talk a little bit and I want she to tell all of you what make she a distinctive athlete AM Well for that of you who have see the picture in the little bio it might have give it away I be a double amputee and I be bear without fibula in both leg I be amputate at age one and I have be run like hell ever since all over the place SS well why do not you tell they how you get to Georgetown why do not we start there why do not we start there be I be a senior in Georgetown in the Foreign Service program I win a full academic scholarship out of high school they pick three student out of the nation every year to get involve in international affair and so I win a full ride to Georgetown and I have be there for four year love it SS when Aimee get there she decide that she be kind of curious about track and field so she decide to call someone and start ask about it so why do not you tell that story be yeah well I guess I have always be involve in sport I play softball for five year grow up I ski competitively throughout high school and I get a little restless in college because I be not do anything for about a year or two sport wise and I have never compete on a disabled level you know I have always compete against other able bodied athlete that be all I have ever know in fact I would never even meet another amputee until I be 17 and I hear that they do this track meet with all disabled runner and I figure oh I do not know about this but before I judge it let I go see what it be all about so I book myself a flight to Boston in 95 19 year old and definitely the dark horse candidate at this race I have never do it before I go out on a gravel track a couple of week before this meet to see how far I could run and about 50 meter be enough for I panting and heaving and I have this leg that be make of a wood and plastic compound attach with velcro strap big thick five ply wool sock on you know not the most comfortable thing but all I have ever know and I be up there in Boston against person wear leg make of all thing carbon graphite and you know shock absorber in they and all sort of thing and they be all look at I like ok we know who be not go to win this race and I mean I go up there expect I do not know what I be expect but you know when I see a man who be miss a entire leg go up to the high jump hop on one leg to the high jump and clear it at six foot two inch Dan O Brien jump 5 11 in 96 in Atlanta I mean if it just give you a comparison of this be truly accomplish athlete without qualify that word athlete and so I decide to give this a shot heart pound I run my first race and I beat the national record holder by three hundredth of a second and become the new national record holder on my first try out and you know person say Aimee you know you have get speed you have get natural speed but you do not have any skill or finesse go down that track you be all over the place we all see how hard you be work and so I decide to call the track coach at Georgetown and I thank god I do not know just how huge this man be in the track and field world he be coach five Olympian and the man office be line from floor to ceiling with all America certificate of all this athlete he be coach he be just a rather intimidating figure and I call he up and say listen I run one race and I win laughter I want to see if I can you know I need to just see if I can sit in on some of you practice see what drill you do and whatever that be all I want just two practice can I just sit in and see what you do and he say well we should meet first before we decide anything you know he be think what be I get myself into so I meet the man walk in he office and see this poster and magazine cover of person he have coach and we get to talk and it turn out to be a great partnership because he have never coach a disabled athlete so therefore he have no preconceived notion of what I be or be not capable of and I would never be coach before so this be like here we go let start on this trip so he start give I four day a week of he lunch break he free time and I would come up to the track and train with he so that be how I meet Frank that be fall of 95 but then by the time that winter be roll around he say you know you be good enough you can run on we woman track team here and I say no come on and he say no no really you can you can run with we woman track team in the spring of 1996 with my goal of make the U S Paralympic team that May come up full speed I join the woman track team and no disabled person have ever do that run at a collegiate level so I do not know it start to become a interesting mix ss well on you way to the Olympics a couple of memorable event happen at Georgetown why do not you just tell they be yes well you know I have win everything as far as the disabled meet everything I compete in and you know training in Georgetown and know that I be go to have to get use to see the back of all this woman shirt you know I be run against the next Flo Jo and they be all look at I like hmm what be you know what be go on here and put on my Georgetown uniform and go out there and know that you know in order to become well and I be already the good in the country you know you have to train with person who be inherently good than you and I go out there and make it to the Big East which be sort of the championship race at the end of the season it be really really hot and it be the first I have just get this new sprinting leg that you see in that bio and I do not realize at that time that the amount of sweat I would be do in the sock it actually act like a lubricant and I would be kind of piston in the socket and at about 85 meter of my 100 meter sprint in all my glory I come out of my leg like I almost come out of it in front of like 5 000 person and I I mean be just mortify because I be sign up for the 200 you know which go off in a half hour laughter I go to my coach please do not make I do this I can not do this in front of all that person my leg will come off and if it come off at 85 there be no way I be go 200 meter and he just sit there like this my plea fall on deaf ear thank god because you know the man be from Brooklyn he be a big man he say Aimee so what if you leg fall off you pick it up you put the damn thing back on and finish the goddamn race laughter applause and I do so he keep I in line he keep I on the right track ss so then Aimee make it to the 1996 Paralympics and she be all excited she family come down it be a big deal it be now two year that you have be run be no a year SS a year and why do not you tell they what happen right before you go run you race be okay well Atlanta the Paralympics just for a little bit of clarification be the Olympics for person with physical disability amputee person with cerebral palsy and wheelchair athlete as oppose to the Special Olympics which deal with person with mental disability so here we be a week after the Olympics and down at Atlanta and I be just blow away by the fact that just a year ago I get out on a gravel track and could not run 50 meter and so here I be never lose I set new record at the U S Nationals the Olympic trial that May and be sure that I be come home with the gold I be also the only what they call bilateral BK below the knee I be the only woman who would be do the long jump I have just do the long jump and a guy who be miss two leg come up to I and say how do you do that you know we be suppose to have a planar foot so we can not get off on the springboard I say well I just do it no one tell I that so it be funny I be three inch within the world record and keep on from that point you know so I be sign up in the long jump sign up no I make it for the long jump and the 100 meter and I be sure of it you know I make the front page of my hometown paper that I deliver for six year you know it be like this be my time for shine and we be at the trainee warm up track which be a few block away from the Olympic stadium this leg that I be on which I will take out right now I be the first person in the world on this leg I be the guinea pig I be tell you this be like talk about a tourist attraction everyone be take picture what be this girl run on and I be always look around like where be my competition it be my first international meet I try to get it out of anybody I could you know who be I run against here oh Aimee we will have to get back to you on that one I want to find out time do not worry you be do great this be 20 minute before my race in the Olympic stadium and they post the heat sheet and I go over and look and my fast time which be the world record be 15 77 then I be look the next lane lane two be 12 8 Lane three be 12 5 Lane four be 12 2 I say what be go on and they shove we all into the shuttle bus and all the woman there be miss a hand laughter so I be just like they be all look at I like which one of this be not like the other you know I be sit there like oh my god oh my god you know I would never lose anything like whether it would be the scholarship or you know I have win five gold when I ski in everything I come in first and Georgetown that be great I be lose but it be the good training because this be Atlanta here we be like cr I de la cr I and there be no doubt about it that I be go to lose big and you know I be just think oh my god my whole family get in a van and drive down here from Pennsylvania and you know I be the only female u s sprinter so they call we out and you know lady you have one minute and I remember put my block in and just feel horrified because there be just this murmur come over the crowd like the one who be close enough to the start line to see and I be like I know look this be not right and I be think that be my last card to play here if I be not go to beat this girl I be go to mess they head a little you know laughter I mean it be definitely the Rocky IV sensation of I versus Germany and everyone else Estonia and Poland be in this heat and the gun go off and all I remember be finish last and fight back tear of frustration and incredible incredible this feeling of just be overwhelmed and I have to think why do I do this if I have win everything but it be like what be the point all this training I have transform my life I become a collegiate athlete you know I become a Olympic athlete and it make I really think about how the achievement be get there I mean the fact that I set my sight just a year and three month before on become a Olympic athlete and say here be my life go in this direction and I want to take it here for a while and just see how far I could push it and the fact that I ask for help how many person jump on board how many person give of they time and they expertise and they patience to deal with I and that be this collective glory that there be you know 50 person behind I that have join in this incredible experience of go to Atlanta so I apply this sort of philosophy now to everything I do sit back and realize the progression how far you have come at this day to this goal you know it be important to focus on a goal I think but also recognize the progression on the way there and how you have grow as a person that be the achievement I think that be the real achievement ss why do not you show they you leg be oh sure ss you know show we more than one set of leg am well this be my pretty leg laughter no this be my cosmetic leg actually and they be absolutely beautiful you have get to come up and see they there be hair follicle on they and I can paint my toenail and seriously like I can wear heel like you guy do not understand what that be like to be able to just go into a shoe store and buy whatever you want SS you get to pick you height be I get to pick my height exactly laughter Patrick Ewing who play for Georgetown in the 80 come back every summer and I have incessant fun make fun of he in the training room because he have come in with foot injury I be like get it off do not worry about it you know you can be eight foot tall just take they off laughter he do not find it as humorous as I do anyway ok now this be my sprinting leg make of carbon graphite like I say and I have get to make sure I have get the right socket no I have get so many leg in here this be do you want to hold that actually that be another leg I have for like tennis and softball it have a shock absorber in it so it like Shhhh make this neat sound when you jump around on it all right and then this be the silicon sheath I roll over to keep it on which when I sweat you know I be piston out of it SS be you a different height be in this ss in this am I do not know I do not think so I may be a little tall I actually can put both of they on SS she can not really stand on this leg she have to be move so be yeah I definitely have to be move and balance be a little bit of a art in they but without have the silicon sock I be just go to try slip in it and so I run on this and have shock half the world on this applause this be suppose to simulate the actual form of a sprinter when they run if you ever watch a sprinter the ball of they foot be the only thing that ever hit the track so when I stand in this leg my hamstring and my glute be contract as they would be have I have foot and be stand on the ball of my foot audience who make they be it be a company in San Diego call flex foot and I be a guinea pig as I hope to continue to be in every new form of prosthetic limb that come out but actually this like I say be still the actual prototype I need to get some new one because the last meet I be at they be everywhere you know it be like a big it be come full circle Moderator Aimee and the designer of they will be at tedm 2 and we will talk about the design of they be yes we will do that SS Yes there you go am so this be the sprint leg and I can put my other ss can you tell about who design you other leg be yes this I get in a place call Bournemouth England about two hour south of London and I be the only person in the United States with this which be a crime because they be so beautiful and I do not even mean like because of the toe and everything for I while I be such a serious athlete on the track I want to be feminine off the track and I think it be so important not to be limit in any capacity whether it be you know you mobility or even fashion I mean I love the fact that I can go in anywhere and pick out what I want the shoe I want the skirt I want and I be hope to try to bring this over here and make they accessible to a lot of person they be also silicon this be a really basic basic prosthetic limb under here it be like a Barbie foot under this laughter it be it be just stick in this position so I have to wear a two inch heel and I mean it be really let I take this off so you can see it I do not know how good you can see it but like it really be there be vein on the foot and then my heel be pink and my Achilles tendon that move a little bit and it be really a amazing store I get they a year and two week ago and this be just a silicon piece of skin I mean what happen be two year ago this man in Belgium be say God if I can go to Madame Tussauds wax museum and see Jerry Hall replicate down to the color of she eye look so real as if she breathe why can not they build a limb for someone that look like a leg or a arm or a hand I mean they make ear for burn victim they do amazing stuff with silicon ss two week ago Aimee be up for the Arthur Ashe award at the ESPYs and she come into town and she rush around and she say I have to buy some new shoe we be a hour before the ESPYs and she think she would get a two inch heel but she would actually buy a three inch heel am and this pose a problem for I because it mean I be walk like that all night long SS for 45 minute luckily the hotel be terrific they get someone to come in and see off the shoe laughter be I say to the receptionist I mean I be just harry and Sheryl at my side I say look do you have anybody here who could help I because I have this problem you know at first they be just go to write I off like if you do not like you shoe sorry it be too late no no no no I have get this special foot that need a two inch heel I have a three inch heel I need a little
