this be the first of two rather extraordinary photograph I be go to show you today it be take 18 year ago I be 19 year old at the time I have just return from one of the deep dive I would ever make at that time a little over 200 foot and I have catch this little fish it turn out that particular one be the first of its kind ever take alive I be not just a ichthyologist I be a bona fide fish nerd and to a fish nerd this be some pretty exciting stuff more exciting be the fact that the person who take this photo be a guy name Jack Randall the great living ichthyologist on earth the Grand Poobah of fish nerd if you will and so it be really exciting to I to have this moment in time it set the course for the rest of my life but really the most significant most profound thing about this picture be it be take two day before I be completely paralyze from the neck down I make a really stupid kind of mistake that most 19 year old male do when they think they be immortal and I get a bad case of the bend and be paralyzed and have to be fly back for treatment I learn two really important thing that day the first thing I learn well I be mortal that be a really big one and the second thing I learn be that I know with profound certainty that this be exactly what I be go to do for the rest of my life I have to focus all my energy towards go to find new species of thing down on deep coral reef when you think of a coral reef this be what most person think of this big hard elaborate coral lot of bright colorful fish and thing but this be really just the tip of the iceberg if you look at this diagram of a coral reef we know a lot about that part up near the top the reason we know so much about it be scuba diver can very easily go down there and access it there be a problem with scuba though in that it impose some limitation on how deep you can go it turn out that depth be about 200 foot I will get into why that be in just a minute but the point be scuba diver generally stay less than 100 foot deep and very rarely go much below this at least not with any kind of sanity so to go deep most biologist have turn to submersible now submersible be great wonderful thing but if you be go to spend 30 000 dollar a day to use one of this thing and it be capable of go 2 000 foot you be not go to go fart around up here in a couple of hundred foot you be go to go way down deep so the bottom line be almost all research use submersible have take place well below 500 foot now it be pretty obvious at this point there be a zone here in the middle that be the zone that center around my own personal pursuit of happiness I want to find out what be in this zone we know almost nothing about it Scuba diver can not get there submarine go right on past it it take I a year to learn to walk again after my diving accident in Palau during that year I spend a lot of time learn about the physics and physiology of diving and how to overcome this limitation I be just go to show you a basic idea we be all breathing air right now Air be a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen 20 percent oxygen 80 percent nitrogen it be in we lung and there be a phenomenon call Henry law that say gas will dissolve into a fluid in proportion to the partial pressure you be expose they to so basically the gas dissolve into we body the oxygen be bind by metabolism we use it for energy the nitrogen sort of float around in we blood and tissue that be fine it be how we be design the problem happen when you go underwater the deep you go underwater the high the pressure be if you be to go down to a depth of about 130 foot which be the recommend limit for most scuba diver you would get this pressure effect the effect of that pressure be you have a increase density of gas molecule in every breath you take over time that gas molecule dissolve into you blood and tissue and start to fill you up now if you be to go down to say 300 foot you do not have five time as many gas molecule in you lung you have get 10 time as many gas molecule in you lung and sure enough they dissolve into you blood and tissue as well and if you be to go down to where there be 15 time as much the deep you go the more exacerbate the problem become the limitation of diving with air be all that dot in you body all the nitrogen and all the oxygen there be three basic limitation of scuba diving the first limitation be the oxygen oxygen toxicity now we all know the song love be like oxygen you get too much you get too high not enough and you be go to die well in the context of diving you get too much you die also you die because oxygen toxicity can cause a seizure it make you convulse underwater not a good thing to happen underwater it happen because there be too much concentration of oxygen in you body the nitrogen have two problem one of they be what Jacques Cousteau call rapture of the deep it be nitrogen narcosis it make you loopy the deep you go the loopy you get you do not want to drive drunk you do not want to dive drunk so that be a real big problem and of course the third problem be the one I find out the hard way in Palau which be the bend one thing I forget to mention be that to obviate the problem of nitrogen narcosis all of that blue dot in we body you remove the nitrogen and replace it with helium Helium a gas there be a lot of reason why helium good it be a tiny molecule it be inert it do not give you narcosis so that be the basic concept we use but the theory relatively easy the tricky part be the implementation so this be how I begin about 15 year ago I will admit it be not exactly the smart of start but you have get to start somewhere laughter at the time I be not the only one who do not know what I be do almost nobody do this rig be actually use for a dive of 300 foot but over time we get good at it and we come up with this really sophisticated look rig with four scuba tank five regulator and all the right gas mixture all that good stuff it be fine and dandy it allow we to go down and find new species this picture be take at 300 foot catch new species of fish the problem be it do not allow we much time for all its bulk and size it only give we about 15 minute at most down at that sort of depths we need more time there have to be a good way and indeed there be a good way in 1994 I be fortunate enough to get access to this prototype close circuit rebreather close circuit rebreather what make it different from scuba and why be it good well there be three main advantage to a rebreather one they be quiet they do not make any noise two they allow you to stay underwater long Three they allow you to go deep how be it that they do that in order to really understand how they do that you have to look underneath the hood and see what be go on there be three basic system to a closed circuit rebreather the most fundamental be call the breathing loop it be a breathing loop because you breathe off of it it be a closed loop and you breathe the same gas around and around there be a mouthpiece that you put in you mouth and there be a counter lung or in this case two counter lung the counter lung be not high tech they be simply flexible bag they allow you to mechanically breathe mechanically ventilate when you exhale it go in the exhale counter lung when you inhale it come from the inhale counter lung it be just pure mechanic allow you to cycle air through this breathing loop the other component on a breathing loop be the carbon dioxide absorbent canister now as we breathe we produce carbon dioxide and that carbon dioxide need to be scrub out of the system there be a chemical filter in there that pull the carbon dioxide out of the breathing gas so that when it come back to we it be safe to breathe again that be the breathing loop in a nutshell the second main component of a closed circuit rebreather be the gas system the primary purpose of the gas system be to provide oxygen to replenish the oxygen that you body consume so the main tank the main critical thing be this oxygen gas supply cylinder we have here but if we only have a oxygen gas supply cylinder we would not be able to go very deep because we have run into oxygen toxicity very quickly so we need another gas something to dilute the oxygen with and that fittingly enough be call the diluent gas supply in we application we generally put air inside this diluent gas supply because it be a very cheap and easy source of nitrogen so that be where we get we nitrogen from but if we want to go deep of course we need another gas supply and helium be what we really need to go deep usually we will have a slightly large cylinder mount exterior on the rebreather like this that be what we use to inject as we start to do we deep dive we also have a second oxygen cylinder solely as a backup if there be a problem with we first oxygen supply we can continue to breathe the way you manage all this different gas and different gas supply be this really high tech sophisticated gas block up on the front here where it be easy to reach it be get the valve and knob and thing you need to inject the right gas at the right time normally you do not have to do that because all of it be do automatically with the electronics the third system of a rebreather the most critical part of a rebreather be the oxygen sensor you need three so if one go bad you know which one it be you need vote logic you also have three microprocessor any one of that computer can run the entire system so if you have to lose two of they there be back up power supply and there be multiple display to get the information to the diver this be the high tech gadgetry that allow we to do what we do on this deep dive I can talk about it all day just ask my wife but I want to move on to something much more interesting I be go to take you on a deep dive and show you what it be like to do one we start up on the boat for all this high tech expensive equipment this be still the good way to get in the water just flop over the side of the boat now as I show you in the early diagram this reef that we dive on start out near the surface and they go almost vertically completely straight down so we drop in the water and go over the edge of this cliff and then we start drop drop drop person ask if it take a long time to get there no it only take a couple minute to get down to three or four hundred foot which be what we be aim for it be like skydive in slow motion it be really very interesting you ever see the abyss where Ed Harris be sink down along the side of the wall that be what it feel like amazing and down there you find that the water be very clear extremely clear because there be hardly any plankton when you turn on you light and look around the cave you be confront with a tremendous amount of diversity much more than anyone use to believe now not all of it be new species that fish you see with the white stripe that be a know species but if you look carefully into the crack and crevice you will see little thing scurry all over the place there be a just unbelievable diversity it be not just fish either this be crinoid sponge black coral there be some more fish that fish that you see now be new species they be still new species because I have a video camera instead of my net so they be still wait down there for someone to go find they but this be what it look like and this kind of habitat just go on and on and on for mile this be Papua New Guinea now little fish and invertebrate be not the only thing we see down there we also see shark much more regularly than I would have expect to we be not quite sure why what I want you to do now be imagine yourself 400 foot underwater with all this high tech gear on you back you be in a remote reef off Papua New Guinea thousand of mile from the near recompression chamber and you be completely surround by shark video diver 1 in squeaky voice look at that diver 2 uh oh uh oh audience laughter video diver 1 I think we have they attention Richard Pyle when you start talk like Donald duck there be no situation in the world that can seem tense laughter so we be down there this be at 400 foot that be look straight up by the way to give a sense of how far the surface be and if you be a biologist and know about shark and you want to assess how much jeopardy be I really in here there be one question that sort of jump to the forefront of you mind immediately which be video diver 1 what kind of shark diver 2 silvertip shark diver 1 oh rp there be actually three species of shark here the silvertip be the one with the white edge on the fin and there be also gray reef shark and hammerhead off in the distance and yes it be a little nerve rack video diver 2 Hoo that little guy be frisky audience laughter now you have see video like this on tv a lot and it be very intimidating I think it give the wrong impression about shark they be actually not very dangerous animal that be why we be not worried much and be joke around more person be kill by pig by lightning strike more person be kill at soccer game in England there be a lot of other way you can die and I be not make that stuff up Coconuts you can get kill by a coconut more likely than kill by a shark so shark be not quite as dangerous as most person make they out to be now I do not know if any of you get US News and World Report I get the recent issue there be a cover story about the great explorer of we time the last article be entitle no New Frontiers it question whether or not there really be any new frontier out there whether there be any true hardcore discovery that can still be make my favorite line from the article discovery can mean find a guppy with a extra spine in its dorsal fin I have to laugh they do not call we fish nerd for nothing we actually do get excited about find a new dorsal spine in a guppy but it be much more than that I want to show you a few of the guppy we have find over the year this one you can see how ugly it be laughter even if you ignore the scientific value of this thing look at the monetary value of this thing a couple of this be sell through the aquarium trade to Japan where they sell for 15 000 dollar apiece that be half a million dollar a pound here be another new angelfish we discover this one we first discover back in the air day the bad old air day when we be do this kind of dive with air we be at 360 foot I remember come up from one of this deep dive and I have this fog and the narcosis take a little while to fade away sort of like sobering up I have this vague recollection of see this yellow fish with a black spot and think Damn I should have catch one I think that be a new species eventually I look in my bucket sure enough I have catch one I just completely forget so this one we decide to give the name Centropyge narcosis to that be its official scientific name in reference to its deep dwelling habit this be another neat one when we first find it we be not even sure what family it belong to so we just call it the Dr Seuss fish since it look like something from one of that book now this one pretty cool if you go to Papua New Guinea and go down 300 foot you will see this big mound this may be hard to see but they be a couple meter in diameter if you look closely you will see there be a little white and gray fish that hang out near they it turn out this little white fish build this giant mound one pebble at a time it be extraordinary to find something like this it be not just new species it be new behavior new ecology all kind of new thing what I be go to show you now quickly be a sampling of the new species we have discover what be extraordinary be not just the number of species we be find though as you can see that be pretty amazing this be only half of what we have find what be extraordinary be how quickly we find they we be up to seven new species per hour of time we spend at that depth if you go to a Amazon jungle and fog a tree you may get a lot of bug but for fish there be nowhere in the world you can get seven new species per hour of time now we have do some back of the envelope calculation and we be predict there be probably about 2 000 to 2 500 new species in the Indo Pacific alone there be only five to six thousand know species so a very large percentage of what be out there be not really know we think we have a handle on all the reef fish diversity evidently not I be go to just close on a very somber note at the beginning I say I would show you two extraordinary photograph this be the second extraordinary photograph I be go to show you this one be take at the exact moment I be down there film that shark this be take exactly 300 foot above my head the reason this photograph be extraordinary be because it capture a moment in the very last minute of a person life less than 60 second after this picture be take this guy be dead when we recover he body we figure out what have go wrong he have make a very simple mistake he turn the wrong valve when he fill he cylinder he have 80 percent oxygen in he tank when he should have have 40 he have a oxygen toxicity seizure and he drown the reason I show this not to put a downer on everything but I just want to use it to key off my philosophy of life in general which be that we all have two goal the first goal we share with every other live thing on this planet which be to survive I call it perpetuation the survival of the species and survival of ourselves and that be both about perpetuate the genome the second goal for that of we who have master the first goal call it spiritual fulfillment call it financial success you can call it any number of different thing I call it seek joy this pursuit of happiness so I guess my theme on this be this guy live he life to the ful he absolutely do you have to balance that two goal if you live you whole life in fear I mean life be a sexually transmit disease with 100 percent mortality so you can not live you life in fear laughter I think that be a old one applause but at the same time you do not want to get so focused on rule number two goal number two that you neglect goal number one because once you be dead you really can not enjoy anything after that so I wish you all the good of luck in maintain that balance in you future endeavor thanks
