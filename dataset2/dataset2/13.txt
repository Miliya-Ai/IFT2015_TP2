I be really excited to be here today I will show you some stuff that be just ready to come out of the lab literally and I be really glad that you guy be go to be among the first to see it in person because I really think this be go to really change the way we interact with machine from this point on now this be a rear project drafting table it be about 36 inch wide and it be equip with a multi touch sensor normal touch sensor that you see like on a kiosk or interactive whiteboard can only register one point of contact at a time this thing allow you to have multiple point at the same time they can use both my hand I can use chording action I can just go right up and use all 10 finger if I want to you know like that now multi touch sense be not completely new person like Bill Buxton have be play around with it in the 80 however the approach I build here be actually high resolution low cost and probably most importantly very scalable so the technology you know be not the most exciting thing here right now other than probably its newfound accessibility what be really interesting here be what you can do with it and the kind of interface you can build on top of it so let see so for instance we have a lava lamp application here now you can see I can use both of my hand to kind of squeeze and put the blob together I can inject heat into the system here or I can pull it apart with two of my finger it be completely intuitive there be no instruction manual the interface just kind of disappear this start out as a screensaver app that one of the ph d student in we lab Ilya Rosenberg make but I think its true identity come out here now what be great about a multi touch sensor be that you know I could be do this with as many finger here but of course multi touch also inherently mean multi user Chris could be interact with another part of lava while I play around with it here you can imagine a new kind of sculpt tool where I be kind of warm something up make it malleable and then let it cool down and solidify in a certain state Google should have something like this in they lobby laughter I will show you a little more of a concrete example here as this thing load this be a photographer light box application again I can use both of my hand to interact and move photo around but what be even cool be that if I have two finger I can actually grab a photo and then stretch it out like that really easily I can pan zoom and rotate it effortlessly I can do that grossly with both of my hand or I can do it just with two finger on each of my hand together if I grab the canvas I can do the same thing stretch it out I can do it simultaneously hold this down and grip on another one stretch this out again the interface just disappear here there be no manual this be exactly what you expect especially if you have not interact with a computer before now when you have initiative like the 100 laptop I kind of cringe at the idea of introduce a whole new generation to compute with this standard mouse and window pointer interface this be something that I think be really the way we should be interact with machine from now on applause now of course I can bring up a keyboard laughter and I can bring that around put that up there obviously this be a standard keyboard but of course I can rescale it to make it work well for my hand that be really important because there be no reason in this day and age that we should be conform to a physical device that lead to bad thing like RSI we have so much technology nowadays that this interface should start conform to we there be so little apply now to actually improve the way we interact with interface from this point on this keyboard be probably actually the really wrong direction to go you can imagine in the future as we develop this kind of technology a keyboard that kind of automatically drift as you hand move away and really intelligently anticipate which key you be try to stroke so again be not this great laughter audience where be you lab Jeff Han I be a research scientist at NYU in New York here be a example of another kind of app I can make this little fuzz ball it will remember the stroke I be make of course I can do it with all my hand it be pressure sensitive what be neat about that be I show that two finger gesture that zoom in really quickly because you do not have to switch to a hand tool or the magnifying glass tool you can just continuously make thing in real multiple scale all at the same time I can create big thing out here but I can go back and really quickly go back to where I start and make even small thing here this be go to be really important as we start get to thing like datum visualization for instance I think we all enjoy Hans Rosling talk and he really emphasize the fact I have be think about for a long time we have all this great datum but for some reason it be just sit there we be not access it and one of the reason why I think that be will be help by thing like graphic and visualization and inference tool but I also think a big part of it be go to be have well interface to be able to drill down into this kind of datum while still think about the big picture here let I show you another app here this be call WorldWind it be do by NASA we have all see Google Earth this be a open source version of that there be plug in to be able to load in different datum set that NASA collect over the year as you can see I can use the same two finger gesture to go down and go in really seamlessly there be no interface again it really allow anybody to kind of go in and it just do what you would expect you know again there be just no interface here the interface just disappear I can switch to different datum view that be what be neat about this app here NASA really cool this hyper spectral image be false color so you can it be really good for determine vegetative use well let go back to this the great thing about mapping application it be not really 2d it be 3d so again with a multi point interface you can do a gesture like this so you can be able to tilt around like that surprised laughter it be not just simply relegate to a kind of 2d pan and motion this gesture be just put two finger down it be define a axis of tilt and I can tilt up and down that way we just come up with that on the spot it be probably not the right thing to do but there be such interesting thing you can do with this interface it be just so much fun play around with it too laughter and so the last thing I want to show you be I be sure we can all think of a lot of entertainment app that you can do with this thing I be more interested in the creative application we can do with this now here be a simple application here I can draw out a curve and when I close it it become a character but the neat thing about it be I can add control point and then what I can do be manipulate they with both of my finger at the same time and you notice what it do it be kind of a puppeteering thing where I can use as many finger as I have to draw and make now there be a lot of actual math go on under here for this to control this mesh and do the right thing this technique of be able to manipulate a mesh here with multiple control point be actually state of the art it be release at SIGGRAPH last year it be a great example of the kind of research I really love all this compute power to make thing do the right thing intuitive thing to do exactly what you expect so multi touch interaction research be a very active field right now in HCI I be not the only one do it a lot of other person be get into it this kind of technology be go to let even more person get into it I be look forward to interact with all of you over the next few day and see how it can apply to you respective field thank you applause
