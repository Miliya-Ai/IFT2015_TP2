applause David Gallo this be Bill Lange I be Dave Gallo and we be go to tell you some story from the sea here in video we have get some of the most incredible video of Titanic that be ever be see and we be not go to show you any of it laughter the truth of the matter be that the Titanic even though it be break all sort of box office record it be not the most exciting story from the sea and the problem I think be that we take the ocean for grant when you think about it the ocean be 75 percent of the planet most of the planet be ocean water the average depth be about two mile part of the problem I think be we stand at the beach or we see image like this of the ocean and you look out at this great big blue expanse and it be shimmering and it be move and there be wave and there be surf and there be tide but you have no idea for what lie in there and in the ocean there be the long mountain range on the planet most of the animal be in the ocean most of the earthquake and volcano be in the sea at the bottom of the sea the biodiversity and the biodensity in the ocean be high in place than it be in the rainfor it be mostly unexplored and yet there be beautiful sight like this that captivate we and make we become familiar with it but when you be stand at the beach I want you to think that you be stand at the edge of a very unfamiliar world we have to have a very special technology to get into that unfamiliar world we use the submarine Alvin and we use camera and the camera be something that Bill Lange have develop with the help of Sony Marcel Proust say the true voyage of discovery be not so much in seek new landscape as in have new eye person that have partner with we have give we new eye not only on what exist the new landscape at the bottom of the sea but also how we think about life on the planet itself here be a jelly it be one of my favorite because it be get all sort of work part this turn out to be the long creature in the ocean it get up to about 150 foot long but see all that different work thing I love that kind of stuff it be get this fishing lure on the bottom they be go up and down it be get tentacle dangle swirl around like that it be a colonial animal this be all individual animal band together to make this one creature and it be get this jet thruster up in front that it will use in a moment and a little light if you take all the big fish and schooling fish and all that put they on one side of the scale put all the jelly type of animal on the other side that guy win hand down most of the biomass in the ocean be make out of creature like this here be the x wing death jelly laughter the bioluminescence they use the light for attract mate and attract prey and communicate we could not begin to show you we archival stuff from the jelly they come in all different size and shape Bill Lange we tend to forget about the fact that the ocean be mile deep on average and that we be real familiar with the animal that be in the first 200 or 300 foot but we be not familiar with what exist from there all the way down to the bottom and this be the type of animal that live in that three dimensional space that micro gravity environment that we really have not explore you hear about giant squid and thing like that but some of this animal get up to be approximately 140 160 foot long they be very little understood DG this be one of they another one of we favorite because it be a little octopod you can actually see through he head and here he be flap with he ear and very gracefully go up we see that at all depths and even at the great depths they go from a couple of inch to a couple of foot they come right up to the submarine they will put they eye right up to the window and peek inside the sub this be really a world within a world and we be go to show you two in this case we be pass down through the mid ocean and we see creature like this this be kind of like a undersea rooster this guy that look incredibly formal in a way and then one of my favorite what a face this be basically scientific datum that you be look at it be footage that we have collect for scientific purpose and that be one of the thing that Bill be be do be provide scientist with this first view of animal like this in the world where they belong they do not catch they in a net they be actually look at they down in that world we be go to take a joystick sit in front of we computer on the Earth and press the joystick forward and fly around the planet we be go to look at the mid ocean ridge a 40 000 mile long mountain range the average depth at the top of it be about a mile and a half and we be over the Atlantic that be the ridge right there but we be go to go across the Caribbean Central America and end up against the pacific nine degree north we make map of this mountain range with sound with sonar and this be one of that mountain range we be come around a cliff here on the right the height of this mountain on either side of this valley be great than the Alps in most case and there be ten of thousand of that mountain out there that have not be map yet this be a volcanic ridge we be get down further and further in scale and eventually we can come up with something like this this be a icon of we robot Jason it be call and you can sit in a room like this with a joystick and a headset and drive a robot like that around the bottom of the ocean in real time one of the thing we be try to do at Woods Hole with we partner be to bring this virtual world this world this unexplored region back to the laboratory because we see it in bit and piece right now we see it either as sound or we see it as video or we see it as photograph or we see it as chemical sensor but we never have yet put it all together into one interesting picture here be where Bill camera really do shine this be what be call a hydrothermal vent and what you be see here be a cloud of densely pack hydrogen sulfide rich water come out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor get up to 600 700 degree f somewhere in that range so that be all water under the sea a mile and a half two mile three mile down and we know it be volcanic back in the 60 70 and then we have some hint that this thing exist all along the axis of it because if you have get volcanism water be go to get down from the sea into crack in the sea floor come in contact with magma and come shoot out hot we be not really aware that it would be so rich with sulfide hydrogen sulfide we do not have any idea about this thing which we call chimney this be one of this hydrothermal vent six hundred degree f water come out of the Earth on either side of we be mountain range that be high than the Alps so the setting here be very dramatic BL the white material be a type of bacterium that thrive at 180 degree c DG I think that be one of the great story right now that we be see from the bottom of the sea be that the first thing we see come out of the sea floor after a volcanic eruption be bacterium and we start to wonder for a long time how do it all get down there what we find out now be that it be probably come from inside the Earth not only be it come out of the Earth so biogenesis make from volcanic activity but that bacterium support this colony of life the pressure here be 4 000 pound per square inch a mile and a half from the surface to two mile to three mile no sun have ever get down here all the energy to support this life form be come from inside the Earth so chemosynthesis and you can see how dense the population be this be call tube worm bl this worm have no digestive system they have no mouth but they have two type of gill structure one for extract oxygen out of the deep sea water another one which house this chemosynthetic bacterium which take the hydrothermal fluid that hot water that you see come out of the bottom and convert that into simple sugar that the tube worm can digest DG you can see here be a crab that live down there he be manage to grab a tip of this worm now they normally retract as soon as a crab touch they oh good go so as soon as a crab touch they they retract down into they shell just like you fingernail there be a whole story be play out here that we be just now begin to have some idea of because of this new camera technology bl this worm live in a real temperature extreme they foot be at about 200 degree c and they head be out at three degree c so it be like have you hand in boil water and you foot in freeze water that be how they like to live laughter DG this be a female of this kind of worm and here be a male you watch it do not take long before two guy here this one and one that will show up over here start to fight everything you see be play out in the pitch black of the deep sea there be never any light there except the light that we bring here they go on one of the last dive series we count 200 species in this area 198 be new new species bl one of the big problem be that for the biologist work at this site it be rather difficult to collect this animal and they disintegrate on the way up so the imagery be critical for the science DG two octopod at about two mile depth this pressure thing really amaze I that this animal can exist there at a depth with pressure enough to crush the Titanic like a empty Pepsi can what we see up till now be from the Pacific this be from the Atlantic even great depth you can see this shrimp be harass this poor little guy here and he will bat it away with he claw whack laughter and the same thing be go on over here what they be get at be that on the back of this crab the foodstuff here be this very strange bacterium that live on the back of all this animal and what this shrimp be try to do be actually harvest the bacterium from the back of this animal and the crab do not like it at all this long filament that you see on the back of the crab be actually create by the product of that bacterium so the bacterium grow hair on the crab on the back you see this again the red dot be the laser light of the submarine Alvin to give we a idea about how far away we be from the vent that be all shrimp you see the hot water over here here and here come out they be cling to a rock face and actually scrape bacterium off that rock face here be a tiny little vent that be come out of the side of that pillar that pillar get up to several story so here you have get this valley with this incredible alien landscape of pillar and hot spring and volcanic eruption and earthquake inhabit by this very strange animal that live only on chemical energy come out of the ground they do not need the sun at all BL you see this white v shape mark on the back of the shrimp it be actually a light sense organ it be how they find the hydrothermal vent the vent be emit a black body radiation a ir signature and so they be able to find this vent at considerable distance DG all this stuff be happen along that 40 000 mile long mountain range that we be call the ribbon of life because just even today as we speak there be life be generate there from volcanic activity this be the first time we have ever try this any place we be go to try to show you high definition from the Pacific we be move up one of this pillar this one several story tall in it you will see that it be a habitat for a lot of different animal there be a funny kind of hot plate here with vent water come out of it so all of this be individual home for worm now here be a close view of that community here be crab here worm here there be small animal crawl around here be pagoda structure I think this be the neat look thing I just can not get over this that you have get this little chimney sit here smoke away this stuff be toxic as hell by the way you could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean and it be come out all from it laughter it be unbelievable it be basically sulfuric acid and it be be just dump out at incredible rate and animal be thrive and we probably come from here that be probably where we evolve from BL this bacterium that we have be talk about turn out to be the most simplest form of life find there be a number of group that be propose that life evolve at this vent site although the vent site be short live a individual site may last only 10 year or so as a ecosystem they have be stable for million well billion of year DG it work too well you see there be some fish inside here as well there be a fish sit here here be a crab with he claw right at the end of that tube worm wait for that worm to stick he head out laughter bl the biologist right now can not explain why this animal be so active the worm be grow inch per week DG I already say that this site from a human perspective be toxic as hell not only that but on top the lifeblood that plumbing system turn off every year or so they plumbing system turn off so the site have to move and then there be earthquake and then volcanic eruption on the order of one every five year that completely wipe the area out despite that this animal grow back in about a year time you be talk about biodensity and biodiversity again high than the rainforest that just spring back to life be it sensitive yes be it fragile no it be not really very fragile I will end up with say one thing there be a story in the sea in the water of the sea in the sediment and the rock of the sea floor it be a incredible story what we see when we look back in time in that sediment and rock be a record of Earth history everything on this planet everything work by cycle and rhythm the continent move apart they come back together Oceans come and go mountain come and go glacier come and go El Nino come and go it be not a disaster it be rhythmic what we be learn now it be almost like a symphony it be just like music it really be just like music and what we be learn now be that you can not listen to a five billion year long symphony get to today and say stop we want tomorrow note to be the same as it be today it be absurd it be just absurd so what we have get to learn now be to find out where this planet be go at all this different scale and work with it learn to manage it the concept of preservation be futile conservation tough but we can probably get there thank you very much thank you applause
