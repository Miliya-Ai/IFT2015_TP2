I be Rich Baraniuk and what I would like to talk a little bit about today be some idea that I think have just tremendous resonance with all the thing that have be talk about the last two day so many different point of resonance that it be go to be difficult to bring they all up but I will try to do my good do anybody remember this laughter ok so this be lp record and they have be replace right they have be sweep away over the last two decade by this type of world flatten digitization technology right and I think it be good witness when Thomas be play the music as we come in the room today what be happen in the music world be there be a culture or a ecosystem that be be create that if you take some word from Apple the catchphrase that we create rip mix and burn what I mean by that be that anyone in the world be free and allow to create new music and musical idea anyone in the world be allow to rip or copy musical idea use they in innovative way anyone be allow to mix they in different type of way draw connection between musical idea and person can burn they or create final product and continue the circle and what that be do be it be create like I say a vibrant community that be very inclusive with person continually work to connect musical idea innovate they and keep thing constantly up to date today hit single be not last year hit single but I be not here to talk about music today I be here to talk about book in particular textbook and the kind of educational material that we use every day in school have anyone here ever be to school laughter ok do anybody realize there be a crisis in we school around the world I be not go to spend too much time on that but what I want to talk about be some of the disconnect that appear when a author publish a book that in fact the publishing process just because of the fact that it be complicate it be heavy book be expensive create a sort of a wall between author of book and the ultimate user of book be they teacher student or just general reader and this be even more true if you happen to speak a language other than one of the world major language and especially English I be go to call this person below the barrier shutout because they be really shut out of the process of be able to share they knowledge with the world and so what I want to talk about today be try to take this idea that we have see in the musical culture and try to bring this towards reinvent the way we think about write book use they and teach from they so that be what I would like to talk about and really how we get from where we be now to where we need to go the first thing I would like you to do be a little thought experiment imagine take all the world book ok everybody imagine book and imagine just tear out the page so liberate this page and imagine digitize they and then store they in a vast interconnect global repository think of it as a massive itune for book type content and then take that material and imagine make it all open so that person can modify it play with it improve it imagine make it free so that anyone in the world can have access to all of this knowledge and imagine use information technology so that you can update this content improve it play with it on a timescale that be more on the order of second instead of year instead of edition of a book come out every two year imagine they come out every 25 second so imagine we could do that and imagine we could put person into this so that we could truly build a ecosystem with not just author but all the person who could be or want to be author in all the different language of the world and I think if you could do this it would be call I be just go to refer to it as a knowledge ecosystem so really this be the dream and in a sense what you can think of it be we be try to enable anyone in the world I mean anyone in the world laughter to be they own educational dj create educational material share they with the world constantly innovate on they so this be the dream in fact this dream be actually be realize over the last six and a half year we have be work really hard at Rice University on a project call connexion and so what I would like to do for the rest of the talk be just tell you a little bit about what person be do with connexion which you can kind of think of as the counterpoint to Nicholas Negroponte talk yesterday where they be work on the hardware of bring education to the world we be work on the open source tool and the content so that be sort of to put it in perspective here so create what be some of the person that be use this kind of tool well the first thing be there be a community of engineering professor from Cambridge to Kyoto who be develop engineering content in electrical engineering to develop what you can think of as a massive super textbook that cover the entire area of electrical engineering and not only that it can be customize for use in each of they own individual institution if person like Kitty Jones a shut out a private music teacher and mom from Champagne Illinois who want to share she fantastic music content with the world on how to teach kid how to play music she material be now use over 600 000 time per month Tremendous use in fact a lot of this use come from United States K 12 school because anyone who be involve in a school scale back the first thing that be cut be the music curriculum and so this be just indicate the tremendous thirst for this kind of open free content a lot of teacher be use this stuff what about rip what about copy reuse a team of volunteer at the University of Texas at El Paso graduate student translate this engineering super textbook idea and within about a week have this be some of we most popular material in widespread use all over Latin America and in particular in Mexico because of the open extensible nature of this person volunteer and even company that be translate material into Asian language like Chinese Japanese and Thai to spread the knowledge even far ok what about person who be mix what do mix mean mix mean build customize course mean build customize book company like National Instruments who be embed very powerful interactive simulation into the material so that we can go way beyond we regular kind of textbook to a experience that all the teaching material be thing you can actually interact with and play around with and actually learn as you do we have be work with Teachers without Borders who be very interested in mix we material they be go to be use connexion as they platform to develop and deliver teaching material for teach teacher how to teach in 84 country around the world twb be currently in Iraq train 20 000 teacher support by USAID and to they this idea of be able to remix and customize to the local context be extraordinarily important because just provide free content to person have actually be liken by person in the develop world to a kind of cultural imperialism that if you do not empower person with the ability to be contextualize the material translate it into they own language and take ownership of it it be not good ok other organization we have be work with UC Merced person know about UC merce it be a new university in California in the Central Valley work very closely with community college they be actually develop a lot of they science and engineering curriculum to spread widely around the world in we system and they be also try to develop all of they software tool completely open source we have be work with AMD which have a project call 50x15 which be try to bring internet connectivity to 50 percent of the world population by 2015 we be go to be provide content to they in a whole range of different language and we have also be work with a number of other organization in particular a bunch of the project that be fund by Hewlett Foundation who have take a real leadership role in this area of open content ok burn I think this be sort of quite interesting burn be the idea of try to create the physical instantiation of one of this course and I think a lot of you receive I think all of you receive one of this music book in you gift pack a little present for you just to tell you quickly about it this be a engineering textbook it be about 300 page long hardbound this cost anybody guess how much would it cost in a bookstore audience 65 dollar Richard Baraniuk ok this cost 22 dollar to the student why do it cost 22 dollar because it be publish on demand and it be develop from this repository of open material if this book be to be publish by a regular publisher it would cost at least 122 dollar so what we be see be move this burning or publication process from the regular sort of single author book towards community author material that be modular that be customize to each individual class and publish on demand very inexpensively either push out through Amazon or publish directly through a on demand press like QOOP and I think that this be a extraordinarily interesting area because there be tremendous area under this long tail in publishing we be not talk about the Harry Potter end right at the left side we be talk about book on hypergeometric partial differential equation book that might sell 100 copy a year 1 000 copy a year there be tremendous sustaining revenue under this long tail to sustain open project like ours but also to sustain this new emergence of on demand publisher like QOOP who produce this two book and I think one of the thing that you should take away from this talk be that there be a impending cut out the middle man disintermediation that be go to be happen in the publishing industry and it be go to reach a crescendo over the next few year and I think that it be for we benefit really and for the world benefit ok so what be the enabler what be really make all of this happen there be ton of technology and the only piece of technology that I really want to talk about be xml how many person know about xml oh great so it be the future of the web right it be semantic representation of content and what you can really think of xml in this case be it be the packaging that we be put around this page remember we take the book tear the page out well what the xml be go to do be it be go to turn that page into Lego block xml be the nub on the Lego that allow we to combine the content together in a myriad different way and it provide we a framework to share content so it let you take this ecosystem in its primordial state of all this content all the page you have tear out of book and create highly sophisticated learning machine book course course pack it give you the ability to personalize the learning experience to each individual student so that every student can have a book or a course that be customize to they learn style they context they language and the thing that excite they it let you reuse the same material in multiple different way and surprising new way it let you interconnect idea indicate how field relate to each other and I will just give you my personal story we come up with this six and a half year ago because I teach the stuff in the red box and my day job as Chris say I be a electrical engineering professor I teach signal processing and my challenge be to show that this math wow about half of you have already fall asleep just look at the equation laughter but this seemingly dry math be actually the center of this tremendously powerful web that link technology that link really cool application like music synthesizer to tremendous economic opportunity but also govern by intellectual property and the thing that I realize be there be no way that I as a engineer could write this book that would get all of this across we need a community to do it and we need new tool to be able to interconnect this idea and I think that really in a sense what we be try to do be make Minsky dream come to a reality where you can imagine all the book in a library actually start to talk to each other and person who be teacher out here whoever teach you know this it be the interconnection between idea that teaching be really all about ok back to math imagine this be possible that every single equation that you click on in one of you new e text be something that you be go to be able to explore and experiment with so imagine you kid algebra textbook in seventh grade you can click on every single equation and bring up a little tool to be able to experiment with it tinker with it understand it because we really do not understand until we do the same type of mark up like MathML for chemistry imagine chemistry textbook that actually understand the structure of how molecule be form imagine music xml that actually let you delve into the semantic structure of music play with it understand it it be no wonder that everybody get into it right even the three wise man laughter ok the second big enabler and this be where I tell a big lie the second big enabler be intellectual property because in fact I get up here and I talk about how great the music culture be we can share and rip mix and burn but in fact that be all illegal and we would be accuse of piracy for do that because this music have be propertize it be now own much of it by big industry so really the key thing here be we can not let this happen we can not let this Napster thing happen here so what we have to do be get it right from the very beginning and what we have to do be find a intellectual property framework that make sharing safe and make it easily understandable and the inspiration here be take from open source software thing like Linux and the GPL the Creative Commons license how many person have hear of creative common if you have not you must learn about it Creativecommons org at the bottom of every piece of material in Connexions and in lot of other project you can find they logo click on that logo take you to a absolute no nonsense human readable document a deed that tell you exactly what you can do with this content in fact you be free to share it to do all of this thing to copy it to change it even to make commercial use of it as long as you attribute the author because in academic publishing and much of educational publishing it be really this idea of share knowledge and make impact that be why person write not necessarily make buck we be not talk about Harry Potter right we be at the long tail end here behind that be the legal code very carefully construct and Creative Commons be take off over 43 million thing out there license with a creative Commons license not just text but music image video and there be actually a tremendous uptake of the number of person that be actually license music to make it free for person who do this whole idea of re sampling rip mix burn and share ok I would like to conclude with just the last few point so we have build this idea of a common person be use it we get over 500 000 unique visitor per month just to we particular site MIT OpenCourseWare which be another large open content site get a similar number of hit but how do we protect this how do we protect it into the future and the first thing that person be probably think be quality control right because we be say that anybody can contribute thing to this common anybody can contribute anything so that could be a problem it do not take long until person start contribute material for example on lingerie which be actually a pretty good module the only problem be it be plagiarize from a major French feminist journal and when you go to the suppose course website it point to a lingerie sell website so this be a little bit of a problem so we clearly need some kind of idea of quality control and this be really where the idea of review and peer review come in you come to TED why do you come to TED because Chris and he team have ensure that thing be very very high quality right and so we need to be able to do the same thing and we need to be able to design structure and what we be do be design social software to enable anyone to build they own peer review process and we call this thing lens and basically what they allow be anyone out there can develop they own peer review process so that they can focus on the content in the repository that they think be really important and you can think of TED as a potential lens so I would just like to end by say you can really view this as a call to action connexion and open content be all about share knowledge all of you here be tremendously imbue with tremendous amount of knowledge and what I would like to do be invite each and every one of you to contribute to this project and other project of its type because I think together we can truly change the landscape of education and educational publishing so thanks very much
