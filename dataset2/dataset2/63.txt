I have all my life wonder what mind boggle mean after two day here I declare myself boggled and enormously impressed and feel that you be one of the great hope not just for American achievement in science and technology but for the whole world I have come however on a special mission on behalf of my constituency which be the 10 to the 18th power that be a million trillion insect and other small creature and to make a plea for they if we be to wipe out insect alone just that group alone on this planet which we be try hard to do the rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappear from the land and within a few month now how do I come to this particular position of advocacy as a little boy and through my teenage year I become increasingly fascinate by the diversity of life I have a butterfly period a snake period a bird period a fish period a cave period and finally and definitively a ant period by my college year I be a devoted myrmecologist a specialist on the biology of ant but my attention and research continue to make journey across the great variety of life on Earth in general include all that it mean to we as a species how little we understand it and how press a danger that we activity have create for it out of that broad study have emerge a concern and a ambition crystallize in the wish that I be about to make to you my choice be the culmination of a lifetime commitment that begin with grow up on the Gulf Coast of Alabama on the Florida peninsula as far back as I can remember I be enchant by the natural beauty of that region and the almost tropical exuberance of the plant and animal that grow there one day when I be only seven year old and fishing I pull a pinfish they be call with sharp dorsal spine up too hard and fast and I blind myself in one eye I later discover I be also hard of hear possibly congenitally in the upper register so in planning to be a professional naturalist I never consider anything else in my entire life I find that I be lousy at bird watch and could not track frog call either so I turn to the teem small creature that can be hold between the thumb and forefinger the little thing that compose the foundation of we ecosystem the little thing as I like to say who run the world in so do I reach a frontier of biology so strange so rich that it seem as though it exist on another planet in fact we live on a mostly unexplored planet the great majority of organism on Earth remain unknown to science in the last 30 year thanks to exploration in remote part of the world and advance in technology biologist have for example add a full one third of the know frog and other amphibian species to bring the current total to 5 400 and more continue to pour in two new kind of whale have be discover along with two new antelope dozen of monkey species and a new kind of elephant and even a distinct kind of gorilla at the extreme opposite end of the size scale the class of marine bacterium the Prochlorococci that will be on the final exam although discover only in 1988 be now recognize as likely the most abundant organism on Earth and moreover responsible for a large part of the photosynthesis that occur in the ocean this bacterium be not uncover soon because they be also among the small of all Earth organism so minute that they can not be see with conventional optical microscopy yet life in the sea may depend on this tiny creature this example be just the first glimpse of we ignorance of life on this planet consider the fungus include mushroom rust mold and many disease cause organism 60 000 species be know to science but more than 1 5 million have be estimate to exist consider the nematode roundworm the most abundant of all animal four out of five animal on Earth be nematode worm if all solid material except nematode worm be to be eliminate you could still see the ghostly outline of most of it in nematode worm about 16 000 species of nematode worm have be discover and diagnose by scientist there could be hundred of thousand of they even million still unknown this vast domain of hidden biodiversity be increase still further by the dark matter of the biological world of bacterium which within just the last several year still be know from only about 6 000 species of bacterium worldwide but that number of bacterium species can be find in one gram of soil just a little handful of soil in the 10 billion bacterium that would be there it be be estimate that a single ton of soil fertile soil contain approximately four million species of bacterium all unknown so the question be what be they all do the fact be we do not know we be live on a planet with a lot of activity with reference to we live environment do by faith and guess alone we life depend upon this creature to take a example close to home there be over 500 species of bacterium now know friendly bacterium live symbiotically in you mouth and throat probably necessary to you health for hold off pathogenic bacterium at this point I think we have a little impressionistic film that be make especially for this occasion and I would like to show it assist in this by Billie Holiday Video and that may be just the begin the virus that quasi organism among which be the prophage the gene weaver that promote the continue evolution in the life of the bacterium be a virtually unknown frontier of modern biology a world unto themselves what constitute a viral species be still unresolved although they be obviously of enormous importance to we but this much we can say the variety of gene on the planet in virus exceed or be likely to exceed that in all of the rest of life combine nowadays in address microbial biodiversity scientist be like explorer in a rowboat launch onto the Pacific Ocean but that be change rapidly with the aid of new genomic technology already it be possible to sequence the entire genetic code of a bacterium in under four hour soon we will be in a position to go forth in the field with sequencer on we back to hunt bacterium in tiny crevice of the habitat surface in the way you go watch for bird with binoculars what will we find as we map the living world as finally we get this underway seriously as we move past the relatively gigantic mammal bird frog and plant to the more elusive insect and other small invertebrate and then beyond to the countless million of organism in the invisible living world envelop and live within humanity already what be think to be bacterium for generation have be find to compose instead two great domain of microorganism true bacterium and one cell organism the archaea which be close than other bacterium to the eukaryota the group that we belong to some serious biologist and I count myself among they have begin to wonder that among the enormous and still unknown diversity of microorganism one might just might find alien among they true alien stock that arrive from outer space they have have billion of year to do it but especially during the early period of biological evolution on this planet we do know that some bacterial species that have earthly origin be capable of almost unimaginable extreme of temperature and other harsh change in environment include hard radiation strong enough and maintain long enough to crack the pyrex vessel around the grow population of bacterium there may be a temptation to treat the biosphere holistically and the species that compose it as a great flux of entity hardly worth distinguish one from the other but each of this species even the tiny Prochlorococci be masterpiece of evolution each have persist for thousand to million of year each be exquisitely adapt to the environment in which it live interlock with other species to form ecosystem upon which we own life depend in way we have not begin even to imagine we will destroy this ecosystem and the species compose they at the peril of we own existence and unfortunately we be destroy they with ingenuity and ceaseless energy my own epiphany as a conservationist come in 1953 while a Harvard graduate student search for rare ant find in the mountain forest of Cuba ant that shine in the sunlight metallic green or metallic blue accord to species and one species I discover metallic gold I find my magical ant but only after a tough climb into the mountain where the last of the native Cuban forest hang on and be then and still be be cut back I realize then that this species and a large part of the other unique marvelous animal and plant on that island and this be true of practically every part of the world which take million of year to evolve be in the process of disappear forever and so it be everywhere one look the human juggernaut be permanently erode Earth ancient biosphere by a combination of force that can be summarize by the acronym HIPPO the animal hippo h be for habitat destruction include climate change force by greenhouse gas i be for the invasive species like the fire ant the zebra mussel broom grass and pathogenic bacterium and virus that be flood every country and at a exponential rate that be the i the p the first one in hippo be for pollution the second be for continued population human population expansion and the final letter be o for over harvesting drive species into extinction by excessive hunting and fish the HIPPO juggernaut we have create if unabated be destine accord to the good estimate of ongoing biodiversity research to reduce half of Earth still survive animal and plant species to extinction or critical endangerment by the end of the century human force climate change alone again if unabated could eliminate a quarter of survive species during the next five decade what will we and all future generation lose if much of the living environment be thus degrade huge potential source of scientific information yet to be gather much of we environmental stability and new kind of pharmaceutical and new product of unimaginable strength and value all throw away the loss will inflict a heavy price in wealth security and yes spirituality for all time to come because previous cataclysm of this kind the last one that end the age of dinosaur take normally five to 10 million year to repair sadly we knowledge of biodiversity be so incomplete that we be at risk of lose a great deal of it before it be even discover for example even in the United States the 200 000 species know currently actually have be find to be only partial in coverage it be mostly unknown to we in basic biology only about 15 percent of the know species have be study well enough to evaluate they status of the 15 percent evaluate 20 percent be classify as in peril that be in danger of extinction that be in the United States we be in short fly blind into we environmental future we urgently need to change this we need to have the biosphere properly explore so that we can understand and competently manage it we need to settle down before we wreck the planet and we need that knowledge this should be a big science project equivalent to the Human Genome Project it should be think of as a biological moonshot with a timetable so this bring I to my wish for tedster and to anyone else around the world who hear this talk I wish we will work together to help create the key tool that we need to inspire preservation of Earth biodiversity and let we call it the Encyclopedia of Life what be the Encyclopedia of Life A concept that have already take hold and be begin to spread and be look at seriously it be a encyclopedia that live on the internet and be contribute to by thousand of scientist around the world Amateurs can do it also it have a indefinitely expandable page for each species it make all key information about life on Earth accessible to anyone on demand anywhere in the world I have write about this idea before and I know there be person in this room who have expend significant effort on it in the past but what excite I be that since I first put forward this particular idea in that form science have advance technology have move forward today the practicality of make such a encyclopedia regardless of the magnitude of the information put into it be within reach indeed in the past year a group of influential scientific institution have begin mobilize to realize this dream I wish you would help they work together we can make this real the encyclopedia will quickly pay for itself in practical application it will address transcendent quality in the human consciousness and sense of human need it will transform the science of biology in way of obvious benefit to humanity and most of all it can inspire a new generation of biologist to continue the quest that start for I personally 60 year ago to search for life to understand it and finally above all to preserve it that be my wish thank you
