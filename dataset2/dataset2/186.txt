I be here to enlist you in help reshape the story about how human and other critter get thing do here be the old story we have already hear a little bit about it biology be war in which only the fierce survive business and nation succeed only by defeat destroy and dominate competition politics be about you side win at all cost but I think we can see the very beginning of a new story begin to emerge it be a narrative spread across a number of different discipline in which cooperation collective action and complex interdependency play a more important role and the central but not all important role of competition and survival of the fit shrink just a little bit to make room I start think about the relationship between communication media and collective action when I write Smart Mobs and I find that when I finish the book I keep think about it in fact if you look back human communication media and the way in which we organize socially have be co evolve for quite a long time human have live for much much long than the approximately 10 000 year of settle agricultural civilizationin small family group nomadic hunter bring down rabbit gather food the form of wealth in that day be enough food to stay alive but at some point they band together to hunt big game and we do not know exactly how they do this although they must have solve some collective action problem it only make sense that you can not hunt mastodon while you be fight with the other group and again we have no way of know but it be clear that a new form of wealth must have emerge more protein than a hunter family could eat before it rot so that raise a social question that I believe must have drive new social form do the person who eat that mastodon meat owe something to the hunter and they family and if so how do they make arrangement again we can not know but we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have be involve of course with agriculture come the first big civilization the first city build of mud and brick the first empire and it be the administer of this empire who begin hire person to keep track of the wheat and sheep and wine that be owe and the tax that be owe on they by make mark mark on clay in that time not too much long after that the alphabet be invent and this powerful tool be really reserve for thousand of year for the elite administrator laughter who keep track of account for the empire and then another communication technology enable new media the printing press come along and within decade million of person become literate and from literate population new form of collective action emerge in the sphere of knowledge religion and politics we see scientific revolution the Protestant Reformation constitutional democracy possible where they have not be possible before not create by the printing press but enable by the collective action that emerge from literacy and again new form of wealth emerge now commerce be ancient market be as old as the crossroads but capitalism as we know it be only a few hundred year old enable by cooperative arrangement and technology such as the joint stock ownership company share liability insurance double entry bookkeeping now of course the enable technology be base on the internet and in the many to many era every desktop be now a printing press a broadcasting station a community or a marketplace evolution be speed up more recently that power be untether and leap off the desktop and very very quickly we be go to see a significant proportion if not the majority of the human race walk around hold carry or wear supercomputer link at speed great than what we consider to be broadband today now when I start look into collective action the considerable literature on it be base on what sociologist call social dilemma and there be a couple of mythic narrative of social dilemma I be go to talk briefly about two of they the prisoner dilemma and the tragedy of the common now when I talk about this with Kevin Kelly he assure I that everybody in this audience pretty much know the detail of the prisoner dilemma so I be just go to go over that very very quickly if you have more question about it ask Kevin Kelly later laughter the prisoner dilemma be actually a story that be overlay on a mathematical matrix that come out of the game theory in the early year of think about nuclear war two player who could not trust each other let I just say that every unsecured transaction be a good example of a prisoner dilemma person with the goods person with the money because they can not trust each other be not go to exchange neither one want to be the first one or they be go to get the sucker payoff but both lose of course because they do not get what they want if they could only agree if they could only turn a prisoner dilemma into a different payoff matrix call a assurance game they could proceed twenty year ago Robert Axelrod use the prisoner dilemma as a probe of the biological question if we be here because we ancestor be such fierce competitor how do cooperation exist at all he start a computer tournament for person to submit prisoner dilemma strategy and discover much to he surprise that a very very simple strategy win it win the first tournament and even after everyone know it win it win the second tournament that be know as tit for tat another economic game that may not be as well know as the prisoner dilemma be the ultimatum game and it be also a very interesting probe of we assumption about the way person make economic transaction here be how the game be play there be two player they have never play the game before they will not play the game again they do not know each other and they be in fact in separate room first player be offer a hundred dollar and be ask to propose a split 50 50 90 10 whatever that player want to propose the second player either accept the split both player be pay and the game be over or reject the split neither player be pay and the game be over now the fundamental basis of neoclassical economics would tell you it be irrational to reject a dollar because someone you do not know in another room be go to get 99 yet in thousand of trial with American and European and Japanese student a significant percentage would reject any offer that be not close to 50 50 and although they be screen and do not know about the game and have never play the game before proposer seem to innately know this because the average proposal be surprisingly close to 50 50 now the interesting part come in more recently when anthropologist begin take this game to other culture and discover to they surprise that slash and burn agriculturalist in the Amazon or nomadic pastoralist in Central Asia or a dozen different culture each have radically different idea of what be fair which suggest that instead of there be a innate sense of fairness that somehow the basis of we economic transaction can be influence by we social institution whether we know that or not the other major narrative of social dilemma be the tragedy of the common Garrett Hardin use it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960 he use the example of a common grazing area in which each person by simply maximize they own flock lead to overgrazing and the depletion of the resource he have the rather gloomy conclusion that human will inevitably despoil any common pool resource in which person can not be restrain from use it now Elinor Ostrom a political scientist in 1990 ask the interesting question that any good scientist should ask which be be it really true that human will always despoil common so she go out and look at what datum she could find she look at thousand of case of human share watershed forestry resource fishery and discover that yes in case after case human destroy the common that they depend on but she also find many instance in which person escape the prisoner dilemma in fact the tragedy of the common be a multiplayer prisoner dilemma and she say that person be only prisoner if they consider themselves to be they escape by create institution for collective action and she discover I think most interestingly that among that institution that work there be a number of common design principle and that principle seem to be miss from that institution that do not work I be move very quickly over a number of discipline in biology the notion of symbiosis group selection evolutionary psychology be contest to be sure but there be really no long any major debate over the fact that cooperative arrangement have move from a peripheral role to a central role in biology from the level of the cell to the level of the ecology and again we notion of individual as economic being have be overturn rational self interest be not always the dominate factor in fact person will act to punish cheater even at a cost to themselves and most recently neurophysiological measure have show that person who punish cheater in economic game show activity in the reward center of they brain which lead one scientist to declare that altruistic punishment may be the glue that hold society together now I have be talk about how new form of communication and new media in the past have help create new economic form Commerce be ancient market be very old capitalism be fairly recent socialism emerge as a reaction to that and yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emerge Jim Surowiecki briefly mention Yochai Benkler paper about open source point to a new form of production peer to peer production I simply want you to keep in mind that if in the past new form of cooperation enable by new technology create new form of wealth we may be move into yet another economic form that be significantly different from previous one very briefly let look at some business IBM as you know HP Sun some of the most fierce competitor in the it world be open source they software be provide portfolio of patent for the common Eli Lilly in again the fiercely competitive pharmaceutical world have create a market for solution for pharmaceutical problem Toyota instead of treat its supplier as a marketplace treat they as a network and train they to produce good even though they be also train they to produce good for they competitor now none of this company be do this out of altruism they be do it because they be learn that a certain kind of sharing be in they self interest open source production have show we that world class software like Linux and Mozilla can be create with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm nor the incentive of the marketplace as we have know they Google enrich itself by enrich thousand of blogger through AdSense Amazon have open its application Programming Interface to 60 000 developer countless Amazon shop they be enrich other not out of altruism but as a way of enrich themselves eBay solve the prisoner dilemma and create a market where none would have exist by create a feedback mechanism that turn a prisoner dilemma game into a assurance game instead of neither of we can trust each other so we have to make suboptimal move it be you prove to I that you be trustworthy and I will cooperate Wikipedia have use thousand of volunteer to create a free encyclopedia with a million and a half article in 200 language in just a couple of year we have see that ThinkCycle have enable NGOs in develop country to put up problem to be solve by design student around the world include something that be be use for tsunami relief right now it be a mechanism for rehydrate cholera victim that be so simple to use it illiterate can be train to use it BitTorrent turn every downloader into a uploader make the system more efficient the more it be use million of person have contribute they desktop computer when they be not use they to link together through the internet into supercomputing collective that help solve the protein folding problem for medical researcher that be fold home at Stanford to crack code to search for life in outer space I do not think we know enough yet I do not think we have even begin to discover what the basic principle be but I think we can begin to think about they and I do not have enough time to talk about all of they but think about self interest this be all about self interest that add up to more in El Salvador both side that withdraw from they civil war take move that have be prove to mirror a prisoner dilemma strategy in the U S in the Philippines in Kenya around the world citizen have self organize political protest and get out the vote campaign use mobile device and sm be a Apollo Project of cooperation possible a transdisciplinary study of cooperation I believe that the payoff would be very big I think we need to begin develop map of this territory so that we can talk about it across discipline and I be not say that understand cooperation be go to cause we to be good person and sometimes person cooperate to do bad thing but I will remind you that a few hundred year ago person see they love one die from disease they think be cause by sin or foreigner or evil spirit descarte say we need a entire new way of think when the scientific method provide that new way of thinking and biology show that microorganism cause disease suffering be alleviate what form of suffering could be alleviate what form of wealth could be create if we know a little bit more about cooperation I do not think that this transdisciplinary discourse be automatically go to happen it be go to require effort so I enlist you to help I get the cooperation project start thank you applause
