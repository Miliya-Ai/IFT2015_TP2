I bet you be worried laughter I be worried that be why I begin this piece I be worried about vagina I be worried what we think about vagina and even more worried that we do not think about they I be worried about my own vagina it need a context a culture a community of other vagina there be so much darkness and secrecy surround they like the Bermuda Triangle nobody ever report back from there laughter in the first place it be not so easy to even find you vagina woman go day week month without look at it I interview a high power businesswoman she tell I she do not have time look at you vagina she say be a full day work laughter you have get to get down there on you back in front of a mirror full length prefer you have get to get in the perfect position with the perfect light which then become shadow by the angle you be at you be twist you head up arch you back it be exhausting she be busy she do not have time so I decide to talk to woman about they vagina they begin as casual vagina interview and they turn into vagina monologue I talk with over 200 woman I talk to old woman young woman marry woman lesbian single woman I talk to corporate professional college professor actor sex worker I talk to African American woman Asian American woman native American woman Caucasian woman Jewish woman ok at first woman be a little shy a little reluctant to talk once they get go you could not stop they woman love to talk about they vagina they do mainly because no one ever ask they before laughter let just start with the word vagina vagina vagina it sound like a infection at good maybe a medical instrument hurry nurse bring the vagina laughter vagina vagina vagina it do not matter how many time you say the word it never sound like a word you want to say it be a completely ridiculous totally un sexy word if you use it during sex try to be politically correct Darling would you stroke my vagina you kill the act right there laughter I be worried what we call they and do

Nishi Dignity Coochi Snorcher Cooter Labbe Gladys Seagelman VA Wee wee Horsespot Nappy Dugout Mongo Ghoulie Powderbox a Mimi in Miami a Split Knish in Philadelphia laughter and a Schmende in the Bronx laughter I be worried about vagina this be how the Vagina Monologues begin but it really do not begin there it begin with a conversation with a woman we be have a conversation about menopause and we get onto the subject of she vagina which you will do if you be talk about menopause and she say thing that really shock I about she vagina that it be dry up and finish and dead and I be kind of shocked so I say to a friend casually well what do you think about you vagina and that woman say something more amazing and then the next woman say something more amazing and before I know it every woman be tell I I have to talk to somebody about they vagina because they have a amazing story and I be suck down the vagina trail laughter and I really have not get off of it I think if you have tell I when I be young that I be go to grow up and be in shoe store and person would scream out there she be the Vagina Lady I do not know that that would have be my life ambition laughter but I want to talk a little bit about happiness and the relationship to this whole vagina journey because it have be a extraordinary journey that begin eight year ago I think before I do the Vagina Monologues I do not really believe in happiness I think that only idiot be happy to be honest I remember when I start practice Buddhism 14 year ago and I be tell that the end of this practice be to be happy I say how could you be happy and live in this world of suffering and live in this world of pain I mistake happiness for a lot of other thing like numbness or decadence or selfishness and what happen through the course of the Vagina Monologues and this journey be I think I have come to understand a little bit more about happiness there be three quality I want to talk about one be see what be right in front of you and talk about it and state it I think what I learn from talk about the vagina and speak about the vagina be it be the most obvious thing it be right in the center of my body and the center of the world and yet it be the one thing nobody talk about the second thing be that what talk about the vagina do be it open this door which allow I to see that there be a way to serve the world to make it good and that be where the deep happiness have actually come from and the third principle of happiness which I have realize recently eight year ago this momentum and this energy this v wave start and I can only describe it as a v wave because to be honest I really do not understand it completely I feel at the service of it but this wave start and if I question the wave or try to stop the wave or look back at the wave I often have the experience of whiplash or the potential of my neck break but if I go with the wave and I trust the wave and I move with the wave I go to the next place and it happen logically and organically and truthfully and I start this piece particularly with story and narrative and I be talk to one woman and that lead to another woman and that lead to another woman and then I write that story down and I put they out in front of other person and every single time I do the show at the begin woman would literally line up after the show because they want to tell I they story and at first I think oh great I will hear about wonderful orgasm and great sex life and how woman love they vagina but in fact that be not what woman line up to tell I what woman line up to tell I be how they be rape and how they be batter and how they be beat and how they be gang rape in parking lot and how they be incest by they uncle and I want to stop do the Vagina Monologues because it feel too daunting I feel like a war photographer who take picture of terrible event but do not intervene on they behalf and so in 1997 I say let get woman together what could we do with this information that all this woman be be violate and it turn out after think and investigate that I discover and the UN have actually say this recently that one out of every three woman on this planet will be beat or rape in she lifetime that be essentially a gender that be essentially the resource of the planet which be woman so in 1997 we get all this incredible woman together and we say how can we use the play this energy to stop violence against woman and we put on one event in New York City in the theater and all this great actor come from Susan Sarandon to Glenn Close to Whoopi Goldberg and we do one performance on one evening and that catalyze this wave this energy and within five year this extraordinary thing begin to happen one woman take that energy and she say I want to bring this wave this energy to college campus and so she take the play and she say let use the play and have performance once a year where we can raise money to stop violence against woman in local community all around the world and in one year it go to 50 college and then it expand and over the course of the last six year it be spread and it be spread and it be spread around the world what I have learn be two thing one that the epidemic of violence towards woman be shocking it be global it be so profound and it be so devastating and it be so in every little pocket of every little crater of every little society that we do not even recognize it because it be become ordinary this journey have take I to Afghanistan where I have the extraordinary honor and privilege to go into part of Afghanistan under the Taliban I be dress in a burqa and I go in with a extraordinary group call the Revolutionary Association of the woman of Afghanistan and I see firsthand how woman have be strip of every single right that be possible to strip woman of from be educate to be employ to be actually allow to eat ice cream for that of you who do not know it be illegal to eat ice cream under the Taliban and I actually see and meet woman who have be flog for be catch eat vanilla ice cream I be take to the secret ice cream eat place in a little town where we go to a back room and woman be seat and a curtain be pull around we and they be serve vanilla ice cream and woman lift they burqa and eat this ice cream and I do not think I ever understand pleasure until that moment and how woman have find a way to keep they pleasure alive it have take I this journey to Islamabad where I have witness and meet woman with they face melt off it have take I to Juarez Mexico where I be a week ago where I have literally be there in parking lot where bone of woman have wash up and be dump next to Coca Cola bottle it have take I to university all over this country where girl be date rape and drug I have see terrible terrible terrible violence but I have also recognize in the course of see that violence that be in the face of thing and see actually what be in front of we be the antidote to depression and to a feeling that one be worthless and have no value because before the Vagina Monologues I will say that 80 percent of my consciousness be close off to what be really go on in this reality and that close off close off my vitality and my life energy what have also happen be in the course of this travels and it be be a extraordinary thing be that every single place that I have go to in the world I have meet a new species and I really love hear about all this species at the bottom of the sea and I be think about how be with this extraordinary person on this particular panel that it be beneath beyond and between and the vagina kind of fit into all that category laughter but one of the thing I have see be this species and it be a species and it be a new paradigm and it do not get report in the press or in the media because I do not think good news ever be news and I do not think person who be transform the planet be what get the rating on tv show but every single country I have be to and in the last six year I have be to about 45 country and many tiny little village and city and town I have see something what I have come to call vagina warrior a vagina warrior be a woman or a vagina friendly man who have witness incredible violence or suffer it and rather than get a AK 47 or a weapon of mass destruction or a machete they hold the violence in they body they grieve it they experience it and then they go out and devote they life to make sure it do not happen to anybody else I have meet this woman everywhere on the planet and I want to tell a few story because I believe that story be the way that we transmit information where it go into we body and I think one of the thing about be at TED that be be very interesting be that I live in my body a lot and I do not live in my head very much anymore and this be a very heady place and it be be really interesting to be in my head for the last two day I have be very disoriented laughter because I think the world the v world be very much in you body it be a body world and the species really exist in the body and I think there be a real significance in we attach we body to we head that that separation have create a divide that be often separate purpose from intent and the connection between body and head often bring that thing into union I want to talk about three particular person that I have meet vagina warrior who really transform my understanding of this whole principle and species and one be a woman name Marsha Lopez Marsha Lopez be a woman I meet in Guatemala she be 14 year old and she be in a marriage and she husband be beat she on a regular basis and she could not get out because she be addict to the relationship and she have no money she sister be young than she and she apply we have a stop rape contest a few year ago in New York and she apply hope that she would become a finalist and she could bring she sister she do become a finalist she bring Marsha to New York and at that time we do this extraordinary v day at Madison Square Garden where we sell out the entire testosterone fill dome 18 000 person stand up to say yes to vagina which be really a pretty incredible transformation and she come and she witness this and she decide that she would go back and leave she husband and that she would bring V Day to Guatemala she be 21 year old I go to Guatemala and she have sell out the National Theater of Guatemala and I watch she walk up on stage in she red short dress and high heel and she stand there and say my name be Marsha I be beat by my husband for five year he almost murder I I leave and you can too and the entire 2 000 person go absolutely crazy there be a woman name Esther Ch vez who I meet in Juarez Mexico and Esther Ch vez be a brilliant accountant in Mexico City she be 72 year old and she be plan to retire she go to Juarez to take care of a ail aunt and in the course of it she begin to discover what be happen to the murder and disappear woman of Juarez she give up she life she move to Juarez she start to write the story which document the disappeared woman 300 woman have disappear in a border town because they be brown and poor there have be no response to the disappearance and not one person have be hold accountable she begin to document it she open a center call Casa Amiga and in six year she have literally bring this to the consciousness of the world we be there a week ago when there be 7 000 person in the street and it be truly a miracle and as we walk through the street the person of Juarez who normally do not even come into the street because the street be so dangerous literally stand there and weep to see that other person from the world have show up for that particular community there be another woman name Agnes and Agnes for I epitomize what a vagina warrior be I meet she three year ago in Kenya and Agnes be mutilate as a little girl she be circumcise against she will when she be 10 year old and she really make a decision that she do not want this practice to continue anymore in she community so when she get old she create this incredible thing it be a anatomical sculpture of a woman body half a woman body and she walk through the Rift Valley and she have vagina and vagina replacement part where she would teach girl and parent and boy and girl what a healthy vagina look like and what a mutilate vagina look like and in the course of she travel she walk literally for eight year through the Rift Valley through dust through sleep on the ground because the Maasai be nomad and she would have to find they and they would move and she would find they again she save 1 500 girl from be cut and in that time she create a alternative ritual which involve girl come of age without the cut when we meet she three year ago we say what could V Day do for you and she say well if you get I a jeep I could get around a lot fast laughter so we buy she a jeep and in the year that she have the jeep she save 4 500 girl from be cut so we say to she what else could we do for you she say well Eve if you give I some money I could open a house and girl could run away and they could be save and I want to tell this little story about my own beginning because it be very interrelated to happiness and Agnes when I be a little girl I grow up in a wealthy community it be a upper middle class white community and it have all the trappings and the look of a perfectly nice wonderful great life and everyone be suppose to be happy in that community and in fact my life be hell I live with a alcoholic father who beat I and molest I and it be all inside that and always as a child I have this fantasy that somebody would come and rescue I and I actually make up a little character whose name be Mr Alligator I would call he up when thing get really bad and say it be time to come and pick I up and I would pack a little bag and wait for Mr Alligator to come now Mr Alligator never do come but the idea of Mr Alligator come actually save my sanity and make it ok for I to keep go because I believe in the distance there would be someone come to rescue I cut to 40 some odd year later we go to Kenya and we be walk we arrive at the opening of this house and Agnes have not let I come to the house for day because they be prepare this whole ritual I want to tell you a great story when Agnes first start fight to stop female genital mutilation in she community she have become a outcast and she be exile and slander and the whole community turn against she but be a vagina warrior she keep go and she keep commit herself to transform consciousness and in the Maasai community goat and cow be the most value possession they be like the Mercedes Benz of the Rift Valley and she say two day before the house open two different person arrive to give she a goat each and she say to I I know then that female genital mutilation would end one day in Africa anyway we arrive and when we arrive there be hundred of girl dress in red homemade dress which be the color of the Maasai and the color of V Day and they greet we they have make up this song that they be sing about the end of suffering and the end of mutilation and they walk we down the path it be a gorgeous day in the African sun and the dust be fly and the girl be dance and there be this house and it say V Day Safe House for the girl and it hit I in that moment that it have take 47 year but that Mr Alligator have finally show up and he have show up obviously in a form that it take I a long time to understand which be that when we give in the world what we want the most we heal the broken part inside each of we and I feel in the last eight year that this journey this miraculous vagina journey have teach I this really simple thing which be that happiness exist in action it exist in tell the truth and say what you truth be and it exist in give away what you want the most and I feel that knowledge and that journey have be a extraordinary privilege and I feel really bless to have be here today to communicate that to you thank you very much applause
