jackass swami laughter I know I have something I have basically distil a very difficult to explain and complex philosophy which I will not get into here because it be a little too deep for all of you but laughter it be about what make website popular and you know it be DANCE like a idiot and do not sell anything it be unfortunate that I do not have more time maybe I can come back next year or something like that laughter I be obsess with email I get a lot of it four year later I still get probably two or three hundred email a day from person I do not know and it be be a amazing opportunity to kind of get to know different culture you know it be like a microscope to the rest of the world you can kind of peer into other person life and I also feel like I get a lot of inspiration from the average user for example somebody write hey Ze if you ever come to Boulder you should rock out with we and I say why wait rock out Video Music and they say hey Ze thanks for rock out but I mean the kind of rock out where we would be naked laughter and that be embarrassing but you know it be kind of a collaboration between I and the fan so I say sure rock out naked video music laughter I hear a lot of you whisper laughter and I know what you be say holy crap how be he presentation so smooth laughter and I have to say that it be not all I this year I guess Chris have to take some credit here because in year past I guess there be be some sort of subpar speaker at TED I do not know and so this year Chris send we a TED conference simulator laughter which really allow we as speaker to get there in the trench and practice at home so that we would be ready for this experience and I have get to say that you know it be really really great to be here pre record applause I would like to tell

but supposedly there be ton of money I mean like I think 100 000 dollar or so a year be be spend on this thing so I decide to try my hand I come up with a few game laughter this be call atheist I figure it would be popular with the young kid ok look I will move around and say some thing sigh game over there be no replay laughter so that do not go over so well laughter I do not really understand why you be laugh laughter should have do this before I try to pitch it buddhist of course look very very similar to atheist laughter but you come back as a duck laughter and this be great because you know for a quarter you can play this for a long time laughter and Chris have say in a email that we should really bring something new to TED something that we have not show anyone so I make this for TED it be Christian it be the third in the series I be hope it be go to do well this year sigh laughter do you have a preference laughter good choice laughter so you can wait for the second come which be a random number between one and 500 million laughter so really what be we talk about here oh tech joy laughter tech joy to I mean something because I get a lot of joy out of tech and in fact make thing use technology and I be be serious here even though I be use my sarcastic voice I will not hold on make thing you know make thing actually do give I a lot of joy it be the process of creation that keep I sort of a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety in my life and it be that feeling of be about 80 percent complete on a project where you know you still have something to do but it be not finish and you be not start something that really fill my entire life and so what I have do be I start get interested in create online social space to share that feeling with person who do not consider themselves artist we be in a culture of guru ship it be so hard to use some software because you know it be unapproachable person feel like they have to read the manual so I try to create this very minimal activity that allow person to express themselves and hopefully the end by the Doors whoa I be like on the page but it do not exist laughter it be like seriously though laughter I try to create meaningful environment for person to express themselves laughter here I create a contest call when Office Supplies Attack which I think really resonate with the work population laughter over 500 entry in three week Toilet paper fashion laughter again person from all over the country the watch be particularly incredible laughter online draw tool you have probably see a lot of they I think they be wonderful it be a chance for person to get to play with crayon and all that kind of stuff but I be interested in the process of create as the real event that I be interested in and the problem be that a lot of person suck at drawing and they get bum out at this sort of you know stick figure awful little thing that they create and eventually it just make they stop play with it or they draw penis and thing like that laughter so the scribbler be a attempt to create a generative tool in other word it be a help tool you can draw you simple stick figure and it collaborate with you to create sort of a post war German etching laughter in fact it be tune to be good at draw thing that look bad so we go ahead and we start scribble so the idea be that you can really you know partake in this process but watch something really crappy look beautiful and here be some of my favorite this be the little trap marionette that be submit to I very cool laughter Darling Beautiful stuff I mean this be incredible a 11 year old girl draw this and submit it it be just gorgeous laughter I be dead serious here this be not a joke laughter but I think it be a really fun and wonderful thing so this be call the Fiction Project this be a online space which be basically a refurbish message board that encourage collaborative fiction writing this be haikus none of the haikus be write by the same person in fact each line be contribute by a different person at a different time I think that the now tie up tie down mistress cruel approach I now tie down it be up it be a amazing way and I will tell you if you come home and you spouse or whoever it be say let talk that like chill you to the very core laughter but it be peripheral activity like this that allow person to get together do fun thing they actually get to know each other and it be sort of like low threshold peripheral activity that I think be the key to bring up some of we bond social capital that we be lack and very very quickly I love puppet here be a puppet it dance to music Lotte Reiniger a amazing shadow puppeteer in the 20 that start do more elaborate thing I become interested in puppet and I just want to show one last thing to you oh this be how you make puppet applause Chris Anderson lady and gentleman Mr Ze Frank applause
