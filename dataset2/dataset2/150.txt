I live and work from Tokyo Japan and I specialize in human behavioral research and apply what we learn to think about the future in different way and to design for that future and you know to be honest I have be do this for seven year and I have not get a clue what the future be go to be like but I have get a pretty good idea how person will behave when they get there this be my office it be out there it be not in the lab and it be increasingly in place like India China Brazil Africa we live on a planet 6 3 billion person about three billion person by the end of this year will have cellular connectivity and it will take about another two year to connect the next billion after that and I mention this because if we want to design for that future we need to figure out what that person be about and that be kind of where I see what my job be and what we team job be we research often start with a very simple question so I will give you a example what do you carry if you think of everything in you life that you own when you walk out that door what do you consider to take with you when you be look around what do you consider of that stuff what do you carry and of that stuff what do you actually use so this be interesting to we because the conscious and subconscious decision process imply that the stuff that you do take with you and end up use have some kind of spiritual emotional or functional value and to put it really bluntly you know person be willing to pay for stuff that have value right so I have probably do about five year research look at what person carry I go in person bag I look in person pocket purse I go in they home and we do this worldwide and we follow they around town with video camera it be kind of like stalk with permission and we do all this and to go back to the original question what do person carry and it turn out that person carry a lot of stuff ok that be fair enough but if you ask person what the three most important thing that they carry be across culture and across gender and across context most person will say key money and if they own one a mobile phone and I be not say this be a good thing but this be a thing right I mean I could not take you phone off you if I want to you would probably kick I out or something ok it might seem like a obvious thing for someone who work for a mobile phone company to ask but really the question be why right so why be this thing so important in we life and it turn out from we research that it boil down to survival survival for we and survival for we love one so key provide a access to shelter and warmth transport as well in the U S increasingly money be useful for buy food sustenance among all its other use and a mobile phone it turn out be a great recovery tool if you prefer this kind of Maslow hierarchy of need that three object be very good at support the low ring in Maslow hierarchy of need yes they do a whole bunch of other stuff but they be very good at this and in particular it be the mobile phone ability to allow person to transcend space and time and what I mean by that be you know you can transcend space by simply make a voice call right and you can transcend time by send a message at you convenience and someone else can pick it up at they convenience and this be fairly universally appreciate it turn out which be why we have three billion plus person who have be connect and they value that connectivity but actually you can do this kind of stuff with pc and you can do they with phone kiosk and the mobile phone in addition be both personal and so it also give you a degree of privacy and it be convenient you do not need to ask permission from anyone you can just go ahead and do it right however for this thing to help we survive it depend on they be carry but and it be a pretty big but we forget we be human that be what we do it be one of we feature I think quite a nice feature so we forget but we be also adaptable and we adapt to situation around we pretty well and so we have this strategy to remember and one of they be mention yesterday and it be quite simply the point of reflection and that be that moment when you be walk out of a space and you turn around and quite often you tap you pocket even woman who keep stuff in they bag tap they pocket and you turn around and you look back into the space and some person talk aloud and pretty much everyone do it at some point ok the next thing be most of you if you have a stable home life and what I mean be that you do not travel all the time and always in hotel but most person have what we call a center of gravity and a center of gravity be where you keep this object and this thing do not stay in the center of gravity but over time they gravitate there it be where you expect to find stuff and in fact when you be turn around and you be look inside the house and you be look for this stuff this be where you look first right ok so when we do this research we find the absolutely 100 percent guarantee way to never forget anything ever ever again and that be quite simply to have nothing to remember laughter ok now that sound like something you get on a Chinese fortune cookie right but be in fact about the art of delegation and from a design perspective it be about understand what you can delegate to technology and what you can delegate to other person and it turn out delegation if you want it to be can be the solution for pretty much everything apart from thing like bodily function go to the toilet you can not ask someone to do that on you behalf and apart from thing like entertainment you would not pay for someone to go to the cinema for you and have fun on you behalf or at least not yet maybe sometime in the future we will so let I give you a example of delegation in practice right so this be probably the thing I be most passionate about be the research that we have be do on illiteracy and how person who be illiterate communicate so the u n estimate this be 2004 figure that there be almost 800 million person who can not read and write worldwide so we have be conduct a lot of research and one of the thing we be look at be if you can not read and write if you want to communicate over distance you need to be able to identify the person that you want to communicate with it could be a phone number it could be a e mail address it could be a postal address simple question if you can not read and write how do you manage you contact information and the fact be that million of person do it just from a design perspective we do not really understand how they do it and so that be just one small example of the kind of research that we be do and it turn out that illiterate person be master of delegation so they delegate that part of the task process to other person the stuff that they can not do themselves let I give you another example of delegation this one a little bit more sophisticated and this be from a study that we do in Uganda about how person who be share device use that device Sente be a word in Uganda that mean money it have a second meaning which be to send money as airtime ok and it work like this so let say June you be in a village rural village I be in Kampala and I be the wage earner I be send money back and it work like this so in you village there be one person in the village with a phone and that be the phone kiosk operator and it be quite likely that they would have a quite simple mobile phone as a phone kiosk so what I do be I buy a prepaid card like this and instead of use that money to top up my own phone I call up the local village operator and I read out that number to they and they use it to top up they phone so they be top up the value from Kampala and it be now be top up in the village you take a 10 or 20 percent commission and then you the kiosk operator take 10 or 20 percent commission and pass the rest over to you in cash ok there be two thing I like about this so the first be it turn anyone who have access to a mobile phone anyone who have a mobile phone essentially into a ATM machine it bring rudimentary banking service to place where there be no banking infrastructure and even if they could have access to the banking infrastructure they would not necessarily be consider viable customer because they be not wealthy enough to have bank account there be a second thing I like about this and that be that despite all the resource at my disposal and despite all we kind of apparent sophistication I know I could never have design something as elegant and as totally in tune with the local condition as this ok and yes there be thing like Grameen Bank and micro lending but the difference between this and that be there be no central authority try to control this this be just street up innovation so it turn out the street be a never end source of inspiration for we and ok if you break one of this thing here you return it to the carrier they will give you a new one they will probably give you three new one right I mean that be buy three get one free that kind of thing if you go on the street of India and China you see this kind of stuff and this be where they take the stuff that break and they fix it and they put it back into circulation this be from a workbench in Jilin City in China and you can see person take down a phone and put it back together they reverse engineer manual this be a kind of hacker manual and it be write in Chinese and English they also write they in Hindi you can subscribe to this there be train institute where they be churn out person for fix this thing as well but what I like about this be it boil down to someone on the street with a small flat surface a screwdriver a toothbrush for clean the contact head because they often get dust on the contact head and knowledge and it be all about the social network of the knowledge float around and I like this because it challenge the way that we design stuff and build stuff and potentially distribute stuff it challenge the norm ok for I the street just raise so many different question like this be Viagra that I buy from a backstreet sex shop in China and China be a country where you get a lot of fake and I know what you be ask do I test it I be not go to answer that ok but I look at something like this and I consider the implication of trust and confidence in the purchase process and we look at this and we think well how do that apply for example for the design of the lesson from this apply to the design of online service future service in this market this be a pair of underpants from laughter from Tibet and I look at something like this and honestly you know why would someone design underpants with a pocket right and I look at something like this and it make I question if we be to take all the functionality in thing like this and redistribute they around the body in some kind of personal area network how would we prioritize where to put stuff and yes this be quite trivial but actually the lesson from this can apply to that kind of personal area network and what you see here be a couple of phone number write above the shack in rural Uganda this do not have house number this have phone number so what do it mean when person identity be mobile when that extra three billion person identity be mobile it be not fix you notion of identity be out of date already ok for that extra three billion person this be how it be shift and then I go to this picture here which be the one that I start with and this be from Delhi it be from a study we do into illiteracy and it be a guy in a teashop you can see the chai be pour in the background and he be a you know incredibly poor teashop worker on the low ring in the society and he somehow have the appreciation of the value of Livestrong and it be not necessarily the same value but some kind of value of Livestrong to actually go out and purchase they and actually display they for I this kind of personify this connected world where everything be intertwine and the dot be it be all about the dot join together ok the title of this presentation be connection and consequence and it be really a kind of summary of five year of try to figure out what it be go to be like when everyone on the planet have the ability to transcend space and time in a personal and convenient manner right when everyone be connect and there be four thing so the first thing be the immediacy of idea the speed at which idea go around and I know TED be about big idea but actually the benchmark for a big idea be change if you want a big idea you need to embrace everyone on the planet that be the first thing the second thing be the immediacy of object and what I mean by that be as this become small as the functionality that you can access through this become great thing like banking identity this thing quite simply move very quickly around the world and so the speed of the adoption of thing be just go to become that much more rapid in a way that we just totally can not conceive when you get it to 6 3 billion and the growth in the world population the next thing be that however we design this stuff carefully design this stuff the street will take it and will figure out way to innovate as long as it meet base need the ability to transcend space and time for example and it will innovate in way that we can not anticipate in way that despite we resource they can do it good than we that be my feeling and if we be smart we will look at this stuff that be go on and we will figure out a way to enable it to inform and infuse both what we design and how we design and the last thing be that actually the direction of the conversation with another three billion person connect they want to be part of the conversation and I think we relevance and TED relevance be really about embrace that and learn how to listen essentially and we need to learn how to listen so thank you very very much applause
