you know culture be bear of the imagination and the imagination the imagination as we know it come into be when we species descend from we progenitor Homo erectus and infuse with consciousness begin a journey that would carry it to every corner of the habitable world for a time we share the stage with we distant cousin neanderthal who clearly have some spark of awareness but whether it be the increase in the size of the brain or the development of language or some other evolutionary catalyst we quickly leave neanderthal gasp for survival by the time the last neanderthal disappear in Europe 27 000 year ago we direct ancestor have already and for 5 000 year be crawl into the belly of the earth where in the light of the flicker of tallow candle they have bring into be the great art of the Upper Paleolithic and I spend two month in the cave of southwest France with the poet Clayton Eshleman who write a beautiful book call Juniper Fuse and you could look at this art and you could of course see the complex social organization of the person who bring it into be but more importantly it speak of a deep yearning something far more sophisticated than hunt magic and the way Clayton put it be this way he say you know clearly at some point we be all of a animal nature and at some point we be not and he view proto shamanism as a kind of original attempt through ritual to rekindle a connection that have be irrevocably lose so he see this art not as hunt magic but as postcard of nostalgia and view in that light it take on a whole other resonance and the most amazing thing about the Upper paleolithic art be that as a aesthetic expression it last for almost 20 000 year if this be postcard of nostalgia ours be a very long farewell indeed and it be also the beginning of we discontent because if you want to distill all of we experience since the paleolithic it would come down to two word how and why and this be the sliver of insight upon which culture have be forge now all person share the same raw adaptive imperative we all have child we all have to deal with the mystery of death the world that wait beyond death the elder who fall away into they elderly year all of this be part of we common experience and this should not surprise we because after all biologist have finally prove it to be true something that philosopher have always dream to be true and that be the fact that we be all brother and sister we be all cut from the same genetic cloth all of humanity probably be descend from a thousand person who leave Africa roughly 70 000 year ago but the corollary of that be that if we all be brother and sister and share the same genetic material all human population share the same raw human genius the same intellectual acuity and so whether that genius be place into technological wizardry have be the great achievement of the West or by contrast into unravel the complex thread of memory inherent in a myth be simply a matter of choice and cultural orientation there be no progression of affair in human experience there be no trajectory of progress there be no pyramid that conveniently place Victorian England at the apex and descend down the flank to the so call primitive of the world all people be simply cultural option different vision of life itself but what do I mean by different vision of life make for completely different possibility for existence well let slip for a moment into the great culture sphere ever bring into be by the imagination that of Polynesia 10 000 square kilometer ten of thousand of island fling like jewel upon the southern sea I recently sail on the Hokulea name after the sacred star of Hawaii throughout the South Pacific to make a film about the navigator this be man and woman who even today can name 250 star in the night sky this be man and woman who can sense the presence of distant atoll of island beyond the visible horizon simply by watch the reverberation of wave across the hull of they vessel know full well that every island group in the Pacific have its unique refractive pattern that can be read with the same perspicacity with which a forensic scientist would read a fingerprint this be sailor who in the darkness in the hull of the vessel can distinguish as many as 32 different sea swell move through the canoe at any one point in time distinguish local wave disturbance from the great current that pulsate across the ocean that can be follow with the same ease that a terrestrial explorer would follow a river to the sea indeed if you take all of the genius that allow we to put a man on the moon and apply it to a understanding of the ocean what you would get be Polynesia and if we slip from the realm of the sea into the realm of the spirit of the imagination you enter the realm of Tibetan Buddhism and I recently make a film call the Buddhist Science of the mind why do we use that word science what be science but the empirical pursuit of the truth what be Buddhism but 2 500 year of empirical observation as to the nature of mind I travel for a month in Nepal with we good friend Matthieu Ricard and you will remember Matthieu famously say to all of we here once at TED Western science be a major response to minor need we spend all of we lifetime try to live to be 100 without lose we tooth the Buddhist spend all they lifetime try to understand the nature of existence we billboard celebrate naked child in underwear they billboard be manual prayer to the well be of all sentient creature and with the blessing of Trulshik Rinpoche we begin a pilgrimage to a curious destination accompany by a great doctor and the destination be a single room in a nunnery where a woman have go into lifelong retreat 55 year before and en route we take darshan from Rinpoche and he sit with we and tell we about the Four Noble Truths the essence of the buddhist path all life be suffer that do not mean all life be negative it mean thing happen the cause of suffering be ignorance by that the Buddha do not mean stupidity he mean cling to the illusion that life be static and predictable the third noble truth say that ignorance can be overcome and the fourth and most important of course be the delineation of a contemplative practice that not only have the possibility of a transformation of the human heart but have 2 500 year of empirical evidence that such a transformation be a certainty and so when this door open onto the face of a woman who have not be out of that room in 55 year you do not see a mad woman you see a woman who be more clear than a pool of water in a mountain stream and of course this be what the Tibetan monk tell we they say at one point you know we do not really believe you go to the moon but you do you may not believe that we achieve enlightenment in one lifetime but we do and if we move from the realm of the spirit to the realm of the physical to the sacred geography of Peru I have always be interested in the relationship of indigenous person that literally believe that the Earth be alive responsive to all of they aspiration all of they need and of course the human population have its own reciprocal obligation I spend 30 year live amongst the person of Chinchero and I always hear about a event that I always want to participate in once each year the fast young boy in each hamlet be give the honor of become a woman and for one day he wear the clothing of he sister and he become a transvestite a waylaka and for that day he lead all able bodied man on a run but it be not you ordinary run you start off at 11 500 foot you run down to the base of the sacred mountain Antakillqa you run up to 15 000 foot descend 3 000 foot climb again over the course of 24 hour and of course the waylakama spin the trajectory of the route be mark by holy mound of Earth where coke be give to the Earth libation of alcohol to the wind the vortex of the feminine be bring to the mountaintop and the metaphor be clear you go into the mountain as a individual but through exhaustion through sacrifice you emerge as a community that have once again reaffirm its sense of place in the planet and at 48 I be the only outsider ever to go through this only one to finish it I only manage to do it by chew more coca leaf in one day than anyone in the 4 000 year history of the plant but this localize ritual become pan Andean and this fantastic festival like that of the Qoyllur Rit i which occur when the Pleiades reappear in the winter sky it be kind of like a Andean Woodstock 60 000 Indian on pilgrimage to the end of a dirt road that lead to the sacred valley call the Sinakara which be dominate by three tongue of the great glacier the metaphor be so clear you bring the cross from you community in this wonderful fusion of Christian and pre columbian idea you place the cross into the ice in the shadow of Ausangate the most sacred of all Apus or sacred mountain of the Inca and then you do the ritual dance that empower the cross now this idea and this event allow we even to deconstruct iconic place that many of you have be to like Machu Picchu Machu Picchu be never a lose city on the contrary it be completely link in to the 14 000 kilometer of royal road the Inca make in less than a century but more importantly it be link in to the andean notion of sacred geography the intiwatana the hitching post to the sun be actually a obelisk that constantly reflect the light that fall on the sacred apu of Machu Picchu which be Sugarloaf Mountain call Huayna Picchu if you come to the south of the intiwatana you find a altar climb Huayna Picchu find another altar take a direct north south bear you find to you astonishment that it bisect the intiwatana stone go to the skyline hit the heart of Salcantay the second of the most important mountain of the Incan empire and then beyond Salcantay of course when the southern cross reach the southernmost point in the sky directly in that same alignment the Milky Way overhead but what be envelop Machu Picchu from below the sacred river the Urubamba or the Vilcanota which be itself the earthly equivalent of the Milky Way but it be also the trajectory that Viracocha walk at the dawn of time when he bring the universe into be and where do the river rise right on the slope of the Koariti so 500 year after Columbus this ancient rhythm of landscape be play out in ritual now when I be here at the first TED I show this photograph two man of the elder brother the descendant survivor of El Dorado this of course be the descendant of the ancient Tairona civilization if that of you who be here remember that I mention that they remain rule by a ritual priesthood but the training for the priesthood be extraordinary take from they family sequester in a shadowy world of darkness for 18 year two nine year period deliberately choose to evoke the nine month they spend in the natural mother womb all that time the world only exist as a abstraction as they be teach the value of they society value that maintain the proposition that they prayer and they prayer alone maintain the cosmic balance now the measure of a society be not only what it do but the quality of its aspiration and I always want to go back into this mountain to see if this could possibly be true as indeed have be report by the great anthropologist Reichel Dolmatoff so literally two week ago I return from have spend six week with the elder brother on what be clearly the most extraordinary trip of my life this really be a person who live and breathe the realm of the sacred a baroque religiosity that be simply awesome they consume more coca leaf than any human population half a pound per man per day the gourd you see here be everything in they life be symbolic they central metaphor be a loom they say upon this loom I weave my life they refer to the movement as they exploit the ecological niche of the gradient as thread when they pray for the dead they make this gesture with they hand spin they thought into the heavens you can see the calcium buildup on the head of the poporo gourd the gourd be a feminine aspect the stick be a male you put the stick in the powder to take the sacred ash well they be not ash they be burn limestone to empower the coca leaf to change the ph of the mouth to facilitate the absorption of cocaine hydrochloride but if you break a gourd you can not simply throw it away because every stroke of that stick that have build up that calcium the measure of a man life have a thought behind it Fields be plant in such a extraordinary way that the one side of the field be plant like that by the woman the other side be plant like that by the man metaphorically you turn it on the side and you have a piece of cloth and they be the descendant of the ancient Tairona civilization the great goldsmith of South America who in the wake of the conquest retreat into this isolate volcanic massif that soar to 20 000 foot above the caribbean coastal plain there be four society the Kogi the Wiwa the Kankwano and the Arhuacos I travel with the Arhuacos and the wonderful thing about this story be that this man Danilo Villafane if we just jump back here for a second when I first meet Danilo in the Colombian embassy in Washington I could not help but say you know you look a lot like a old friend of mine well it turn out he be the son of my friend Adalberto from 1974 who have be kill by the FARC and I say Danilo you will not remember this but when you be a infant I carry you on my back up and down the mountain and because of that Danilo invite we to go to the very heart of the world a place where no journalist have ever be permit not simply to the flank of the mountain but to the very iced peak which be the destiny of the pilgrim and this man sit cross legged be now a grow up Eugenio a man who I have know since 1974 and this be one of that initiate no it be not true that they be keep in the darkness for 18 year but they be keep within the confines of the ceremonial man circle for 18 year this little boy will never step outside of the sacred field that surround the man hut for all that time until he begin he journey of initiation for that entire time the world only exist as a abstraction as he be teach the value of society include this notion that they prayer alone maintain the cosmic balance before we could begin we journey we have to be cleanse at the portal of the Earth and it be extraordinary to be take by a priest and you see that the priest never wear shoe because holy foot there must be nothing between the foot and the Earth for a mamo and this be actually the place where the great mother send the spindle into the world that elevate the mountain and create the homeland that they call the heart of the world we travel high into the paramo and as we crest the hill we realize that the man be interpret every single bump on the landscape in term of they own intense religiosity and then of course as we reach we final destination a place call Mamancana we be in for a surprise because the FARC be wait to kidnap we and so we end up be take aside into this hut hide away until the darkness and then abandon all we gear we be force to ride out in the middle of the night in a quite dramatic scene it be go to look like a John Ford Western and we run into a FARC patrol at dawn so it be quite harrowing it will be a very interesting film but what be fascinating be that the minute there be a sense of danger the mamo go into a circle of divination and of course this be a photograph literally take the night we be in hiding as they divine they route to take we out of the mountain we be able to because we have train person in filmmaking continue with we work and send we Wiwa and Arhuaco filmmaker to the final sacred lake to get the last shot for the film and we follow the rest of the Arhuaco back to the sea take the element from the highland to the sea and here you see how they sacred landscape have be cover by brothel and hotel and casino and yet still they pray and it be a amazing thing to think that this close to Miami two hour from Miami there be a entire civilization of person pray every day for you well be they call themselves the elder brother they dismiss the rest of we who have ruin the world as the young brother they can not understand why it be that we do what we do to the Earth now if we slip to another end of the world I be up in the high Arctic to tell a story about global warming inspire in part by the former Vice President wonderful book and what strike I so extraordinary be to be again with the Inuit a person who do not fear the cold but take advantage of it a person who find a way with they imagination to carve life out of that very freeze a person for whom blood on ice be not a sign of death but a affirmation of life and yet tragically when you now go to that northern community you find to you astonishment that whereas the sea ice use to come in in September and stay till July in a place like Kanak in northern Greenland it literally come in now in November and stay until March so they entire year have be cut in half now I want to stress that none of this people that I have be quickly talk about here be disappear world this be not die people on the contrary you know if you have the heart to feel and the eye to see you discover that the world be not flat the world remain a rich tapestry it remain a rich topography of the spirit this myriad voice of humanity be not fail attempt at be new fail attempt at be modern they be unique facet of the human imagination they be unique answer to a fundamental question what do it mean to be human and alive and when ask that question they respond with 6 000 different voice and collectively that voice become we human repertoire for deal with the challenge that will confront we in the ensue millennia we industrial society be scarcely 300 year old that shallow history should not suggest to anyone that we have all of the answer for all of the question that will confront we in the ensue millennia the myriad voice of humanity be not fail attempt at be we they be unique answer to that fundamental question what do it mean to be human and alive and there be indeed a fire burn over the Earth take with it not only plant and animal but the legacy of humanity brilliance right now as we sit here in this room of that 6 000 language speak the day that you be bear fully half be not be teach to child so you be live through a time when virtually half of humanity intellectual social and spiritual legacy be be allow to slip away this do not have to happen this people be not fail attempt at be modern quaint and colorful and destine to fade away as if by natural law in every case this be dynamic live people be drive out of existence by identifiable force that be actually a optimistic observation because it suggest that if human being be the agent of cultural destruction we can also be and must be the facilitator of cultural survival thank you very much
