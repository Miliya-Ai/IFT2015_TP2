this be a guy name Bob McKim he be a creativity researcher in the 60 and 70 and also lead the Stanford Design Program and in fact my friend and IDEO founder David Kelley who out there somewhere study under he at Stanford and he like to do a exercise with he student where he get they to take a piece of paper and draw the person who sit next to they they neighbor very quickly just as quickly as they could and in fact we be go to do that exercise right now you all have a piece of cardboard and a piece of paper it actually get a bunch of circle on it I need you to turn that piece of paper over you should find that it blank on the other side and there should be a pencil and I want you to pick somebody that seat next to you and when I say go you have get 30 second to draw you neighbor ok so everybody ready ok off you go you have get 30 second you would well be fast come on that masterpiece ok stop all right now laughter yes lot of laughter yeah exactly lot of laughter quite a bit of embarrassment laughter be I hear a few sorry I think I be hear a few sorry yup yup I think I probably be and that exactly what happen every time every time you do this with adult McKim find this every time he do it with he student he get exactly the same response lot and lot of sorry laughter and he would point this out as evidence that we fear the judgment of we peer and that we be embarrassed about show we idea to person we think of as we peer to that around we and this fear be what cause we to be conservative in we think so we might have a wild idea but we be afraid to share it with anybody else ok so if you try the same exercise with kid they have no embarrassment at all they just quite happily show they masterpiece to whoever want to look at it but as they learn to become adult they become much more sensitive to the opinion of other and they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarrassed and in study of kid play it be show time after time that kid who feel secure who be in a kind of trusted environment they be the one that feel most free to play and if you be start a design firm let say then you probably also want to create a place where person have the same kind of security where they have the same kind of security to take risk maybe have the same kind of security to play before find IDEO David say that what he want to do be to form a company where all the employee be my good friend now that be not just self indulgence he know that friendship be a short cut to play and he know that it give we a sense of trust and it allow we then to take the kind of creative risk that we need to take as designer and so that decision to work with he friend now he have 550 of they be what get IDEO start and we studio like I think many creative workplace today be design to help person feel relaxed familiar with they surroundings comfortable with the person that they be work with it take more than decor but I think we have all see that creative company do often have symbol in the workplace that remind person to be playful and that it a permissive environment so whether it this microbus meeting room that we have in one we build at IDEO or at Pixar where the animator work in wooden hut and decorate cave or at the Googleplex where it famous for its beach volleyball court and even this massive dinosaur skeleton with pink flamingo on it do not know the reason for the pink flamingo but anyway they be there in the garden or even in the Swiss office of Google which perhaps have the most wacky idea of all and my theory be that so the Swiss can prove to they Californian colleague that they be not boring so they have the slide and they even have a fireman pole do not know what they do with that but they have one so all of this place have this symbol now we big symbol at IDEO be actually not so much the place it a thing and it actually something that we invent a few year ago or create a few year ago it a toy it call a finger blaster and I forget to bring one up with I so if somebody can reach under the chair that next to they you will find something tape underneath it that great if you could pass it up thanks David I appreciate it so this be a finger blaster and you will find that every one of you have get one tape under you chair and I be go to run a little experiment another little experiment but before we start I need just to put this on thank you all right now what I be go to do be I be go to see how I can not see out of this ok i be go to see how many of you at the back of the room can actually get that thing onto the stage so the way they work be you know you just put you finger in the thing pull they back and off you go so do not look backwards that my only recommendation here I want to see how many of you can get this thing on the stage so come on there we go there we go thank you thank you oh I have another idea I want to there we go laughter there we go laughter thank you thank you thank you not bad not bad no serious injury so far laughter well they be still come in from the back there they be still come in some of you have not fire they yet can you not figure out how to do it or something it not that hard most of you kid figure out how to do this in the first 10 second when they pick it up all right this be pretty good this be pretty good okay all right let I suppose we have good I have well clear this up out of the way otherwise I be go to trip over they all right so the rest of you can save they for when I say something particularly boring and then you can fire at i laughter all right I think I be go to take this off now because I can not see a damn thing when I have all right ok so ah that be fun laughter all right good applause so ok so why so we have the finger blaster other person have dinosaur you know why do we have they well as I say we have they because we think maybe playfulness be important but why be it important we use it in a pretty pragmatic way to be honest we think playfulness help we get to well creative solution help we do we job well and help we feel well when we do they now a adult encounter a new situation when we encounter a new situation we have a tendency to want to categorize it just as quickly as we can you know and there a reason for that we want to settle on a answer life complicate we want to figure out what go on around we very quickly I suspect actually that the evolutionary biologist probably have lot of reason for why we want to categorize new thing very very quickly one of they might be you know when we see this funny stripy thing be that a tiger just about to jump out and kill we or be it just some weird shadow on the tree we need to figure that out pretty fast well at least we do once most of we do not need to anymore I suppose this be some aluminum foil right you use it in the kitchen that what it be be not it of course it be of course it be well not necessarily laughter kid be more engaged with open possibility now they will certainly when they come across something new they will certainly ask what be it of course they will but they will also ask what can I do with it and you know the more creative of they might get to a really interesting example and this openness be the beginning of exploratory play any parent of young kid in the audience there must be some yeah thought so so we have all see it have not we we have all tell story about how on Christmas morning we kid end up play with the box far more than they play with the toy that be inside they and you know from a exploration perspective this behavior make complete sense because you can do a lot more with box than you can do with a toy even one like say tickle I elmo which despite its ingenuity really only do one thing whereas box offer a infinite number of choice so again this be another one of that playful activity that as we get old we tend to forget and we have to relearn so another one of Bob McKim favorite exercise be call the 30 circle test so we be back to work you guy be go to get back to work again turn that piece of paper that you do the sketch on back over and you will find that 30 circle print on the piece of paper so it should look like this you should be look at something like this so what I be go to do be I be go to give you minute and I want you to adapt as many of that circle as you can into object of some form so for example you could turn one into a football or another one into a sun all I be interested in be quantity I want you to do as many of they as you can in the minute that I be just about to give you so everybody ready ok off you go okay put down you pencil as they say so who get more than five circle figure out hopefully everybody more than 10 keep you hand up if you do 10 15 20 anybody get all 30 no oh somebody do fantastic do anybody to a variation on a theme like a smiley face happy face sad face sleepy face anybody do that anybody use my example the sun and the football great cool so I be really interested in quantity I be not actually very interested in whether they be all different I just want you to fill in as many circle as possible and one of the thing we tend to do as adult again be we edit thing we stop ourselves from do thing we self edit as we be have idea and in some case we desire to be original be actually a form of editing and that actually be not necessarily really playful so that ability just to go for it and explore lot of thing even if they do not seem that different from each other be actually something that kid do well and it be a form of play so now Bob McKim do another version of this test in a rather famous experiment that be do in the 1960 anybody know what this be it the peyote cactus it the plant from which you can create mescaline one of the psychedelic drug for that of you around in the 60 you probably know it well McKim publish a paper in 1966 describe a experiment that he and he colleague conduct to test the effect of psychedelic drug on creativity so he pick 27 professional they be engineer physicist mathematician architect furniture designer even artist and he ask they to come along one evening and to bring a problem with they that they be work on he give each of they some mescaline and have they listen to some nice relaxing music for a while and then he do what call the Purdue Creativity Test you might know it as how many use can you find for a paper clip it basically the same thing as the 30 circle thing that I just have you do now actually he give the test before the drug and after the drug to see what the difference be in person facility and speed with come up with idea and then he ask they to go away and work on that problem that they would bring and they would come up with a bunch of interesting solution and actually quite valid solution to the thing that they would be work on and so some of the thing that they figure out some of this individual figure out in one case a new commercial building and design for house that be accept by client a design of a solar space probe experiment a redesign of the linear electron accelerator a engineering improvement to a magnetic tape recorder you can tell this be a while ago the completion of a line of furniture and even a new conceptual model of the photon so it be a pretty successful evening in fact maybe this experiment be the reason that Silicon Valley get off to its great start with innovation we do not know but it may be we need to ask some of the ceo whether they be involve in this mescaline experiment but really it be not the drug that be important it be this idea that what the drug do would help shock person out of they normal way of thinking and get they to forget the adult behavior that be get in the way of they idea but it hard to break we habit we adult habit at IDEO we have brainstorming rule write on the wall edict like Defer judgment or go for quantity and somehow that seem wrong I mean can you have rule about creativity well it sort of turn out that we need rule to help we break the old rule and norm that otherwise we might bring to the creative process and we have certainly learn that over time you get much good brainstorming much more creative outcome when everybody do play by the rule now of course many designer many individual designer achieve this be in a much more organic way I think the Eameses be wonderful example of experimentation and they experiment with plywood for many year without necessarily have one single goal in mind they be explore follow what be interesting to they they go from design splint for wounded soldier come out of World War II and the Korean War I think and from this experiment they move on to chair through constant experimentation with material they develop a wide range of iconic solution that we know today eventually result in of course the legendary lounge chair now if the Eameses have stop with that first great solution then we would not be the beneficiary of so many wonderful design today and of course they use experimentation in all aspect of they work from film to building from game to graphic so they be great example I think of exploration and experimentation in design now while the Eameses be explore that possibility they be also explore physical object and they be do that through building prototype and building be the next of the behavior that I think I would talk about so the average western first grader spend as much as 50 percent of they play time take part in what call construction play construction play it playful obviously but also a powerful way to learn when play be about build a tower out of block the kid begin to learn a lot about tower and as they repeatedly knock it down and start again learn be happen as a sort of by product of play it classically learn by do now David Kelley call this behavior when it carry out by designer think with you hand and it typically involve make multiple low resolution prototype very quickly often by bring lot of find element together in order to get to a solution on one of he early project the team be kind of stuck and they come up with a mechanism by hack together a prototype make from a roll on deodorant now that become the first commercial computer mouse for the Apple Lisa and the Macintosh so they learn they way to that by build prototype another example be a group of designer who be work on a surgical instrument with some surgeon they be meet with they they be talk to the surgeon about what it be they need with this device and one of the designer run out of the room and grab a white board marker and a film canister which be now become a very precious prototype medium and a clothespin he tape they all together run back into the room and say you mean something like this and the surgeon grab hold of it and say well I want to hold it like this or like that and all of a sudden a productive conversation be happen about design around a tangible object and in the end it turn into a real device and so this behavior be all about quickly get something into the real world and have you think advance as a result at IDEO there a kind of a back to preschool feel sometimes about the environment the prototype cart fill with colored paper and play doh and glue stick and stuff I mean they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to they but the important idea be that everything at hand everything around so when designer be work on idea they can start build stuff whenever they want they do not necessarily even have to go into some kind of formal workshop to do it and we think that pretty important and then the sad thing be although preschool be full of this kind of stuff as kid go through the school system it all get take away they lose this stuff that facilitate this sort of playful and building mode of think and of course by the time you get to the average workplace maybe the good construction tool we have might be the Post it note it pretty barren but by give project team and the client who they be work with permission to think with they hand quite complex idea can spring into life and go right through to execution much more easily this be a nurse use a very simple as you can see plasticine prototype explain what she want out of a portable information system to a team of technologist and designer that be work with she in a hospital and just have this very simple prototype allow she to talk about what she want in a much more powerful way and of course by build quick prototype we can get out and test we idea with consumer and user much more quickly than if we be try to describe they through word but what about design something that be not physical something like a service or a experience something that exist as a series of interaction over time instead of building play this can be approach with role play so if you be design a interaction between two person such as I do not know order food at a fast food joint or something you need to be able to imagine how that experience might feel over a period of time and I think the good way to achieve that and get a feeling for any flaw in you design be to act it out so we do quite a lot of work at IDEO try to convince we client of this they can be a little skeptical I will come back to that but a place I think where the effort be really worthwhile be where person be wrestle with quite serious problem thing like education or security or finance or health and this be another example in a healthcare environment of some doctor and some nurse and designer act out a service scenario around patient care but you know many adult be pretty reluctant to engage with role play some of it embarrassment and some of it be because they just do not believe that what emerge be necessarily valid they dismiss a interesting interaction by say you know that just happen because they be act it out Research into kid behavior actually suggest that it worth take role play seriously because when child play a role they actually follow social script quite closely that they have learn from we as adult if one kid play store and another one play house then the whole kind of play fall down so they get use to quite quickly to understand the rule for social interaction and be actually quite quick to point out when they be break so when as adult we role play then we have a huge set of this script already internalize we have go through lot of experience in life and they provide a strong intuition as to whether a interaction be go to work so we be very good when act out a solution at spot whether something lack authenticity so role play be actually I think quite valuable when it come to think about experience another way for we as designer to explore role play be to put ourselves through a experience which we be design for and project ourselves into a experience so here be some designer who be try to understand what it might feel like to sleep in a confine space on a airplane and so they grab some very simple material you can see and do this role play this kind of very crude role play just to get a sense of what it would be like for passenger if they be stick in quite small place on airplane this be one of we designer Kristian Simsarian and he put himself through the experience of be a er patient now this be a real hospital in a real emergency room one of the reason he choose to take this rather large video camera with he be because he do not want the doctor and nurse think he be actually sick and stick something into he that he be go to regret later so anyhow he go there with he video camera and it kind of interesting to see what he bring back because when we look at the video when he get back we see 20 minute of this laughter and also the amazing thing about this video as soon as you see it you immediately project yourself into that experience and you know what it feel like all of that uncertainty while you be leave out in the hallway while the doc be deal with some more urgent case in one of the emergency room wonder what the heck go on and so this notion of use role play or in this case live through the experience as a way of create empathy particularly when you use video be really powerful or another one of we designer Altay Sendil he here have he chest wax not because he very vain although actually he be no I be kid but in order to empathize with the pain that chronic care patient go through when they be have dress remove and so sometimes this analogous experience analogous role play can also be quite valuable so when a kid dress up as a firefighter you know he begin to try on that identity he want to know what it feel like to be a firefighter we be do the same thing as designer we be try on this experience and so the idea of role play be both as a empathy tool as well as a tool for prototype experience and you know we kind of admire person who do this at IDEO anyway not just because they lead to insight about the experience but also because of they willingness to explore and they ability to unselfconsciously surrender themselves to the experience in short we admire they willingness to play playful exploration playful building and role play that be some of the way that designer use play in they work and so far I admit this might feel like it a message just to go out and play like a kid and to certain extent it be but I want to stress a couple of point the first thing to remember be that play be not anarchy play have rule especially when it group play when kid play tea party or they play cop and robber they be follow a script that they have agree to and it this code negotiation that lead to productive play so remember the sketch task we do at the begin the kind of little face the portrait you do well imagine if you do the same task with friend while you be drink in a pub but everybody agree to play a game where the bad sketch artist buy the next round of drink that framework of rule would have turn a embarrassing difficult situation into a fun game as a result we would all feel perfectly secure and have a good time but because we all understand the rule and we agree on they together but there be not just rule about how to play there be rule about when to play kid do not play all the time obviously they transition in and out of it and good teacher spend a lot of time think about how to move kid through this experience as designer we need to be able to transition in and out of play also and if we be run design studio we need to be able to figure out how can we transition designer through this different experience I think this be particularly true if we think about the sort of I think what very different about design be that we go through this two very distinctive mode of operation we go through a sort of generative mode where we be explore many idea and then we come back together again and come back look for that solution and develop that solution I think they be two quite different mode divergence and convergence and I think it probably in the divergent mode that we most need playfulness perhaps in convergent mode we need to be more serious and so be able to move between that mode be really quite important so it where there a more nuanced version view of play I think be require because it very easy to fall into the trap that this state be absolute you be either playful or you be serious and you can not be both but that not really true you can be a serious professional adult and at time be playful it not a either or it a and you can be serious and play so to sum it up we need trust to play and we need trust to be creative so there a connection and there be a series of behavior that we have learn as kid and that turn out to be quite useful to we as designer they include exploration which be about go for quantity building and thinking with you hand and role play where act it out help we both to have more empathy for the situation in which we be design and to create service and experience that be seamless and authentic thank you very much applause
