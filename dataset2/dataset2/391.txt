tree be wonderful arena for discovery because of they tall stature they complex structure the biodiversity they foster and they quiet beauty I use to climb tree for fun all the time and now as a grow up I have make my profession understanding tree and forest through the medium of science the most mysterious part of forest be the upper tree canopy and Dr Terry Erwin in 1983 call the canopy the last biotic frontier I would like to take you all on a journey up to the forest canopy and share with you what canopy researcher be ask and also how they be communicate with other person outside of science let start we journey on the forest floor of one of my study site in Costa Rica because of the overhang leaf and branch you will notice that the understory be very dark it be very still and what I would like to do be take you up to the canopy not by put all of you into rope and harness but rather show you a very short clip from a National Geographic film call Heroes of the high Frontier this be film in Monteverde Costa Rica and I think it give we the good impression of what it be like to climb a giant strangler fig music growl rustling so what you will see up there be that it be really like the atmosphere of a open field and there be tremendous number of plant and animal that have adapt to make they way and they life in the canopy common group like the sloth here have clear adaptation for forest canopy hang on with they very strong claw but I would like to describe to you a more subtle kind of diversity and tell you about the ant there be 10 000 species of ant that taxonomist person who describe and name animal have name 4 000 of that ant live exclusively in the forest canopy one of the reason I tell you about ant be because of my husband who be in fact a ant taxonomist and when we get marry he promise to name a ant after I which he do Procryptocerus nalini a canopy ant we have have two child August Andrew and Erika and actually he name ant after they so we may be the only family that have a ant name after each one of we but my passion in addition to Jack and my child be the plant the so call epiphyte that plant that grow up on tree they do not have root that go into trunk nor to the forest floor but rather it be they leaf that be adapt to intercept the dissolve nutrient that come to they in the form of mist and fog this plant occur in great diversity over 28 000 species around the world they grow in tropical forest like this one and they also grow in temperate rainforest that we find in Washington state this epiphyte be mainly dominate by the moss one thing I want to point out be that underneath this live epiphyte as they die and decompose they actually construct a arboreal soil both in the temperate zone and in the tropics and this moss generate by decompose be like peat moss in you garden they have a tremendous capacity for hold on to nutrient and water one of the surprising thing I discover be that if you pull back with I on that mat of epiphyte what you will find underneath they be connection network of what we call canopy root this be not epiphyte root this be root that emerge from the trunk and branch of the host tree themselves and so that epiphyte be actually pay the landlord a bit of rent in exchange for be support high above the forest floor I be interested and my canopy researcher colleague have be interested in the dynamics of the canopy plant that live in the forest we have do strip experiment where we have remove mat of epiphyte and look at the rate of recolonization we have predict that they would grow back very quickly and that they would come in encroach from the side what we find however be that they take a extremely long time over 20 year to regenerate start from the bottom and grow up and even now after 25 year they be not up there they have not recolonize completely and I use this little image to say this be what happen to moss if it be go it be go and if you be really lucky you might get something grow back from the bottom laughter so recolonization be really very slow this canopy community be fragile well when we look out you and I over that canopy of the intact primary forest what we see be this enormous carpet of carbon one of the challenge that canopy researcher be attack today be try to understand the amount of carbon that be be sequester we know it be a lot but we do not yet know the answer to how much and by what process carbon be be take out of the atmosphere hold in its biomass and move on through the ecosystem so I hope I have show you that canopy dweller be not just insignificant bit of green up high in the canopy that Tarzan and Jane be interested in but rather that they foster biodiversity contribute to ecosystem nutrient cycle and they also help to keep we global climate stable up in the canopy if you be sit next to I and you turn around from that primary forest ecosystem you would also see scene like this Scenes of forest destruction forest harvesting and forest fragmentation thereby make that intact tapestry of the canopy unable to function in the marvelous way that it have when it be not disturb by human I have also look out on urban place like this and think about person who be disassociate from tree in they life person who grow up in a place like this do not have the opportunity to climb tree and form a relationship with tree and forest as I do when I be a young girl this trouble I here in 2009 you know it be not a easy thing to be a forest ecologist grip ourselves with this kind of question and try to figure out how we can answer they and especially you know as a small brown woman in a little college in the upper northwest part of we country far away from the area of power and money I really have to ask myself what can I do about this how can I reconnect person with tree well I think that I can do something I know that as a scientist I have information and as a human being I can communicate with anybody inside or outside of academia and so that be what I have begin do and so I would like to unveil the International Canopy Network here we consult to the media about canopy question we have a canopy newsletter we have a email listserv and so we be try to disseminate information about the importance of the canopy the beauty of the canopy the necessity of intact canopy to person outside of academia we also recognize that a lot of the product that we make that video and so forth you know they do not reach everybody and so we have be foster project that reach person outside of academia and outside of the choir that most ecologist preach to Treetop Barbie be a great example of that what we do my student in my lab and I be we buy barby from Goodwill and Value Village we dress she in clothes that have be make by seamstress and we send she out with a canopy handbook and my feeling be applause thank you applause that we have take this pop icon and we have just tweak she a little bit to become a ambassador who can carry the message that be a woman scientist study treetop be actually a really great thing we have also make partnership with artist with person who understand and can communicate the aesthetic beauty of tree and forest canopy and I would like to just tell you one of we project which be the generation of Canopy Confluences what I do be I bring together scientist and artist of all kind and we spend a week in the forest on this little platform and we look at nature we look at tree we look at the canopy and we communicate and exchange and express what we see together the result have be fantastic I will just give you a few example this be a fantastic installation by Bruce Chao who be chair of the sculpture and Glass Blowing Department at Rhode Island School of Design he see nest in the canopy at one of we canopy Confluences in the Pacific Northwest and create this beautiful sculpture we have have dance person up in the canopy Jodi Lomask and she wonderful troupe Capacitor join I in the canopy in my rainforest site in Costa Rica they make a fabulous dance call biome they dance in the forest and we be take this dance my scientific outreach communication and also link up with environmental group to go to different city and to perform the science the dance and the environmental outreach that we hope will make a difference we bring musician to the canopy and they make they music and it be fantastic music we have wooden flutist we have oboist we have opera singer we have guitar player and we have rap singer and I bring a little segment to give you of Duke Brady Canopy Rap Music that be Duke applause this experience of work with Duke also lead I to initiate a program call Sound Science I see the power of Duke song with urban youth a audience you know I as a middle aged professor I do not have a hope of get to in term of convince they of the importance of wildland so I engage caution this rap singer with a group of young person from inner city Tacoma we go out to the forest I would pick up a branch caution would rap on it and suddenly that branch be really cool and then the student would come into we sound studio they would make they own rap song with they own beat they end up make a cd which they take home to they family and friend thereby express they own experience with nature in they own medium the final project I will talk about be one that be very close to my heart and it involve a economic and social value that be associate with epiphytic plant in the Pacific Northwest there be a whole industry of moss harvesting from old growth forest this moss be take from the forest they be use by the floriculture industry by florist to make arrangement and make hang basket it be a 265 million dollar industry and it be increase rapidly if you remember that bald guy you will know that what have be strip off of this trunk in the Pacific Northwest old growth forest be go to take decade and decade to come back so this whole industry be unsustainable what can I as a ecologist do about that well my thought be that I could learn how to grow moss and that way we would not have to take they out of the wild and I think if I have some partner that could help I with this that would be great and so I think perhaps incarcerate man and woman who do not have access to nature who often have a lot of time they often have space and you do not need any sharp tool to work with moss would be great partner and they have become excellent partner the good I can imagine they be very enthusiastic applause they be incredibly enthusiastic about the work they learn how to distinguish different species of moss which to tell you the truth be a lot more than my undergraduate student at the Evergreen College can do and they embrace the idea that they could help develop a research design in order to grow this moss we have be successful as partner in figure out which species grow the fast and I have just be overwhelm with how successful this have be because the prison warden be very enthusiastic about this as well I start a science and sustainability seminar in the prison I bring my scientific colleague and sustainability practitioner into the prison we give talk once a month and that actually end up implement some amazing sustainability project at the prison organic garden worm culture recycling water catchment and beekeep applause we late endeavor with a grantfrom the Department of Corrections at Washington state they have ask we to expand this program to three more prison and we new project be have the inmate and ourselves learn how to raise the Oregon spot frog which be a highly endanger amphibian in Washington state and Oregon so they will raise they in captivity of course from egg to tadpole and onward to frog and they will have the pleasure many of they of see that frog that they have raise from egg and help develop help nurture move out into protect wildland to augment the number of endangered species out there in the wild and so I think for many reason ecological social economic and perhaps even spiritual this have be a tremendous project and I be really look forward to not only myself and my student do it but also to promote and teach other scientist how to do this as many of you be aware the world of academia be a rather inward look one I be try to help researcher move more outward to have they own partnership with person outside of the academic community and so I be hope that my husband Jack the ant taxonomist can perhaps work with Mattel to make Taxonomist Ken perhaps Ben Zander and Bill Gates could get together and make a opera about AIDS or perhaps Al Gore and naturally 7 could make a song about climate change that would really make you clap you hand so although it be a little bit of a fantasy I think it be also a reality give the duress that we be feel environmentally in this time it be time for scientist to reach outward and time for that outside of science to reach towards academia as well I start my career with try to understand the mystery of forest with the tool of science by make this partnership that I describe to you I have really open my mind and I have to say my heart to have a great understanding to make other discovery about nature and myself when I look into my heart I see tree this be actually a image of a real heart there be tree in we heart there be tree in you heart when we come to understand nature we be touch the most deep the most important part of we self in this partnership I have also learn that person tend to compartmentalize themselves into it person and movie star person and scientist but when we share nature when we share we perspective about nature we find a common denominator finally as a scientist and as a person and now as part of the TED community I feel that I have good tool to go out to tree to go out to forest to go out to nature to make new discovery about nature and about human place in nature wherever we be and whomever you be thank you very much applause
