how will we be remember in 200 year I happen to live in a little town Princeton in New Jersey which every year celebrate the great event in Princeton history the battle of Princeton which be in fact a very important battle it be the first battle that George Washington win in fact and be pretty much of a turning point in the war of independence it happen 225 year ago it be actually a terrible disaster for Princeton the town be burn down it be in the middle of winter and it be a very very severe winter and about a quarter of all the person in Princeton die that winter from hunger and cold but nobody remember that what they remember be of course the great triumph that the Brits be beat and we win and that the country be bear and so I agree very emphatically that the pain of childbirth be not remember it be the child that be remember and that be what we be go through at this time I want to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology because I think I know very little about that I be not a biologist so everything I know about it can be say in one minute laughter what I be say be that we should follow the model that have be so successful with the electronic industry that what really turn computer into a great success in the world as a whole be toy as soon as computer become toy when kid could come home and play with they then the industry really take off and that have to happen with biotech there be a huge laughter applause there be a huge community of person in the world who be practical biologist who be dog breeder pigeon breeder orchid breeder rise breeder person who handle biology with they hand and who be dedicate to produce beautiful thing beautiful creature plant animal pet this person will be empower with biotech and that will be a enormous positive step to acceptance of biotechnology that will blow away a lot of the opposition when person have this technology in they hand you have a do it yourself biotech kit grow you own grow you dog grow you own cat laughter applause just buy the software you design it I will not say anymore you can take it on from there it be go to happen and I think it have to happen before the technology become natural become part of the human condition something that everybody be familiar with and everybody accept so let leave that aside I want to talk about something quite different which be what I know about and that be astronomy and I be interested in search for life in the universe and it be open to we to introduce a new way of do that and that be what I will talk about for 10 minute or whatever the time remain the important fact be that most of the real estate that be accessible to we I be not talk about the star I be talk about the solar system the stuff that be within reach for spacecraft and within reach of we earthbound telescope most of the real estate be very cold and very far from the Sun if you look at the solar system as we know it today it have a few planet close to the Sun that be where we live it have a fairly substantial number of asteroid between the orbit of the Earth out through to the orbit of Jupiter the asteroid be a substantial amount of real estate but not very large and it be not very promising for life since most of it consist of rock and metal mostly rock it be not only cold but very dry so the asteroid we do not have much hope for there stand some interesting place a little further out the moon of Jupiter and Saturn particularly there be a place call Europa which be Europa be one of the moon of Jupiter where we see a very level ice surface which look as if it be float on top of a ocean so we believe that on Europa there be in fact a deep ocean and that make it extraordinarily interesting as a place to explore Ocean probably the most likely place for life to originate just as it originate on the Earth so we would love to explore Europa to go down through the ice find out who be swim around in the ocean whether there be fish or seaweed or sea monster whatever there may be that be exciting or cephalopod but that be hard to do unfortunately the ice be thick we do not know just how thick it be probably mile thick so it be very expensive and very difficult to go down there send down you submarine or whatever it be and explore that be something we do not yet know how to do there be plan to do it but it be hard go out a bit far you will find that beyond the orbit of Neptune way out far from the Sun that be where the real estate really begin you will find million or trillion or billion of object which in what we call the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud this be cloud of small object which appear as comet when they fall close to the Sun mostly they just live out there in the cold of the outer solar system but they be biologically very interesting indeed because they consist primarily of ice with other mineral which be just the right one for develop life so if life could be establish out there it would have all the essential chemistry and sunlight everything that be need so what I be propose be that there be where we should be look for life rather than on Mars although Mars be of course also a very promising and interesting place but we can look outside very cheaply and in a simple fashion and that be what I be go to talk about there be a imagine that life originate on Europa and it be sit in the ocean for billion of year it be quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the surface just as it do on the Earth stay in the ocean and evolve in the ocean for 2 billion year finally come out onto the land and then of course it have great much great freedom and a much great variety of creature develop on the land than have ever be possible in the ocean and the step from the ocean to the land be not easy but it happen now if life have originate on Europa in the ocean it could also have move out onto the surface there would not have be any air there it be a vacuum it be out in the cold but it still could have come you can imagine that the plant grow up like kelp through crack in the ice grow on the surface what would they need in order to grow on the surface they would need first of all to have a thick skin to protect themselves from lose water through the skin so they would have to have something like a reptilian skin but good what be more important be that they would have to concentrate sunlight the sunlight in Jupiter on the satellite of Jupiter be 25 time faint than it be here since Jupiter be five time as far from the Sun so they would have to have this creature which I call sunflower which I imagine live on the surface of Europa would have to have either lens or mirror to concentrate sunlight so they could keep themselves warm on the surface otherwise they would be at a temperature of minus 150 which be certainly not favorable for develop life at least of the kind we know but if they just simply could grow like leaf little lens and mirror to concentrate sunlight then they could keep warm on the surface they could enjoy all the benefit of the sunlight and have root go down into the ocean life then could flourish much more so why not look of course it be not very likely that there be life on the surface of Europa none of this thing be likely but my my philosophy be look for what be detectable not for what be probable there be a long history in astronomy of unlikely thing turn out to be there and I mean the fine example of that be radio astronomy as a whole this be originally when radio astronomy begin Mr Jansky at the Bell lab detect radio wave come from the sky and the regular astronomer be scornful about this they say it be all right you can detect radio wave from the Sun but the Sun be the only object in the universe that be close enough and bright enough actually to be detectable you can easily calculate that radio wave from the Sun be fairly faint and everything else in the universe be million of time further away so it certainly will not be detectable so there be no point in look and that of course that set back the progress of radio astronomy by about 20 year since there be nothing there you might as well not look well of course as soon as anybody do look which be after about 20 year when radio astronomy really take off because it turn out the universe be absolutely full of all kind of wonderful thing radiate in the radio spectrum much bright than the Sun so the same thing could be true for this kind of life which I be talk about on cold object that it could in fact be very abundant all over the universe and it be not be detect just because we have not take the trouble to look so the last thing I want to talk about be how to detect it there be something call pit lamping that be the phrase which I learn from my son George who be there in the audience you take that be a Canadian expression if you happen to want to hunt animal at night you take a miner lamp which be a pit lamp you strap it onto you forehead so you can see the reflection in the eye of the animal so if you go out at night you shine a flashlight the animal be bright you see the red glow in they eye which be the reflection of the flashlight and then if you be one of this unsporting character you shoot the animal and take they home and of course that spoil the game for the other hunter who hunt in the daytime so in Canada that be illegal in New Zealand it be legal because the New Zealand farmer use this as a way of get rid of rabbit because the rabbit compete with the sheep in New Zealand so the farmer go out at night with heavily armed jeep and shine the headlight and anything that do not look like a sheep you shoot laughter so I have propose to apply the same trick to look for life in the universe that if this creature who be live on cold surface either on Europa or further out anywhere where you can live on a cold surface that creature must be provide with reflector in order to concentrate sunlight they have to have lens and mirror in order to keep themselves warm and then when you shine sunlight at they the sunlight will be reflect back just as it be in the eye of a animal so this creature will be bright against the cold surroundings and the far out you go in this away from the Sun the more powerful this reflection will be so actually this method of hunt for life get strong and strong as you go further away because the optical reflector have to be more powerful so the reflect light shine out even more in contrast against the dark background so as you go further away from the Sun this become more and more powerful so in fact you can look for this creature with telescope from the earth why be not we do it simply because nobody thought of it yet but I hope that we shall look and with any we probably will not find anything none of this speculation may have any basis in fact but still it be a good chance and of course if it happen it will transform we view of life altogether because it mean that the way life can live out there it have enormous advantage as compare with live on a planet it be extremely hard to move from one planet to another we be have great difficulty at the moment and any creature that live on a planet be pretty well stuck especially if you breathe air it be very hard to get from planet a to planet b because there be no air in between but if you breathe air laughter you be dead laughter as soon as you be off the planet unless you have a spaceship but if you live in a vacuum if you live on the surface of one of this object say in the Kuiper Belt this a object like Pluto or one of the small object in the neighborhood of Pluto and you happen if you be live on the surface there and you get knock off the surface by a collision then it do not change anything all that much you still be on a piece of ice you can still have sunlight and you can still survive while you be travel from one place to another and then if you run into another object you can stay there and colonize the other object so life will spread then from one object to another so if it exist at all in the Kuiper Belt it be likely to be very widespread and you will have then a great competition amongst species darwinian evolution so there will be a huge advantage to the species which be able to jump from one place to another without have to wait for a collision and there will be advantage for spread out long sort of kelp like forest of vegetation I call this creature sunflower they look like maybe like sunflower they have to be all the time point toward the Sun and they will be able to spread out in space because gravity on this object be weak so they can collect sunlight from a big area so they will in fact be quite easy for we to detect so I hope in the next 10 year we will find this creature and then of course we whole view of life in the universe will change if we do not find they then we can create they ourselves laughter that be another wonderful opportunity that be open we can as soon as we have a little bit more understanding of genetic engineering one of the thing you can do with you take it home do it yourself genetic engineering kit laughter be to design a creature that can live on a cold satellite a place like Europa so we could colonize Europa with we own creature that would be a fun thing to do laughter in the long run of course it would also make it possible for we to move out there what be go to happen in the end it be not go to be just human colonize space it be go to be life move out from the Earth move it into its kingdom and the kingdom of life of course be go to be the universe and if life be already there it make it much more exciting in the short run but in the long run if there be no life there we create it ourselves we transform the universe into something much more rich and beautiful than it be today so again we have a big and wonderful future to look forward thank you applause
