that splendid music the come in music the Elephant March from Aida be the music I have choose for my funeral laughter and you can see why it be triumphal I will not feel anything but if I could I would feel triumphal at have live at all and at have live on this splendid planet and have be give the opportunity to understand something about why I be here in the first place before not be here can you understand my quaint English accent laughter like everybody else I be entrance yesterday by the animal session Robert full and Frans Lanting and other the beauty of the thing that they show the only slight jarring note be when Jeffrey Katzenberg say of the mustang the most splendid creature that God put on this earth now of course we know that he do not really mean that but in this country at the moment you can not be too careful laughter I be a biologist and the central theorem of we subject the theory of design Darwin theory of evolution by natural selection in professional circle everywhere it be of course universally accept in non professional circle outside America it be largely ignore but in non professional circle within America it arouse so much hostility laughter it be fair to say that American biologist be in a state of war the war be so worry at present with court case come up in one state after another that I feel I have to say something about it if you want to know what I have to say about darwinism itself I be afraid you be go to have to look at my book which you will not find in the bookstore outside laughter contemporary court case often concern a allegedly new version of creationism call Intelligent Design or ID do not be fool there be nothing new about id it be just creationism under another name rechristen I choose the word advisedly laughter for tactical political reason the argument of so call ID theorist be the same old argument that have be refute again and again since Darwin down to the present day there be a effective evolution lobby coordinate the fight on behalf of science and I try to do all I can to help they but they get quite upset when person like I dare to mention that we happen to be atheist as well as evolutionist they see we as rock the boat and you can understand why Creationists lack any coherent scientific argument for they case fall back on the popular phobia against atheism teach you child evolution in biology class and they will soon move on to drug grand larceny and sexual pre version laughter in fact of course educate theologian from the Pope down be firm in they support of evolution this book find Darwin God by Kenneth Miller be one of the most effective attack on Intelligent Design that I know and it be all the more effective because it be write by a devout Christian person like Kenneth Miller could be call a godsend to the evolution lobby laughter because they expose the lie that evolutionism be as a matter of fact tantamount to atheism person like I on the other hand rock the boat but here I want to say something nice about creationist it be not a thing I often do so listen carefully laughter I think they be right about one thing I think they be right that evolution be fundamentally hostile to religion I have already say that many individual evolutionist like the Pope be also religious but I think they be delude themselves I believe a true understanding of darwinism be deeply corrosive to religious faith now it may sound as though I be about to preach atheism and I want to reassure you that that be not what I be go to do in a audience as sophisticated as this one that would be preach to the choir no what I want to urge upon you laughter instead what I want to urge upon you be militant atheism laughter applause but that be put it too negatively if I be a person who be interested in preserve religious faith I would be very afraid of the positive power of evolutionary science and indeed science generally but evolution in particular to inspire and enthrall precisely because it be atheistic now the difficult problem for any theory of biological design be to explain the massive statistical improbability of live thing statistical improbability in the direction of good design complexity be another word for this the standard creationist argument there be only one they be all reduce to this one take off from a statistical improbability live creature be too complex to have come about by chance therefore they must have have a designer this argument of course shoot itself in the foot any designer capable of design something really complex have to be even more complex himself and that be before we even start on the other thing he be expect to do like forgive sin bless marriage listen to prayer favor we side in a war laughter disapprove of we sex life and so on laughter complexity be the problem that any theory of biology have to solve and you can not solve it by postulate a agent that be even more complex thereby simply compound the problem darwinian natural selection be so stunningly elegant because it solve the problem of explain complexity in term of nothing but simplicity essentially it do it by provide a smooth ramp of gradual step by step increment but here I only want to make the point that the elegance of darwinism be corrosive to religion precisely because it be so elegant so parsimonious so powerful so economically powerful it have the sinewy economy of a beautiful suspension bridge the God theory be not just a bad theory it turn out to be in principle incapable of do the job require of it so return to tactic and the evolution lobby I want to argue that rock the boat may be just the right thing to do my approach to attack creationism be unlike the evolution lobby my approach to attack creationism be to attack religion as a whole and at this point I need to acknowledge the remarkable taboo against speak ill of religion and I be go to do so in the word of the late Douglas Adams a dear friend who if he never come to TED certainly should have be invite Richard Saul Wurman he be Richard Dawkins he be good I think he must have be he begin this speech which be tape record in Cambridge shortly before he die he begin by explain how science work through the testing of hypothesis that be frame to be vulnerable to disproof and then he go on I quote Religion do not seem to work like that it have certain idea at the heart of it which we call sacred or holy what it mean be here be a idea or a notion that you be not allow to say anything bad about you be just not why not because you be not laughter why should it be that it be perfectly legitimate to support the Republican or Democrat this model of economics versus that Macintosh instead of Windows but to have a opinion about how the universe begin about who create the universe no that be holy so we be use to not challenging religious idea and it be very interesting how much of a furor Richard create when he do it he mean I not that one everybody get absolutely frantic about it because you be not allow to say this thing yet when you look at it rationally there be no reason why that idea should not be as open to debate as any other except that we have agree somehow between we that they should not be and that be the end of the quote from Douglas in my view not only be science corrosive to religion religion be corrosive to science it teach person to be satisfied with trivial supernatural non explanation and blind they to the wonderful real explanation that we have within we grasp it teach they to accept authority revelation and faith instead of always insist on evidence there be Douglas Adams magnificent picture from he book last chance to see now there be a typical scientific journal the Quarterly Review of Biology and I be go to put together as guest editor a special issue on the question do a asteroid kill the dinosaur and the first paper be a standard scientific paper present evidence Iridium layer at the k t boundary and potassium argon date crater in Yucatan indicate that a asteroid kill the dinosaur perfectly ordinary scientific paper now the next one the President of the Royal Society have be vouchsafe a strong inner conviction that a asteroid kill the dinosaur laughter it have be privately reveal to Professor Huxtanethat a asteroid kill the dinosaur laughter Professor Hordley be bring up to have total and unquestioning faith laughter that a asteroid kill the dinosaur Professor Hawkins have promulgate a official dogma bind on all loyal Hawkinsians that a asteroid kill the dinosaur laughter that be inconceivable of course but suppose supporter of the asteroid theory can not be patriotic citizen laughter applause in 1987 a reporter ask George Bush Sr whether he recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of American who be atheist Mr Bush reply have become infamous no I do not know that atheist should be consider citizen nor should they be consider patriot this be one nation under God Bush bigotry be not a isolated mistake blurt out in the heat of the moment and later retract he stand by it in the face of repeat call for clarification or withdrawal he really mean it more to the point he know it pose no threat to he election quite the contrary Democrat as well as Republican parade they religiousness if they want to get elect both party invoke one nation under God what would Thomas Jefferson have say in every country and in every age the priest have be hostile to liberty incidentally I be not usually very proud of be British but you can not help make the comparison applause in practice what be a atheist a atheist be just somebody who feel about Yahweh the way any decent Christian feel about Thor or Baal or the golden calf as have be say before we be all atheist about most of the god that humanity have ever believe in some of we just go one god further laughter applause and however we define atheism it be surely the kind of academic belief that a person be entitle to hold without be vilify as a unpatriotic unelectable non citizen nevertheless it be a undeniable fact that to own up to be a atheist be tantamount to introduce yourself as Mr Hitler or Miss Beelzebub and that all stem from the perception of atheist as some kind of weird way out minority Natalie Angier write a rather sad piece in the New Yorker say how lonely she feel as a atheist she clearly feel in a beleaguered minority but actually how do American atheist stack up numerically the late survey make surprisingly encouraging reading Christianity of course take a massive lion share of the population with nearly 160 million but what would you think be the second large group convincingly outnumber Jews with 2 8 million Muslim at 1 1 million Hindus Buddhists and all other religion put together the second large group with nearly 30 million be the one describe as non religious or secular you can not help wonder why vote seek politician be so proverbially overawe by the power of for example the Jewish lobby the state of Israel seem to owe its very existence to the American Jewish vote while at the same time consigning the non religious to political oblivion this secular non religious vote if properly mobilize be nine time as numerous as the Jewish vote why do this far more substantial minority not make a move to exercise its political muscle well so much for quantity how about quality be there any correlation positive or negative between intelligence and tendency to be religious they folk misunderestimate I laughter the survey that I quote which be the ARIS survey do not break down its datum by socio economic class or education iq or anything else but a recent article by Paul G Bell in the Mensa magazine provide some straw in the wind Mensa as you know be a international organization for person with very high iq and from a meta analysis of the literature Bell conclude that I quote of 43 study carry out since 1927 on the relationship between religious belief and one intelligence or educational level all but four find a inverse connection that be the high one intelligence or educational level the less one be likely to be religious well I have not see the original 42 study and I can not comment on that meta analysis but I would like to see more study do along that line and I know that there be if I could put a little plug here there be person in this audience easily capable of finance a massive research survey to settle the question and I put the suggestion up for what it be worth but let I know show you some datum that have be properly publish and analyze on one special group namely top scientist in 1998 Larson and Witham poll the cream of American scientist that who have be honor by election to the National Academy of Sciences and among this select group belief in a personal God drop to a shatter seven percent about 20 percent be agnostic the rest could fairly be call atheist similar figure obtain for belief in personal immortality among biological scientist the figure be even low 5 5 percent only believe in God physical scientist it be 7 5 percent I have not see correspond figure for elite scholar in other field such as history or philosophy but I would be surprised if they be different so we have reach a truly remarkable situation a grotesque mismatch between the American intelligentsia and the American electorate a philosophical opinion about the nature of the universe which be hold by the vast majority of top American scientist and probably the majority of the intelligentsia generally be so abhorrent to the American electorate that no candidate for popular election dare affirm it in public if I be right this mean that high office in the great country in the world be bar to the very person good qualified to hold it the intelligentsia unless they be prepared to lie about they belief to put it bluntly American political opportunity be heavily load against that who be simultaneously intelligent and honest laughter applause I be not a citizen of this country so I hope it will not be think unbecoming if I suggest that something need to be do laughter and I have already hint what that something be from what I have see of TED I think this may be the ideal place to launch it again I fear it will cost money we need a consciousness raise come out campaign for American atheist laughter this could be similar to the campaign organize by homosexual a few year ago although heaven forbid that we should stoop to public outing of person against they will in most case person who out themselves will help to destroy the myth that there be something wrong with atheist on the contrary they will demonstrate that atheist be often the kind of person who could serve as decent role model for you child the kind of person a advertising agent could use to recommend a product the kind of person who be sit in this room there should be a snowball effect a positive feedback such that the more name we have the more we get there could be non linearities threshold effect when a critical mass have be obtain there be a abrupt acceleration in recruitment and again it will need money I suspect that the word atheist itself contain or remain a stumble block far out of proportion to what it actually mean and a stumbling block to person who otherwise might be happy to out themselves so what other word might be use to smooth the path oil the wheel sugar the pill Darwin himself preferred agnostic and not only out of loyalty to he friend Huxley who coin the term Darwin say I have never be a atheist in the same sense of deny the existence of a God I think that generally a agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind he even become uncharacteristically tetchy with Edward Aveling Aveling be a militant atheist who fail to persuade Darwin to accept the dedication of he book on atheism incidentally give rise to a fascinating myth that Karl Marx try to dedicate Das Kapital to Darwin which he do not it be actually Edward Aveling what happen be that Aveling mistress be Marx daughter and when both Darwin and Marx be dead Marx paper become muddle up with Aveling paper and a letter from Darwin say my dear sir thank you very much but I do not want you to dedicate you book to I be mistakenly suppose to be address to Marx and that give rise to this whole myth which you have probably hear it be a sort of urban myth that Marx try to dedicate Kapital to Darwin anyway it be Aveling and when they meet Darwin challenge Aveling why do you call yourselves atheist agnostic retort Aveling be simply atheist writ respectable and atheist be simply agnostic writ aggressive Darwin complain but why should you be so aggressive Darwin think that atheism might be well and good for the intelligentsia but that ordinary person be not quote ripe for it which be of course we old friend the do not rock the boat argument it be not record whether Aveling tell Darwin to come down off he high horse laughter but in any case that be more than 100 year ago you would think we might have grow up since then now a friend a intelligent lapsed Jew who incidentally observe the Sabbath for reason of cultural solidarity describe himself as a tooth fairy agnostic he will not call himself a atheist because it be in principle impossible to prove a negative but agnostic on its own might suggest that God existence be therefore on equal term of likelihood as he non existence so my friend be strictly agnostic about the tooth fairy but it be not very likely be it like God hence the phrase tooth fairy agnostic Bertrand Russell make the same point use a hypothetical teapot in orbit about Mars you would strictly have to be agnostic about whether there be a teapot in orbit about Mars but that do not mean you treat the likelihood of its existence as on all fours with its non existence the list of thing which we strictly have to be agnostic about do not stop at tooth fairy and teapot it be infinite if you want to believe one particular one of they unicorn or tooth fairy or teapot or Yahweh the onus be on you to say why the onus be not on the rest of we to say why not we who be atheist be also a fairyists and a teapotist laughter but we do not bother to say so and this be why my friend use tooth fairy agnostic as a label for what most person would call atheist nonetheless if we want to attract deep down atheist to come out publicly we be go to have find something good to stick on we banner than tooth fairy or teapot agnostic so how about humanist this have the advantage of a worldwide network of well organize association and journal and thing already in place my problem with it be only its apparent anthropocentrism one of the thing we have learn from Darwin be that the human species be only one among million of cousin some close some distant and there be other possibility like naturalist but that also have problem of confusion because Darwin would have think naturalist naturalist means of course as oppose to supernaturalist and it be use sometimes Darwin would have be confuse by the other sense of naturalist which he be of course and I suppose there might be other who would confuse it with nudism laughter such person might be that belong to the British lynch mob which last year attack a pediatrician in mistake for a pedophile laughter I think the good of the available alternative for atheist be simply non theist it lack the strong connotation that there be definitely no God and it could therefore easily be embrace by teapot or tooth fairy agnostic it be completely compatible with the God of the physicist when atheist like Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein use the word God they use it of course as a metaphorical shorthand for that deep mysterious part of physics which we do not yet understand non theist will do for all that yet unlike atheist it do not have the same phobic hysterical response but I think actually the alternative be to grasp the nettle of the word atheism itself precisely because it be a taboo word carry frisson of hysterical phobia critical mass may be hard to achieve with the word atheist than with the word non theist or some other non confrontational word but if we do achieve it with that dread word atheist itself the political impact would be even great now I say that if I be religious I would be very afraid of evolution I would go further I would fear science in general if properly understand and this be because the scientific worldview be so much more exciting more poetic more fill with sheer wonder than anything in the poverty stricken arsenal of the religious imagination as Carl Sagan another recently dead hero put it how be it that hardly any major religion have look at science and conclude this be good than we think the universe be much big than we prophet say grand more subtle more elegant instead they say no no no my god be a little god and I want he to stay that way a religion old or new that stress the magnificence of the universe as reveal by modern science might be able to draw forth reserve of reverence and awe hardly tap by the conventional faith now this be a elite audience and I would therefore expect about 10 percent of you to be religious many of you probably subscribe to we polite cultural belief that we should respect religion but I also suspect that a fair number of that secretly despise religion as much as I do laughter if you be one of they and of course many of you may not be but if you be one of they I be ask you to stop be polite come out and say so and if you happen to be rich give some thought to way in which you might make a difference the religious lobby in this country be massively finance by foundation to say nothing of all the tax benefit by foundation such as the Templeton Foundation and the Discovery Institute we need a anti Templeton to step forward if my book sell as well as Stephen Hawking book instead of only as well as Richard Dawkins book I would do it myself person be always go on about how do September the 11th change you well here be how it change I let all stop be so damned respectful thank you very much applause
