what I would like to talk about be really the big problem in the world I be not go to talk about the skeptical environmentalist probably that be also a good choice laughter but I be go talk about what be the big problem in the world and I must say before I go on I should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because I be actually go to ask you to help I to look at how we do that so get out you pen and paper bottom line be there be a lot of problem out there in the world I be just go to list some of they there be 800 million person starve there be a billion person without clean drinking water two billion person without sanitation there be several million person die of HIV and AIDS the list go on and on there be two billion of person who will be severely affect by climate change so on there be many many problem out there in a ideal world we would solve they all but we do not we do not actually solve all problem and if we do not the question I think we need to ask ourselves and that be why it be on the economy session be to say if we do not do all thing we really have to start ask ourselves which one should we solve first and that be the question I would like to ask you if we have say 50 billion dollar over the next four year to spend to do good in this world where should we spend it we identify 10 of the big challenge in the world and I will just briefly read they climate change communicable disease conflict education financial instability governance and corruption malnutrition and hunger population migration sanitation and water and subsidy and trade barrier we believe that this in many way encompass the big problem in the world the obvious question would be to ask what do you think be the big thing where should we start on solve this problem but that be a wrong problem to ask that be actually the problem that be ask in Davos in January but of course there be a problem in ask person to focus on problem because we can not solve problem surely the big problem we have in the world be that we all die but we do not have a technology to solve that right so the point be not to prioritize problem but the point be to prioritize solution to problem and that would be of course that get a little more complicated to climate change that would be like Kyoto to communicable disease it might be health clinic or mosquito net to conflict it would be U N peacekeeping force and so on the point that I would like to ask you to try to do be just in 30 second and I know this be in a sense a impossible task write down what you think be probably some of the top priority and also and that be of course where economics get evil to put down what be the thing we should not do first what should be at the bottom of the list please just take 30 second perhaps talk to you neighbor and just figure out what should be the top priority and the bottom priority of the solution that we have to the world big issue the amazing part of this process and of course I mean I would love to I only have 18 minute I have already give you quite a substantial amount of my time right I would love to go into and get you to think about this process and that be actually what we do and I also strongly encourage you and I be sure we will also have this discussion afterwards to think about how do we actually prioritize of course you have to ask yourself why on Earth be such a list never do before and one reason be that prioritization be incredibly uncomfortable nobody want to do this of course every organization would love to be on the top of such a list but every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list and since there be many more not number one spot on the list than there be number one it make perfect sense not to want to do such a list we have have the u n for almost 60 year yet we have never actually make a fundamental list of all the big thing that we can do in the world and say which of they should we do first so it do not mean that we be not prioritize any decision be a prioritization so of course we be still prioritize if only implicitly and that be unlikely to be as good as if we actually do the prioritization and go in and talk about it so what I be propose be really to say that we have for a very long time have a situation when we have have a menu of choice there be many many thing we can do out there but we have not have the price nor the size we have not have a idea imagine go into a restaurant and get this big menu card but you have no idea what the price be you know you have a pizza you have no idea what the price be it could be at one dollar it could be 1 000 dollar it could be a family size pizza it could be a very individual size pizza right we would like to know this thing and that be what the Copenhagen Consensus be really try to do to try to put price on this issue and so basically this have be the Copenhagen Consensus process we get 30 of the world good economist three in each area so we have three of world top economist write about climate change what can we do what will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that likewise in communicable disease three of the world top expert say what can we do what would be the price what should we do about it and what will be the outcome and so on then we have some of the world top economist eight of the world top economist include three Nobel Laureates meet in Copenhagen in May 2004 we call they the dream team the Cambridge University prefect decide to call they the Real Madrid of economics that work very well in Europe but it do not really work over here and what they basically do be come out with a prioritize list and then you ask why economist and of course I be very happy you ask that question laughter because that be a very good question the point be of course if you want to know about malaria you ask a malaria expert if you want to know about climate you ask a climatologist but if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first you can not ask either of they because that be not what they do that be what economist do they prioritize they make that in some way disgusting task of say which one should we do first and which one should we do afterwards so this be the list and this be the one I would like to share with you of course you can also see it on the website and we will also talk about it more I be sure as the day go on they basically come up with a list where they say there be bad project basically project where if you invest a dollar you get less than a dollar back then there be fair project good project and very good project and of course it be the very good project we should start do I be go to go from backwards so that we end up with the good project this be the bad project as you might see the bottom of the list be climate change this offend a lot of person and that be probably one of the thing where person will say I should not come back either and I would like to talk about that because that be really curious why be it it come up and I will actually also try to get back to this because it be probably one of the thing that we will disagree with on the list that you write down the reason why they come up with say that Kyoto or do something more than Kyoto be a bad deal be simply because it be very inefficient it be not say that global warming be not happen it be not say that it be not a big problem but it be say that what we can do about it be very little at a very high cost what they basically show we the average of all macroeconomic model be that Kyoto if everyone agree would cost about 150 billion dollar a year that be a substantial amount of money that be two to three time the global development aid that we give the Third World every year yet it would do very little good all model show it will postpone warm for about six year in 2100 so the guy in Bangladesh who get a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106 which be a little good but not very much good so the idea here really be to say well we have spend a lot of money do a little good and just to give you a sense of reference the U N actually estimate that for half that amount for about 75 billion dollar a year we could solve all major basic problem in the world we could give clean drinking water sanitation basic healthcare and education to every single human be on the planet so we have to ask ourselves do we want to spend twice the amount on do very little good or half the amount on do a amazing amount of good and that be really why it become a bad project it be not to say that if we have all the money in the world we would not want to do it but it be to say when we do not it be just simply not we first priority the fair project notice I be not go to comment on all this but communicable disease scale of basic health service just make it simply because yes scale of basic health service be a great thing it would do a lot of good but it be also very very costly again what it tell we be suddenly we start think about both side of the equation if you look at the good project a lot of sanitation and water project come in again sanitation and water be incredibly important but it also cost a lot of infrastructure so I would like to show you the top four priority which should be at least the first one that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problem in the world the fourth good problem be malaria deal with malaria the incidence of malaria be about a couple of million person get infect every year it might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP every year for affected nation if we invest about 13 billion dollar over the next four year we could bring that incidence down to half we could avoid about 500 000 person die but perhaps more importantly we could avoid about a million person get infect every year we would significantly increase they ability to deal with many of the other problem that they have to deal with of course in the long run also to deal with global warming this third good one be free trade basically the model show that if we could get free trade and especially cut subsidy in the U S and Europe we could basically enliven the global economy to a astounding number of about 2 400 billion dollar a year half of which would accrue to the Third World again the point be to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million person out of poverty very radically fast in about two to five year that would be the third good thing we could do the second good thing would be to focus on malnutrition not just malnutrition in general but there be a very cheap way of deal with malnutrition namely the lack of micronutrient basically about half of the world population be lack in iron zinc iodine and vitamin a if we invest about 12 billion dollar we could make a severe inroad into that problem that would be the second good investment that we could do and the very good project would be to focus on HIV AIDS basically if we invest 27 billion dollar over the next eight year we could avoid 28 new million case of HIV AIDS again what this do and what it focus on be say there be two very different way that we can deal with HIV AIDS one be treatment the other one be prevention and again in a ideal world we would do both but in a world where we do not do either or do not do it very well we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first and treatment be much much more expensive than prevention so basically what this focus on be say we can do a lot more by invest in prevention basically for the amount of money that we spend we can do x amount of good in treatment and 10 time as much good in prevention so again what we focus on be prevention rather than treatment at first rate what this really do be that it make we think about we priority I would like to have you look at you priority list and say do you get it right or do you get close to what we come up with here well of course one of the thing be climate change again I find a lot of person find it very very unlikely that we should do that we should also do climate change if for no other reason simply because it be such a big problem but of course we do not do all problem there be many problem out there in the world and what I want to make sure of be if we actually focus on problem that we focus on the right one the one where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good and I think actually Thomas Schelling one of the participant in the dream team he put it very very well one of thing that person forget be that in 100 year when we be talk about most of the climate change impact will be person will be much much rich even the most pessimistic impact scenario of the u n estimate that the average person in the develop world in 2100 will be about as rich as we be today much more likely they will be two to four time rich than we be and of course we will be even rich than that but the point be to say when we talk about save person or help person in Bangladesh in 2100 we be not talk about a poor Bangladeshi we be actually talk about a fairly rich dutch guy and so the real point of course be to say do we want to spend a lot of money help a little 100 year from now a fairly rich dutch guy or do we want to help real poor person right now in Bangladesh who really need the help and whom we can help very very cheaply or as Schelling put it imagine if you be a rich as you will be a rich Chinese a rich Bolivian a rich Congolese in 2100 think back on 2005 and say how odd that they care so much about help I a little bit through climate change and care so fairly little about help my grandfather and my great grandfather whom they could have help so much more and who need the help so much more so I think that really do tell we why it be we need to get we priority straight even if it do not accord to the typical way we see this problem of course that be mainly because climate change have good picture we have you know the day after tomorrow it look great right it be a good film in the sense that I certainly want to see it right but do not expect Emmerich to cast Brad Pitt in he next movie dig latrine in Tanzania or something laughter it just do not make for as much of a movie so in many way I think of the Copenhagen Consensus and the whole discussion of priority as a defense for boring problem to make sure that we realize it be not about make we feel good it be not about make thing that have the most media attention but it be about make place where we can actually do the most good the other objection I think that be important to say be that I be somehow or we be somehow posit a false choice of course we should do all thing in a ideal world I would certainly agree I think we should do all thing but we do not in 1970 the developed world decide we be go to spend twice as much as we do right now than in 1970 on the develop world since then we aid have halve so it do not look like we be actually on the path of suddenly solve all big problem likewise person be also say but what about the Iraq war you know we spend 100 billion dollar why do not we spend that on do good in the world I be all for that if any one of you guy can talk Bush into do that that be fine but the point of course be still to say if you get another 100 billion dollar we still want to spend that in the good possible way do not we so the real issue here be to get ourselves back and think about what be the right priority I should just mention briefly be this really the right list that we get out you know when you ask the world good economist you inevitably end up ask old white American man and they be not necessarily you know great way of look at the entire world so we actually invite 80 young person from all over the world to come and solve the same problem the only two requirement be that they be study at the university and they speak English the majority of they be first from develop country they have all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion and they certainly do to come up with they own list and the surprising thing be that the list be very similar with malnutrition and disease at the top and climate change at the bottom we have do this many other time there be be many other seminar and university student and different thing they all come out with very much the same list and that give I great hope really in say that I do believe that there be a path ahead to get we to start think about priority and say what be the important thing in the world of course in a ideal world again we would love to do everything but if we do not do it then we can start think about where should we start I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process we do it in 2004 and we hope to assemble many more person get much good information for 2008 2012 map out the right path for the world but also to start think about political triage to start think about say let do not the thing where we can do very little at a very high cost not the thing that we do not know how to do but let do the great thing where we can do a enormous amount of good at very low cost right now at the end of the day you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize this but we have to be honest and frank about say if there be some thing we do there be other thing we do not do if we worry too much about some thing we end by not worry about other thing so I hope this will help we make good priority and think about how we good work for the world thank you
