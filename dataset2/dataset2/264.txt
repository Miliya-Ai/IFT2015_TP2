I get my first computer when I be a teenager grow up in Accra and it be a really cool device you could play game with it you could program it in basic and I be fascinate so I go into the library to figure out how do this thing work I read about how the cpu be constantly shuffling datum back and forth between the memory the RAM and the ALU the arithmetic and logic unit and I think to myself this cpu really have to work like crazy just to keep all this datum move through the system but nobody be really worried about this when computer be first introduce they be say to be a million time fast than neuron person be really excited they think they would soon outstrip the capacity of the brain this be a quote actually from Alan Turing in 30 year it will be as easy to ask a computer a question as to ask a person this be in 1946 and now in 2007 it be still not true and so the question be why be not we really see this kind of power in computer that we see in the brain what person do not realize and I be just begin to realize right now be that we pay a huge price for the speed that we claim be a big advantage of this computer let take a look at some number this be blue gene the fast computer in the world it be get 120 000 processor they can basically process 10 quadrillion bit of information per second that be 10 to the sixteenth and they consume one and a half megawatt of power so that would be really great if you could add that to the production capacity in Tanzania it would really boost the economy just to go back to the States if you translate the amount of power or electricity this computer use to the amount of household in the States you get 1 200 household in the U S that be how much power this computer use now let compare this with the brain this be a picture of actually Rory Sayres girlfriend brain Rory be a graduate student at Stanford he study the brain use mri and he claim that this be the most beautiful brain that he have ever scan laughter so that be true love right there now how much computation do the brain do I estimate 10 to the 16 bit per second which be actually about very similar to what Blue Gene do so that be the question the question be how much they be do a similar amount of processing similar amount of datum the question be how much energy or electricity do the brain use and it be actually as much as you laptop computer it be just 10 watt so what we be do right now with computer with the energy consume by 1 200 house the brain be do with the energy consume by you laptop so the question be how be the brain able to achieve this kind of efficiency and let I just summarize so the bottom line the brain process information use 100 000 time less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have how be the brain able to do this let just take a look about how the brain work and then I will compare that with how computer work so this clip be from the pbs series the Secret Life of the brain it show you this cell that process information they be call neuron they send little pulse of electricity down they process to each other and where they contact each other that little pulse of electricity can jump from one neuron to the other that process be call a synapse you have get this huge network of cell interact with each other about 100 million of they send about 10 quadrillion of this pulse around every second and that be basically what be go on in you brain right now as you be watch this how do that compare with the way computer work in the computer you have all the datum go through the central processing unit and any piece of datum basically have to go through that bottleneck whereas in the brain what you have be this neuron and the datum just really flow through a network of connection among the neuron there be no bottleneck here it be really a network in the literal sense of the word the net be do the work in the brain if you just look at this two picture this kind of word pop into you mind this be serial and it be rigid it be like car on a freeway everything have to happen in lockstep whereas this be parallel and it be fluid information processing be very dynamic and adaptive so I be not the first to figure this out this be a quote from Brian Eno the problem with computer be that there be not enough Africa in they laughter Brian actually say this in 1995 and nobody be listen then but now person be begin to listen because there be a press technological problem that we face and I will just take you through that a little bit in the next few slide this be it be actually really this remarkable convergence between the device that we use to compute in computer and the device that we brain use to compute the device that computer use be what be call a transistor this electrode here call the gate control the flow of current from the source to the drain this two electrode and that current electrical current be carry by electron just like in you house and so on and what you have here be when you actually turn on the gate you get a increase in the amount of current and you get a steady flow of current and when you turn off the gate there be no current flow through the device you computer use this presence of current to represent a one and the absence of current to represent a zero now what be happen be that as transistor be get small and small and small they no long behave like this in fact they be start to behave like the device that neuron use to compute which be call a ion channel and this be a little protein molecule I mean neuron have thousand of this and it sit in the membrane of the cell and it be get a pore in it and this be individual potassium ion that be flow through that pore now this pore can open and close but when it be open because this ion have to line up and flow through one at a time you get a kind of sporadic not steady it be a sporadic flow of current and even when you close the pore which neuron can do they can open and close this pore to generate electrical activity even when it be close because this ion be so small they can actually sneak through a few can sneak through at a time so what you have be that when the pore be open you get some current sometimes this be you one but you have get a few zero throw in and when it be close you have a zero but you have a few one throw in now this be start to happen in transistor and the reason why that be happen be that right now in 2007 the technology that we be use a transistor be big enough that several electron can flow through the channel simultaneously side by side in fact there be about 12 electron can all be flow this way and that mean that a transistor correspond to about 12 ion channel in parallel now in a few year time by 2015 we will shrink transistor so much this be what Intel do to keep add more core onto the chip or you memory stick that you have now can carry one gigabyte of stuff on they before it be 256 transistor be get small to allow this to happen and technology have really benefit from that but what be happen now be that in 2015 the transistor be go to become so small that it correspond to only one electron at a time can flow through that channel and that correspond to a single ion channel and you start have the same kind of traffic jam that you have in the ion channel the current will turn on and off at random even when it be suppose to be on and that mean you computer be go to get its one and zero mix up and that be go to crash you machine so we be at the stage where we do not really know how to compute with this kind of device and the only kind of thing the only thing we know right now that can compute with this kind of device be the brain ok so a computer pick a specific item of datum from memory it send it into the processor or the ALU and then it put the result back into memory that be the red path that be highlight the way brain work I tell you all you have get all this neuron and the way they represent information be they break up that datum into little piece that be represent by pulse and different neuron so you have all this piece of datum distribute throughout the network and then the way that you process that datum to get a result be that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity just by it flow through the network so you set up this connection such that the input pattern just flow and generate the output pattern what you see here be that there be this redundant connection so if this piece of datum or this piece of the datum get clobber it do not show up over here this two piece can activate the missing part with this redundant connection so even when you go to this crappy device where sometimes you want a one and you get a zero and it do not show up there be redundancy in the network that can actually recover the missing information it make the brain inherently robust what you have here be a system where you store datum locally and it be brittle because each of this step have to be flawless otherwise you lose that datum whereas in the brain you have a system that store datum in a distribute way and it be robust what I want to basically talk about be my dream which be to build a computer that work like the brain this be something that we have be work on for the last couple of year and I be go to show you a system that we design to model the retina which be a piece of brain that line the inside of you eyeball we do not do this by actually write code like you do in a computer in fact the processing that happen in that little piece of brain be very similar to the kind of processing that computer do when they stream video over the internet they want to compress the information they just want to send the change what be new in the image and so on and that be how you eyeball be able to squeeze all that information down to you optic nerve to send to the rest of the brain instead of do this in software or do that kind of algorithm we go and talk to neurobiologist who have actually reverse engineer that piece of brain that be call the retina and they figure out all the different cell and they figure out the network and we just take that network and we use it as the blueprint for the design of a silicon chip so now the neuron be represent by little node or circuit on the chip and the connection among the neuron be represent actually model by transistor and this transistor be behave essentially just like ion channel behave in the brain it will give you the same kind of robust architecture that I describe here be actually what we artificial eye look like the retina chip that we design sit behind this lens here and the chip I be go to show you a video that the silicon retina put out of its output when it be look at Kareem Zaghloul who be the student who design this chip let I explain what you be go to see ok because it be put out different kind of information it be not as straightforward as a camera the retina chip extract four different kind of information it extract region with dark contrast which will show up on the video as red and it extract region with white or light contrast which will show up on the video as green this be Kareem dark eye and that be the white background that you see here and then it also extract movement when Kareem move he head to the right you will see this blue activity there it represent region where the contrast be increase in the image that be where it be go from dark to light and you also see this yellow activity which represent region where contrast be decrease it be go from light to dark and this four type of information you optic nerve have about a million fiber in it and 900 000 of that fiber send this four type of information so we be really duplicate the kind of signal that you have on the optic nerve what you notice here be that this snapshot take from the output of the retina chip be very sparse right it do not light up green everywhere in the background only on the edge and then in the hair and so on and this be the same thing you see when person compress video to send they want to make it very sparse because that file be small and this be what the retina be do and it be do it just with the circuitry and how this network of neuron that be interact in there which we have capture on the chip but the point that I want to make I will show you up here so this image here be go to look like this one but here I will show you that we can reconstruct the image so you know you can almost recognize Kareem in that top part there and so here you go yes so that be the idea when you stand still you just see the light and dark contrast but when it be move back and forth the retina pick up this change and that be why you know when you be sit here and something happen in you background you merely move you eye to it there be this cell that detect change and you move you attention to it so that be very important for catch somebody who be try to sneak up on you let I just end by say that this be what happen when you put Africa in a piano ok this be a steel drum here that have be modify and that be what happen when you put Africa in a piano and what I would like we to do be put Africa in the computer and come up with a new kind of computer that will generate think imagination be creative and thing like that thank you applause Chris Anderson question for you Kwabena do you put together in you mind the work you be do the future of Africa this conference what connection can we make if any between they Kwabena Boahen yes like I say at the beginning I get my first computer when I be a teenager grow up in Accra and I have this gut reaction that this be the wrong way to do it it be very brute force it be very inelegant I do not think that I would have have that reaction if I have grow up read all this science fiction hearing about rd2d2 whatever it be call and just you know buy into this hype about computer I be come at it from a different perspective where I be bring that different perspective to bear on the problem and I think a lot of person in Africa have this different perspective and I think that be go to impact technology and that be go to impact how it be go to evolve and I think you be go to be able to see use that infusion to come up with new thing because you be come from a different perspective I think we can contribute we can dream like everybody else can thanks Kwabena that be really interesting thank you applause
