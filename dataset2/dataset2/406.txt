I coin my own definition of success in 1934 when I be teach at a high school in South Bend Indiana be a little bit disappointed and disillusioned perhaps by the way parent of the youngster in my English class expect they youngster to get a a or a b they think a c be all right for the neighbor child because they be all average but they be not satisfied when they own it would make the teacher feel that they have fail or the youngster have fail and that be not right the good Lord in he infinite wisdom do not create we all equal as far as intelligence be concern any more than we be equal for size appearance not everybody could earn a a or a b and I do not like that way of judging and I do know how the alumnus of various school back in the 30 judge coach and athletic team if you win they all you be consider to be reasonably successful not completely because I find out we have a number of year at UCLA where we do not lose a game but it seem that we do not win each individual game by the margin that some of we alumnus have predict laughter and quite frequently I really feel that they have back up they prediction in a more materialistic manner laughter but that be true back in the 30 so I understand that but I do not like it I do not agree with it I want to come up with something I hope could make I a good teacher and give the youngster under my supervision be it in athletics or the English classroom something to which to aspire other than just a high mark in the classroom or more point in some athletic contest I think about that for quite a spell and I want to come up with my own definition I think that might help and I know how Mr Webster define it as the accumulation of material possession or the attainment of a position of power or prestige or something of that sort worthy accomplishment perhaps but in my opinion not necessarily indicative of success so I want to come up with something of my own and I recall I be raise on a small farm in Southern Indiana and Dad try to teach I and my brother that you should never try to be good than someone else I be sure at the time he do that I do not it do not well somewhere I guess in the hidden recess of the mind it pop out year late never try to be good than someone else always learn from other never cease try to be the good you can be that be under you control if you get too engrossed and involved and concerned in regard to the thing over which you have no control it will adversely affect the thing over which you have control then I run across this simple verse that say at God footstool to confess a poor soul kneel and bow he head I fail he cry the Master say thou do thy good that be success from that thing and one other perhaps I coin my own definition of success which be peace of mind attain only through self satisfaction in know you make the effort to do the good of which you be capable I believe that be true if you make the effort to do the good of which you be capable try to improve the situation that exist for you I think that be success and I do not think other can judge that it be like character and reputation you reputation be what you be perceive to be you character be what you really be and I think that character be much more important than what you be perceive to be you would hope they would both be good but they will not necessarily be the same well that be my idea that I be go to try to get across to the youngster I run across other thing I love to teach and it be mention by the previous speaker that I enjoy poetry and I dabble in it a bit and love it there be some thing that help I I think be good than I would have be I know I be not what I ought to be what I should be but I think I be good than I would have be if I have not run across certain thing one be just a little verse that say no write word no speak plea can teach we youth what they should be nor all the book on all the shelf it be what the teacher be themselves that make a impression on I in the 1930 and I try to use that more or less in my teaching whether it be in sport or whether it be in the English classroom I love poetry and always have a interest in that somehow maybe it be because Dad use to read to we at night by coal oil lamp we do not have electricity in we farm home and Dad would read poetry to we so I always like it and about the same time I run across this one verse I run across another one someone ask a lady teacher why she teach and after some time she say she want to think about that then she come up and say they ask I why I teach and I reply where could I find such splendid company there sit a statesman strong unbiased wise another Daniel Webster silver tongue a doctor sit beside he whose quick steady hand may mend a bone or stem the life blood flow and there a builder upward rise the arch of a church he build wherein that minister may speak the word of God and lead a stumbling soul to touch the Christ and all about a gathering of teacher farmer merchant laborer that who work and vote and build and plan and pray into a great tomorrow and I may say I may not see the church or hear the word or eat the food they hand may grow but yet again I may and later I may say I know he once and he be weak or strong or bold or proud or gay I know he once but then he be a boy they ask I why I teach and I reply where could I find such splendid company and I believe the teaching profession it be true you have so many youngster and I have get to think of my youngster at UCLA 30 some attorney 11 dentist and doctor many many teacher and other profession and that give you a great deal of pleasure to see they go on I always try to make the youngster feel that they be there to get a education number one basketball be second because it be pay they way and they do need a little time for social activity but you let social activity take a little precedence over the other two and you be not go to have any very long so that be the idea that I try to get across to the youngster under my supervision I have three rule pretty much that I stick with practically all the time I have learn this prior to come to UCLA and I decide they be very important one be never be late later on I say certain thing the player if we be leave for somewhere have to be neat and clean there be a time when I make they wear jacket and shirt and tie then I see we chancellor come to school in denims and turtleneck and think it be not right for I to keep this other rule so I let they just they have to be neat and clean I have one of my great player that you probably hear of Bill Walton he come to catch the bus we be leave for somewhere to play and he be not clean and neat so I would not let he go he could not get on the bus he have to go home and get clean up to get to the airport so I be a stickler for that I believe in that I believe in time very important I believe you should be on time but I feel at practice for example we start on time we close on time the youngster do not have to feel that we be go to keep they over when I speak at coach clinic I often tell young coach and at coach clinic more or less they will be the young coach get in the profession most of they be young you know and probably newly marry and I tell they do not run practice late because you will go home in a bad mood and that be not good for a young married man to go home in a bad mood when you get old it do not make any difference but laughter so I do believe on time I believe start on time and I believe close on time and another one I have be not one word of profanity one word of profanity and you be out of here for the day if I see it in a game you be go to come out and sit on the bench and the third one be never criticize a teammate I do not want that I use to tell they I be pay to do that that be my job I be pay to do it pitifully poor but I be pay to do it not like the coach today for gracious sake no it be a little different than it be in my day that be three thing that I stick with pretty closely all the time and that actually come from my dad that be what he try to teach I and my brother at one time I come up with a pyramid eventually that I do not have the time to go on that but that help I I think become a good teacher it be something like this and I have block in the pyramid and the cornerstone be industriousness and enthusiasm work hard and enjoy what you be do come up to the apex accord to my definition of success and right at the top faith and patience and I say to you in whatever you be do you must be patient you have to have patience to we want thing to happen we talk about we youth be impatient a lot and they be they want to change everything they think all change be progress and we get a little old we sort of let thing go and we forget there be no progress without change so you must have patience and I believe that we must have faith I believe that we must believe truly believe not just give it word service believe that thing will work out as they should provide we do what we should I think we tendency be to hope thing will turn out the way we want they to much of the time but we do not do the thing that be necessary to make that thing become reality I work on this for some 14 year and I think it help I become a good teacher but it all revolve around that original definition of success you know a number of year ago there be a Major League Baseball umpire by the name of George Moriarty he spell Moriarty with only one I I have never see that before but he do big league baseball player they be very perceptive about that thing and they notice he have only one I in he name you would be surprised how many also tell he that that be one more than he have in he head at various time laughter but he write something where I think he do what I try to do in this pyramid he call it the Road ahead or the Road behind he say sometimes I think the Fates must grin as we denounce they and insist the only reason we can not win be the fate themselves have miss yet there live on the ancient claim we win or lose within ourselves the shine trophy on we shelf can never win tomorrow game you and I know deep down there be always a chance to win the crown but when we fail to give we good we simply have not meet the test of give all and save none until the game be really win of show what be mean by grit of play through when other quit of play through not let up it be bear down that win the cup of dream there be a goal ahead of hope when we dream be dead of pray when we hope have flee yet lose not afraid to fall if bravely we have give all for who can ask more of a man than give all within he span give all it seem to I be not so far from victory and so the fate be seldom wrong no matter how they twist and wind it be you and I who make we fate we open up or close the gate on the road ahead or the road behind remind I of another set of three that my dad try to get across to we do not whine do not complain do not make excuse just get out there and whatever you be do do it to the good of you ability and no one can do more than that I try to get across too that my opponent will tell you you never hear I mention win never mention win my idea be that you can lose when you outscore somebody in a game and you can win when you be outscore I have feel that way on certain occasion at various time and I just want they to be able to hold they head up after a game I use to say that when a game be over and you see somebody that do not know the outcome I hope they could not tell by you action whether you outscore a opponent or the opponent outscore you that be what really matter if you make a effort to do the good you can regularly the result will be about what they should be not necessarily what you have want they to be but they will be about what they should only you will know whether you can do that and that be what I want from they more than anything else and as time go by and I learn more about other thing I think it work a little good as far as the result but I want the score of a game to be the byproduct of this other thing and not the end itself I believe it be one great philosopher who say no no Cervantes Cervantes say the journey be good than the end and I like that I think that it be it be get there sometimes when you get there there be almost a let down but it be the get there that be the fun as a basketball coach at UCLA I like we practice to be the journey and the game would be the end the end result I like to go up and sit in the stand and watch the player play and see whether I have do a decent job during the week there again it be get the player to get that self satisfaction in know that they have make the effort to do the good of which they be capable sometimes I be ask who be the good player I have or the good team I can never answer that as far as the individual be concern I be ask one time about that and they say suppose that you in some way could make the perfect player what would you want and I say well I would want one that know why he be at UCLA to get a education he be a good student really know why he be there in the first place but I would want one that could play too I have want one to realize that defense usually win championship and who would work hard on defense but I would want one who would play offense too I have want he to be unselfish and look for the pass first and not shoot all the time and I would want one that could pass and would pass laughter I have have some that could and would not and I have have some that would and could laughter so yeah I would want that and I want they to be able to shoot from the outside I want they to be good inside too laughter I have want they to be able to rebind well at both end too why not just take someone like Keith Wilkes and let it go at that he have the qualification not the only one but he be one that I use in that particular category because I think he make the effort to become the good there be a couple I mention in my book they call I Coach two player that give I great satisfaction that come as close as I think anyone I ever have to reach they full potential one be Conrad Burke and one be Doug McIntosh when I see they as freshman on we freshman team freshman could not play varsity when I teach I think oh gracious if this two player either one of they they be different year but I think about each one at the time he be there oh if he ever make the varsity we varsity must be pretty miserable if he be good enough to make it and you know one of they be a start player for a season and a half the other one he next year play 32 minute in a national championship game do a tremendous job for we the next year he be a start player on the national championship team and here I think he would never play a minute when he be so that be the thing that give you great joy and great satisfaction to see neither one of that youngster could shoot very well but they have outstanding shooting percentage because they do not force it and neither one could jump very well but they keep good position and so they do well rebind they remember that every shot that be take they assume would be miss I have have too many stand around and wait to see if it be miss then they go and it be too late somebody else be in there ahead of they they be not very quick but they play good position keep in good balance and so they play pretty good defense for we so they have quality that they come close to as close to reach possibly they full potential as any player I ever have so I consider they to be as successful as Lewis Alcindor or Bill Walton or many of the other that we have there be some outstanding player have I ramble enough I be tell that when he make he appearance I be suppose to shut up laughter applause
