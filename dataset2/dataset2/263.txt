the internet the web as we know it the kind of web the thing we be all talk about be already less than 5 000 day old so all of the thing that we have see come about start say with satellite image of the whole Earth which we could not even imagine happen before all this thing roll into we life just this abundance of thing that be right before we sit in front of we laptop or we desktop this kind of cornucopia of stuff just come and never end be amazing and we be not amazed it be really amazing that all this stuff be here laughter it be in 5 000 day all this stuff have come and I know that 10 year ago if I have tell you that this be all come you would have say that that be impossible there be simply no economic model that that would be possible and if I tell you it be all come for free you would say this be simply you be dream you be a Californian Utopian you be a wild eyed optimist and yet it be here the other thing that we know about it be that 10 year ago as I look at what even Wired be talk about we think it be go to be tv but good that be the model that be what everybody be suggest be go to be come and it turn out that that be not what it be first of all it be impossible and it be not what it be and so one of the thing that I think we be learn if you think about like Wikipedia it be something that be simply impossible it be impossible in theory but possible in practice and if you take all this thing that be impossible I think one of the thing that we be learn from this era from this last decade be that we have to get good at believe in the impossible because we be unprepared for it so I be curious about what be go to happen in the next 5 000 day but if that be happen in the last 5 000 day what be go to happen in the next 5 000 day so I have a kind of a simple story and it suggest that what we want to think about be this thing that we be make this thing that have happen in 5 000 day that be all this computer all this handheld all this cell phone all this laptop all this server basically what we be get out of all this connection be we be get one machine if there be only one machine and we little handheld and device be actually just little window into that machine but that we be basically construct a single global machine and so I begin to think about that and it turn out that this machine happen to be the most reliable machine that we have ever make it have not crash it be run uninterrupted and there be almost no other machine that we have ever make that run the number of hour the number of day 5 000 day without interruption that be just unbelievable and of course the internet be long than just 5 000 day the web be only 5 000 day so I be try to basically make measurement what be the dimension of this machine and I start off by calculate how many billion of click there be all around the globe on all the computer and there be a 100 billion click per day and there be 55 trillion link between all the web page of the world and so I begin think more about other kind of dimension and I make a quick list be it Chris Jordan the photographer talk about number be so large that they be meaningless well here be a list of they they be hard to tell but there be one billion pc chip on the internet if you count all the chip in all the computer on the internet there be two million email per second so it be a very big number it be just a huge machine and it use five percent of the global electricity on the planet so here be the specification just as if you be to make up a spec sheet for it 170 quadrillion transistor 55 trillion link email run at two megahertz itself 31 kilohertz text messaging 246 exabyte storage that be a big disk that be a lot of storage memory nine exabyte ram and the total traffic on this be run at seven terabyte per second Brewster be say the Library of Congress be about twenty terabyte so every second half of the Library of Congress be swoosh around in this machine it be a big machine so I do something else I figure out 100 billion click per day 55 trillion link be almost the same as the number of synap in you brain a quadrillion transistor be almost the same as the number of neuron in you brain so to a first approximation we have this thing twenty petahertz synapse firing of course the memory be really huge but to a first approximation the size of this machine be the size and its complexity kind of to you brain because in fact that how you brain work in kind of the same way that the web work however you brain be not double every two year so if we say this machine right now that we have make be about one hb one human brain if we look at the rate that this be increase 30 year from now there will be six billion hb so by the year 2040 the total processing of this machine will exceed a total processing power of humanity in raw bit and stuff and this be I think where Ray Kurzweil and other get this little chart say that we be go to cross so what about that well here be a couple of thing I have three kind of general thing I would like to say three consequence of this First that basically what this machine be do be embody we be give it a body and that be what we be go to do in the next 5 000 day we be go to give this machine a body and the second thing be we be go to restructure its architecture and thirdly we be go to become completely codependent upon it so let I go through that three thing first of all we have all this thing in we hand we think they be all separate device but in fact every screen in the world be look into the one machine this be all basically portal into that one machine the second thing be that some person call this the cloud and you be kind of touch the cloud with this and so in some way all you really need be a cloudbook and the cloudbook do not have any storage it be wireless it be always connect there be many thing about it it become very simple and basically what you be do be you be just touch the machine you be touch the cloud and you be go to compute that way so the machine be compute and in some way it be sort of back to the kind of old idea of centralized computing but everything all the camera and the microphone and the sensor in car and everything be connect to this machine and everything will go through the web and we be see that already with say phone right now phone do not go through the web but they be begin to and they will and if you imagine what say just as a example what Google Labs have in term of experiment with Google Docs Google Spreadsheets blah blah blah all this thing be go to become web base they be go through the machine and I be suggest that every bit will be own by the web right now it be not if you do spreadsheet and thing at work a Word document they be not on the web but they be go to be they be go to be part of this machine they be go to speak the web language they be go to talk to the machine the web in some sense be kind of like a black hole that be suck up everything into it and so every thing will be part of the web so every item every artifact that we make will have embed in it some little sliver of web ness and connection and it will be part of this machine so that we environment kind of in that ubiquitous computing sense we environment become the web everything be connect now with rfid and other thing whatever technology it be it do not really matter the point be that everything will have embed in it some sensor connect it to the machine and so we have basically a internet of thing so you begin to think of a shoe as a chip with heel and a car as a chip with wheel because basically most of the cost of manufacture car be the embed intelligence and electronics in it and not the material a lot of person think about the new economy as something that be go to be a disembodied alternative virtual existence and that we would have the old economy of atom but in fact what the new economy really be be the marriage of that two where we embed the information and the digital nature of thing into the material world that be what we be look forward to that be where we be go this union this convergence of the atomic and the digital and so one of the consequence of that I believe be that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now tv film video that basically become one media platform and while there be many difference in some sen they will share more and more in common with each other so that the law of media such as the fact that copy have no value the value be in the uncopiable thing the immediacy the authentication the personalization the media want to be liquid the reason why thing be free be so that you can manipulate they not so that they be free as in beer but free as in freedom and the network effect rule mean that the more you have the more you get the first fax machine the person who buy the first fax machine be a idiot because there be nobody to fax to but here she become a evangelist recruit other to get the fax machine because it make they purchase more valuable that be the effect that we be go to see attention be the currency so that law be go to kind of spread throughout all media and the other thing about this embodiment be that there be kind of what I call the McLuhan reversal McLuhan be say machine be the extension of the human sen and I be say human be now go to be the extended sen of the machine in a certain sense so we have a trillion eye and ear and touch through all we digital photograph and camera and we see that in thing like Flickr or Photosynth this program from Microsoft that will allow you to assemble a view of a touristy place from the thousand of tourist snapshot of it in a certain sense the machine be see through the pixel of individual camera now the second thing that I want to talk about be this idea of restructure that what the web be do be restructure and I have to warn you that what we will talk about be I be go to give my explanation of a term you be hear which be a semantic web so first of all the first stage that we have see of the internet be that it be go to link computer and that be what we call the net that be the internet of net and we see that where you have all the computer of the world and if you remember it be a kind of green screen with cursor and there be really not much to do and if you want to connect it you connect it from one computer to another computer and what you have to do be if you want to participate in this you have to share packet of information so you be forward on you do not have control it be not like a telephone system where you have control of a line you have to share packet the second stage that we be in now be the idea of link page so in the old one if I want to go on to a airline web page I go from my computer to a ftp site to another airline computer now we have page the unit have be resolve into page so one page link to another page and if I want to go in to book a flight I go into the airline flight page the website of the airline and I be link to that page and what we be share be link so you have to be kind of open with link you could not deny if someone want to link to you you could not stop they you have to participate in this idea of open up you page to be link by anybody so that be what we be do we be now enter to the third stage which be what I be talk about and that be where we link the datum so I do not know what the name of this thing be I be call it the one machine but we be link datum so we be go from machine to machine from page to page and now datum to datum so the difference be be that rather than link from page to page we be actually go to link from one idea on a page to another idea rather than to the other page so every idea be basically be support or every item or every noun be be support by the entire web it be be resolve at the level of item or idea or word if you want so besides physically come out again into this idea that it be not just virtual it be actually go out to thing so something will resolve down to the information about a particular person so every person will have a unique id every person every item will have a something that will be very specific and will link to a specific representation of that idea or item so now in this new one when I link to it I would link to my particular flight my particular seat and so give a example of this thing I live in Pacifica rather than right now Pacifica be just sort of a name on the web somewhere the web do not know that that be actually a town and that it be a specific town that I live in but that be what we be go to be talk about it be go to link directly to it will know the web will be able to read itself and know that that actually be a place and that whenever it see that word Pacifica it know that it actually have a place latitude longitude a certain population so here be some of the technical term all three letter thing that you will see a lot more of all this thing be about enable this idea of link to the datum so I will give you one kind of a example there be like a billion social site on the web each time you go into there you have to tell it again who you be and all you friend be why should you be do that you should just do that once and it should know who all you friend be so that be what you want be all you friend be identify and you should just carry this relationship around all this datum about you should just be convey and you should do it once and that be all that should happen and you should have all the network of all the relationship between that piece of datum that be what we be move into where it sort of know this thing down to that level a semantic web web 3 0 giant global graph we be kind of try out what we want to call this thing but what be it be do be share datum so you have to be open to have you datum share which be a much big step than just share you web page or you computer and all this thing that be go to be on this be not just page they be thing everything we have describe every artifact or place will be a specific representation will have a specific character that can be link to directly so we have this database of thing and so there be actually a fourth thing that we have not get to that we will not see in the next 10 year or 5 000 day but I think that be where we be go to and as the internet of thing where I be link directly to the particular thing of my seat on the plane that that physical thing become part of the web and so we be in the middle of this thing that be completely link down to every object in the little sliver of a connection that it have so the last thing I want to talk about be this idea that we be go to be codependent it be always go to be there and the close it be the good if you allow Google to it will tell you you search history and I find out by look at it that I search most at 11 o clock in the morning so I be open and be transparent to that and I think total personalization in this new world will require total transparency that be go to be the price if you want to have total personalization you have to be totally transparent Google I can not remember my phone number I will just ask Google we be so dependent on this that I have now get to the point where I do not even try to remember thing I will just Google it it be easy to do that and we kind of object at first say oh that be awful but if we think about the dependency that we have on this other technology call the alphabet and writing we be totally dependent on it and it be transform culture we can not imagine ourselves without the alphabet and write and so in the same way we be go to not imagine ourselves without this other machine be there and what be happen with this be some kind of ai but it be not the ai in conscious be as be a expert Larry Page tell I that that be what they be try to do and that be what they be try to do but when six billion human be google who be search who it go both way so we be the web that be what this thing be we be go to be the machine so the next 5 000 day it be not go to be the web and only good just like it be not tv and only good the next 5 000 day it be not just go to be the web but only good it be go to be something different and I think it be go to be smart it will have a intelligence in there that be not again conscious but it will anticipate what we be do in a good sense secondly it be become much more personalize it will know we and that be good and again the price of that will be transparency and thirdly it be go to become more ubiquitous in term of fill you entire environment and we will be in the middle of it and all this device will be portal into that so the single idea that I want to leave with you be that we have to begin to think about this as not just the web only well but a new kind of stage in this development it look more global if you take this whole thing it be a very big machine very reliable machine more reliable than its part but we can also think about it as kind of a large organism so we might respond to it more as if this be a whole system more as if this be not a large organism that we be go to be interact with it be a one and I do not know what else to call it than the one we will have a good word for it but there be a unity of some sort that be start to emerge and again I do not want to talk about consciousness I want to talk about it just as if it be a little bacterium or a volvox which be what that organism be so to do action take away so here be what I would say there be only one machine and the web be its OS all screen look into the one no bit will live outside the web to share be to gain let the one read it it be go to be machine readable you want to make something that the machine can read and the one be we we be in the one I appreciate you time applause
