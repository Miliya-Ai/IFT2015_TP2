my name be Ursus Wehrli and I would like to talk to you this morning about my project tidy up Art First of all any question so far first of all I have to say I be not from around here I be from a completely different cultural area maybe you notice I mean I be wear a tie first and then secondly I be a little bit nervous because I be speak in a foreign language and I want to apologize in advance for any mistake I might make because I be from Switzerland and I just do not hope you think this be Swiss German I be speak now here this be just what it sound like if we Swiss try to speak American but do not worry I do not have trouble with English as such I mean it be not my problem it be you language after all laughter I be fine after this presentation here at TED I can simply go back to Switzerland and you have to go on talk like this all the time laughter so I have be ask by the organizer to read from my book it be call tidy up art and it be as you can see it be more or less a picture book so the reading would be over very quickly but since I be here at TED I decide to hold my talk here in a more modern way in the spirit of TED here and I manage to do some slide here for you I would like to show they around so we can just you know laughter actually I manage to prepare for you some enlarge picture even well so tidy up art I mean I have to say that be a relatively new term you will not be familiar with it I mean it be a hobby of mine that I have be indulge in for the last few year and it all start out with this picture of the American artist Donald Baechler I have hang at home I have to look at it every day and after a while I just could not stand the mess anymore this guy be look at all day long yeah I kind of feel sorry for he and it seem to I even he feel really bad face this unorganized red square day after day so I decide to give he a little support and bring some order into neatly stack the block on top of each other laughter yeah and I think he look now less miserable and it be great with this experience I start to look more closely at modern art then I realize how you know the world of modern art be particularly topsy turvy and I can show here a very good example it be actually a simple one but it be a good one to start with it be a picture by Paul Klee and we can see here very clearly it be a confusion of color laughter yeah the artist do not really seem to know where to put the different color the various picture here of the various element of the picture the whole thing be unstructured we do not know maybe Mr Klee be probably in a hurry I mean laughter maybe he have to catch a plane or something we can see here he start out with orange and then he already run out of orange and here we can see he decide to take a break for a square and I would like to show you here my tidy up version of this picture laughter we can see now what be barely recognizable in the original 17 red and orange square be juxtapose with just two green square yeah that be great so I mean that be just tidy up for beginner I would like to show you here a picture which be a bit more advanced laughter what can you say what a mess I mean you see everything seem to have be scatter aimlessly around the space if my room back home have look like this my mother would have ground I for three day so I would like to I want to reintroduce some structure into that picture and that be really advanced tidy up applause yeah you be right sometimes person clap at this point but that be actually more in Switzerland laughter we Swiss be famous for chocolate and cheese we train run on time we be only happy when thing be in order but to go on here be a very good example to see this be a picture by Joan Miro and yeah we can see the artist have draw a few line and shape and drop they any old way onto a yellow background and yeah it be the sort of thing you produce when you be doodle on the phone laughter and this be my laughter you can see now the whole thing take up far less space it be more economical and also more efficient with this method Mr Miro could have save canvas for another picture but I can see in you face that you be still a little bit skeptical so that you can just appreciate how serious I be about all this I bring along the patent the specification for some of this work because I have have my working method patent at the Eidgen ssische amt f be Geistiges Eigentum in Bern Switzerland laughter I will just quote from the specification laut den Kunstpr fer Dr Albrecht it be not finish yet laut den Kunstpr fer Dr Albrecht G tz von Ohlenhusen wird die Verfahrensweise rechtlich gesch tzt welche die Kunst durch spezifisch aufger umte Regelm ssigkeiten des allgemeinen Formenschatzes neue Wirkungen zu erzielen m glich wird Ja well I could have translate that but you would have be none the wise I be not sure myself what it mean but it sound good anyway I just realize it be important how one introduce new idea to person that be why this patent be sometimes necessary I would like to do a short test with you everyone be sit in quite a orderly fashion here this morning so I would like to ask you all to raise you right hand yeah the right hand be the one we write with apart from the left hander and now I will count to three I mean it still look very orderly to I now I will count to three and on the count of three I would like you all to shake hand with the person behind you ok one two three laughter you can see now that be a good example even behave in a orderly systematic way can sometimes lead to complete chaos so we can also see that very clearly in this next painting this be a painting by the artist Niki de Saint Phalle and I mean in the original it be completely unclear to see what this tangle of color and shape be suppose to depict but in the tidy up version it be plain to see that it be a sunburnt woman play volleyball laughter yeah it be a this one here that be much good that be a picture by Keith Haring laughter I think it do not matter so I mean this picture have not even get a proper title it be call untitled and I think that be appropriate so in the tidy up version we have a sort of Keith Haring spare part shop laughter this be Keith Haring look at statistically one can see here quite clearly you can see we have 25 pale green element of which one be in the form of a circle or here for example we have 27 pink square with only one pink curve I mean that be interesting one could extend this sort of statistical analysis to cover all Mr Haring various work in order to establish in which period the artist favor pale green circle or pink square and the artist himself could also benefit from this sort of list procedure by use it to estimate how many pot of paint he be likely to need in the future laughter one can obviously also make combination for example with the Keith Haring circle and Kandinsky dot you can add they to all the square of Paul Klee in the end one have a list with which one then can arrange then you categorize it then you file it put that file in a filing cabinet put it in you office and you can make a living do it laughter yeah from my own experience so I be laughter actually I mean here we have some artist that be a bit more structured it be not too bad this be Jasper Johns we can see here he be practice with he ruler laughter but I think it could still benefit from more discipline and I think the whole thing add up much good if you do it like this laughter and here that be one of my favorite tidy up Rene Magritte this be really fun you know there be a laughter I be always be ask what inspire I to embark on all this it go back to a time when I be very often stay in hotel so once I have the opportunity to stay in a ritzy five star hotel and you know there you have this little sign I put this little sign outside the door every morning that read please tidy room I do not know if you have they over here so actually my room there have not be tidy once daily but three time a day so after a while I decide to have a little fun and before leave the room each day I would scatter a few thing around the space like book clothes toothbrush etc and it be great by the time I return everything have always be neatly return to its place but then one morning I hang the same little sign onto that picture by Vincent van Gogh laughter and you have to say this room have not be tidy up since 1888 and when I return it look like this laughter yeah at least it be now possible to do some vacuum laughter ok I mean I can see there be always person that like react that one or another picture have not be properly tidy up so we can make a short test with you this be a picture by Rene Magritte and I would like you all to inwardly like in you head that be to tidy that up so it be possible that some of you would make it like this laughter yeah I would actually prefer to do it more this way some person would make apple pie out of it but it be a very good example to see that the whole work be more of a handicraft endeavor that involve the very time consume job of cut out the various element and stick they back in new arrangement and it be not do as many person imagine with the computer otherwise it would look like this laughter so now I have be able to tidy up picture that I have want to tidy up for a long time here be a very good example take Jackson Pollock for example it be oh no it be that be a really hard one but after a while I just decide here to go all the way and put the paint back into the can applause or you could go into three dimensional art here we have the fur cup by Meret Oppenheim here I just bring it back to its original state laughter but yeah and it be great you can even go you know or we have this pointillist movement for that of you who be into art the pointillist movement be that kind of painting where everything be break down into dot and pixel and then I this sort of thing be ideal for tidy up laughter so I once apply myself to the work of the inventor of that method Georges Seurat and I collect together all he dot and now they be all in here laughter you can count they afterwards if you like you see that be the wonderful thing about the tidy up art idea it be new so there be no exist tradition in it there be no textbook I mean not yet anyway I mean it be the future we will create laughter but to round thing up I would like to show you just one more this be the village square by Pieter bruegel that be how it look like when you send everyone home laughter yeah maybe you be ask yourselve where old bruegel person go of course they be not go they be all here laughter I just pile they up laughter so I be yeah actually I be kind of finish at that moment and for that who want to see more I have get my book downstairs in the bookshop and I be happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist laughter but before leave I would like to show you I be work right now on another in a related field with my tidy up art method I be work in a related field and I start to bring some order into some flag here that be just my new proposal here for the union jack laughter and then maybe before I leave you yeah I think after you have see that I have to leave anyway laughter yeah that be a hard one I could not find a way to tidy that up properly so I just decide to make it a little bit more simple laughter thank you very much applause
