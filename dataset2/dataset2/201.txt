well this be such a honor and it be wonderful to be in the presence of a organization that be really make a difference in the world and I be intensely grateful for the opportunity to speak to you today and I be also rather surprised because when I look back on my life the last thing I ever want to do be write or be in any way involve in religion after I leave my convent I have finish with religion frankly I think that be it and for 13 year I keep clear of it I want to be a English literature professor and I certainly do not even want to be a writer particularly but then I suffer a series of career catastrophe one after the other and finally find myself in television laughter I say that to Bill Moyers and he say oh we take anybody laughter and I be do some rather controversial religious program this go down very well in the U K where religion be extremely unpopular and so for once for the only time in my life I be finally in the mainstream but I get send to Jerusalem to make a film about early Christianity and there for the first time I encounter the other religious tradition Judaism and Islam the sister religion of Christianity and while I find I know nothing about this faith at all despite my own intensely religious background I have see Judaism only as a kind of prelude to Christianity and I know nothing about Islam at all but in that city that torture city where you see the three faith jostle so uneasily together you also become aware of the profound connection between they and it have be the study of other religious tradition that bring I back to a sense of what religion can be and actually enable I to look at my own faith in a different light and I find some astonishing thing in the course of my study that have never occur to I frankly in the day when I think I would have it with religion I just find the whole thing absolutely incredible this doctrine seem unproven abstract and to my astonishment when I begin seriously study other tradition I begin to realize that belief which we make such a fuss about today be only a very recent religious enthusiasm that surface only in the West in about the 17th century the word belief itself originally mean to love to prize to hold dear in the 17th century it narrow its focus for reason that I be explore in a book I be write at the moment to include to mean a intellectual assent to a set of proposition a credo I believe it do not mean I accept certain creedal article of faith it mean I commit myself I engage myself indeed some of the world tradition think very little of religious orthodoxy in the Quran religious opinion religious orthodoxy be dismiss as zanna self indulgent guesswork about matter that nobody can be certain of one way or the other but which make person quarrelsome and stupidly sectarian laughter so if religion be not about believe thing what be it about what I have find across the board be that religion be about behave differently instead of decide whether or not you believe in God first you do something you behave in a committed way and then you begin to understand the truth of religion and religious doctrine be mean to be summons to action you only understand they when you put they into practice now pride of place in this practice be give to compassion and it be a arrest fact that right across the board in every single one of the major world faiths compassion the ability to feel with the other in the way we have be think about this evening be not only the test of any true religiosity it be also what will bring we into the presence of what Jews Christian and Muslim call God or the Divine it be compassion say the Buddha which bring you to Nirvana why because in compassion when we feel with the other we dethrone ourselves from the center of we world and we put another person there and once we get rid of ego then we be ready to see the Divine and in particular every single one of the major world tradition have highlight have say and put at the core of they tradition what be become know as the Golden Rule First propound by Confucius five century before Christ do not do to other what you would not like they to do to you that he say be the central thread which run through all he teach and that he disciple should put into practice all day and every day and it be the Golden Rule would bring they to the transcendent value that he call ren human heartedness which be a transcendent experience in itself and this be absolutely crucial to the monotheism too there be a famous story about the great rabbi Hillel the old contemporary of Jesus a pagan come to he and offer to convert to Judaism if the rabbi could recite the whole of Jewish teaching while he stand on one leg Hillel stand on one leg and say that which be hateful to you do not do to you neighbor that be the Torah the rest be commentary go and study it laughter and go and study it be what he mean he say in you exegesis you must make it clear that every single verse of the Torah be a commentary a gloss upon the Golden Rule the great Rabbi Meir say that any interpretation of scripture which lead to hatred and disdain or contempt of other person any person whatsoever be illegitimate Saint Augustine make exactly the same point scripture he say teach nothing but charity and we must not leave a interpretation of scripture until we have find a compassionate interpretation of it and this struggle to find compassion in some of this rather rebarbative text be a good dress rehearsal for do the same in ordinary life applause but now look at we world and we be live in a world that be where religion have be hijack where terrorist cite quranic verse to justify they atrocity where instead of take Jesus word love you enemy do not judge other we have the spectacle of Christian endlessly judge other person endlessly use scripture as a way of argue with other person put other person down throughout the age religion have be use to oppress other and this be because of human ego human greed we have a talent as a species for mess up wonderful thing so the tradition also insist and this be a important point I think that you could not and must not confine you compassion to you own group you own nation you own co religionist you own fellow countryman you must have what one of the Chinese sage call jian be concern for everybody love you enemy honor the stranger we form you say the Quran into tribe and nation so that you may know one another and this again this universal outreach be get subdue in the strident use of religion abuse of religion for nefarious gain now I have lose count of the number of taxi driver who when I say to they what I do for a living inform I that religion have be the cause of all the major world war in history wrong the cause of we present woe be political but make no mistake about it religion be a kind of fault line and when a conflict get ingrain in a region religion can get suck in and become part of the problem we modernity have be exceedingly violent between 1914 and 1945 70 million person die in Europe alone as a result of armed conflict and so many of we institution even football which use to be a pleasant pastime now cause riot where person even die and it be not surprising that religion too have be affect by this violent ethos there be also a great deal I think of religious illiteracy around person seem to think now equate religious faith with believe thing as though that we call religious person often believer as though that be the main thing that they do and very often secondary goal get push into the first place in place of compassion and the Golden Rule because the Golden Rule be difficult I sometimes when I be speak to congregation about compassion I sometimes see a mutinous expression cross some of they face because a lot of religious person prefer to be right rather than compassionate laughter now but that be not the whole story since September the 11th when my work on Islam suddenly propel I into public life in a way that I have never imagine I have be able to sort of go all over the world and find everywhere I go a yearning for change I have just come back from Pakistan where literally thousand of person come to my lecture because they be yearning first of all to hear a friendly western voice and especially the young person be come and be ask I the young person be say what can we do what can we do to change thing and my host in Pakistan say look do not be too polite to we tell we where we be go wrong let talk together about where religion be fail because it seem to I that with we current situation be so serious at the moment that any ideology that do not promote a sense of global understanding and global appreciation of each other be fail the test of the time and religion with its wide follow here in the United States person may be be religious in a different way as a report have just show but they still want to be religious it be only western Europe that have retain its secularism which be now begin to look rather endearingly old fashioned but person want to be religious and religion should be make to be a force for harmony in the world which it can and should be because of the Golden Rule do not do to other what you would not have they do to you a ethos that should now be apply globally we should not treat other nation as we would not wish to be treat ourselves and this whatever we wretched belief be a religious matter it be a spiritual matter it be a profound moral matter that engage and should engage we all and as I say there be a hunger for change out there here in the United States I think you see it in this election campaign a longing for change and person in church all over and mosque all over this continent after September the 11th come together locally to create network of understanding with the mosque with the synagogue say we must start to speak to one another I think it be time that we move beyond the idea of toleration and move toward appreciation of the other I have there be one story I would just like to mention this come from the Iliad but it tell you what this spirituality should be you know the story of the Iliad the 10 year war between Greece and Troy in one incident Achilles the famous warrior of Greece take he troops out of the war and the whole war effort suffer and in the course of the ensue muddle he beloved friend Patroclus be kill and kill in single combat by one of the Trojan prince Hector and Achilles go mad with grief and rage and revenge and he mutilate the body he kill Hector he mutilate he body and then he refuse to give the body back for burial to the family which mean that in Greek ethos Hector soul will wander eternally lose and then one night Priam king of Troy a old man come into the Greek camp incognito make he way to Achilles tent to ask for the body of he son and everybody be shock when the old man take off he head cover and show himself and Achilles look at he and think of he father and he start to weep and Priam look at the man who have murder so many of he son and he too start to weep and the sound of they weep fill the house the Greek believe that weep together create a bond between person and then Achilles take the body of Hector he hand it very tenderly to the father and the two man look at each other and see each other as divine that be the ethos find too in all the religion it be what be mean by overcome the horror that we feel when we be under threat of we enemy and begin to appreciate the other it be of great importance that the word for holy in Hebrew apply to God be Kadosh separate other and it be often perhaps the very otherness of we enemy which can give we intimation of that utterly mysterious transcendence which be God and now here be my wish I wish that you would help with the creation launch and propagation of a Charter for Compassion craft by a group of inspirational thinker from the three abrahamic tradition of Judaism Christianity and Islam and base on the fundamental principle of the Golden Rule we need to create a movement among all this person that I meet in my travels you probably meet too who want to join up in some way and reclaim they faith which they feel as I say have be hijack we need to empower person to remember the compassionate ethos and to give guideline this charter would not be a massive document I would like to see it to give guideline as to how to interpret the scripture this text that be be abuse remember what the rabbi and what Augustine say about how scripture should be govern by the principle of charity let get back to that and the idea too of Jews Christian and Muslim this tradition now so often at loggerheads work together to create a document which we hope will be sign by a thousand at least of major religious leader from all the tradition of the world and you be the person I be just a solitary scholar despite the idea that I love a good time which I be rather amazed to see come up on I I actually spend a great deal of time alone study and I be not very you be the person with media knowledge to explain to I how we can get this to everybody everybody on the planet I have have some preliminary talk and Archbishop Desmond Tutu for example be very happy to give he name to this as be Imam Feisal Rauf the Imam in New York City also I would be work with the Alliance of Civilizations at the United Nations I be part of that United Nations initiative call the Alliance of Civilizations which be ask by Kofi Annan to diagnose the cause of extremism and to give practical guideline to member state about how to avoid the escalation of further extremism and the Alliance have tell I that they be very happy to work with it the importance of this be that this be I can see some of you start to look worried because you think it be a slow and cumbersome body but what the United Nations can do be give we some neutrality so that this be not see as a western or a Christian initiative but that it be come as it be from the United Nations from the world who would help with the sort of bureaucracy of this and so I do urge you to join I in make in this charter to build this charter launch it and propagate it so that it become I would like to see it in every college every church every mosque every synagogue in the world so that person can look at they tradition reclaim it and make religion a source of peace in the world which it can and should be thank you very much applause
