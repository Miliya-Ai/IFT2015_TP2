I think in get up to my TED wish I would try to begin by put in perspective what I try to do and how it fit with what they try to do we live in a world that everyone know be interdependent but insufficient in three major way it be first of all profoundly unequal half the world person still live on less than two dollar a day a billion person with no access to clean water two and a half billion no access to sanitation a billion go to bed hungry every night one in four death every year from AIDS TB malaria and the variety of infection associate with dirty water 80 percent of they under five year of age even in wealthy country it be common now to see inequality grow in the United States since 2001 we have have five year of economic growth five year of productivity growth in the workplace but median wages be stagnant and the percentage of work family drop below the poverty line be up by four percent the percentage of work family without health care up by four percent so this interdependent world which have be pretty good to most of we which be why we be all here in Northern California do what we do for a living enjoy this evening be profoundly unequal it be also unstable unstable because of the threat of terror weapon of mass destruction the spread of global disease and a sense that we be vulnerable to it in a way that we be not not so many year ago and perhaps most important of all it be unsustainable because of climate change resource depletion and species destruction when I think about the world I would like to leave to my daughter and the grandchild I hope to have it be a world that move away from unequal unstable unsustainable interdependence to integrate community locally nationally and globally that share the characteristic of all successful community a broadly share accessible set of opportunity a share sense of responsibility for the success of the common enterprise and a genuine sense of belong all easy say than do when the terrorist incident occur in the United Kingdom a couple of year ago I think even though they do not claim as many life as we lose in the United States on 9 11 I think the thing that trouble the British most be that the perpetrator be not invader but homegrown citizen whose religious and political identity be more important to they than the person they grow up with go to school with work with share weekend with share meal with in other word they think they difference be more important than they common humanity it be the central psychological plague of humankind in the 21st century into this mix person like we who be not in public office have more power to do good than at any time in history because more than half the world person live under government they vote in and can vote out and even non democratic government be more sensitive to public opinion because primarily of the power of the internet person of modest means can band together and amass vast sum of money that can change the world for some public good if they all agree when the tsunami hit South Asia the United States contribute 1 2 billion dollar 30 percent of we household give half of they give over the internet the median contribution be somewhere around 57 dollar and thirdly because of the rise of non governmental organization they business other citizen group have enormous power to affect the life of we fellow human being when I become president in 1993 there be none of this organization in Russia there be now a couple of hundred thousand none in India there be now at least a half a million active none in China there be now 250 000 register with the government probably twice again that many who be not register for political reason when I organize my foundation and I think about the world as it be and the world that I hope to leave to the next generation and I try to be realistic about what I have care about all my life that I could still have a impact on I want to focus on activity that would help to alleviate poverty fight disease combat climate change bridge the religious racial and other divide that torment the world but to do it in a way that would either use whatever particular skill we could put together in we group to change the way some public good function be perform so that it would sweep across the world more you see one reference to that in what we be able to do with AIDS drug and I want to say that the head of we AIDS effort and the person who also be primarily active in the wish I will make tonight Ira Magaziner be here with I and I want to thank he for everything he be do he be over there applause when I get out of office and be ask to work first in the Caribbean to try to help deal with the AIDS crisis generic drug be available for about 500 dollar a person a year if you buy they in vast bulk you could get they at a little under 400 dollar the first country we go to work in the Bahamas be pay 3 500 dollar for this drug the market be so terribly disorganized that they be buy this medicine through two agent who be gig they sevenfold so the very first week we be work we get the price down to 500 dollar and all of a sudden they could save seven time as many life for the same amount of money then we go to work with the manufacturer of AIDS medicine one of whom be cite in the film and negotiate a whole different change in business strategy because even at 500 dollar this drug be be sell on a high margin low volume uncertain payment basis so we work on improve the productivity of the operation and the supply chain and go to a low margin high volume absolutely certain payment business I joke that the main contribution we make to the battle against AIDS be to get the manufacturer to change from a jewelry store to a grocery store strategy but the price go to 140 dollar from 500 and pretty soon the average price be 192 dollar now we can get it for about 100 dollar child medicine be 600 dollar because nobody could afford to buy any of it we negotiate it down to 190 then the French impose they brilliantly conceive airline tax to create a something call UNITAID get a bunch of other country to help that child medicine be now 60 dollar a person a year the only thing that be keep we from basically save the life of everybody who need the medicine to stay alive be the absence of system necessary to diagnose treat and care for person and deliver this medicine we start a childhood obesity initiative with the Heart Association in America we try to do the same thing by negotiate industry right deal with the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric and other dangerous content of food go to we child in the school we just reorganize the market and it occur to I that in this whole non governmental world somebody need to be think about organize public goods market and that be now what we be try to do and work with this large city group to fight climate change to negotiate huge big volume deal that will enable city which generate 75 percent of the world greenhouse gas to drastically and quickly reduce greenhouse gas emission in a way that be good economics and this whole discussion as if it be some sort of economic burden be a mystery to I I think it be a bird nest on the ground when Al Gore win he well deserve Oscar for the Inconvenient Truth movie I be thrilled but I have urge he to make a second movie quickly for that of you who see a Inconvenient Truth the most important slide in the Gore lecture be the last one which show here be where greenhouse gas be go if we do not do anything here be where they could go and then there be six different category of thing we can do to change the trajectory we need a movie on that six category and all of you need to have it embed in you brain and to organize yourselves around it so we be try to do that so organize this market be one thing we try to do now we have take on a second thing and this get to my wish it have be my experience in work in develop country that while the headline may all be the pessimistic headline may say well we can not do this that or the other thing because of corruption I think incapacity be a far big problem in poor country than corruption and feed corruption we now have the money give this low price to distribute AIDS drug all over the world to person we can not presently reach today this low price be available in the 25 country where we work and in a total of 62 country and about 550 000 person be get the benefit of they but the money be there to reach other the system be not there to reach the person so what we have be try to do work first in Rwanda and then in Malawi and other place but I want to talk about Rwanda tonight be to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area that can be use to deal with AIDS TB malaria other infectious disease maternal and child health and a whole range of health issue poor person be grapple with in the develop world that can first be scale for the whole nation of Rwanda and then will be a model that could literally be implement in any other poor country in the world and the test be one will it do the job will it provide high quality care and two will it do it at a price that will enable the country to sustain a health care system without foreign donor after five to 10 year because the long I deal with this problem the more convinced I be that we have to whether it be economics health education whatever we have to build system and the absence of system that function break the connection which get you all in this seat tonight you think about whatever you life have be however many obstacle you have face in you life at critical juncture you always know there be a predictable connection between the effort you exert and the result you achieve in a world with no system with chaos everything become a guerilla struggle and this predictability be not there and it become almost impossible to save life educate kid develop economy whatever the person in my view who have do the good job of this in the health care area of build a system in a very poor area be Dr Paul Farmer who many of you know have work for now 20 year with he group partner in Health primarily in Haiti where he start but they have also work in Russia in Peru and other place around the world as poor as Haiti be in the area where Farmer clinic be active and they serve a catchment area far great than the medical professional they have would indicate they could serve since 1988 they have not lose one person to tuberculosis not one and they have achieve a lot of other amazing health result so when we decide to work in Rwanda on try to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the AIDS problem we want to build a healthcare network because it have be totally destroy during the genocide in 1994 and the per capita income be still under a dollar a day so I ring up ask Paul Farmer if he would help because it seem to I if we could prove there be a model in Haiti and a model in Rwanda that we could then take all over the country number one it would be a wonderful thing for a country that have suffer as much as any on Earth in the last 15 year and number two we would have something that could then be adapt to any other poor country anywhere in the world and so we have set about do that now we start work together 18 month ago and we be work in a area call Southern Kayonza which be one of the poor area in Rwanda with a group that originally include about 400 000 person we be essentially implement what Paul Farmer do in Haiti he develop and train pay community health worker who be able to identify health problem ensure that person who have aid or tb be properly diagnose and take they medicine regularly who work on bring about health education clean water and sanitation provide nutritional supplement and move person up the chain of health care if they have problem of the severity that require it the procedure that make this work have be perfect as I say by Paul Farmer and he team in they work in rural Haiti over the last 20 year recently we do a evaluation of the first 18 month of we effort in Rwanda and the result be so good that the Rwandan government have now agree to adopt the model for the entire country and have strongly support and put the full resource of the government behind it I will tell you a little bit about we team because it be indicative of what we do we have about 500 person around the world work in we AIDS program some of they for nothing just for transportation room and board and then we have other work in this other related program we business plan in Rwanda be put together under the leadership of Diana Noble who be a unusually gifted woman but not unusual in the type of person who have be willing to do this kind of work she be the young partner at Schroder Ventures in London in she 20 she be ceo of a successful e venture she start and build Reed Elsevier Ventures and at 45 she decide she want to do something different with she life so she now work full time on this for very little pay she and she team of former business person have create a business plan that will enable we to scale this health system up for the whole country and it would be worthy of the kind of private equity work she use to do when she be make a lot more money for it when we come to this rural area 45 percent of the child under the age of five have stunt growth due to malnutrition 23 percent of they die before they reach the age of five mortality at birth be over two and a half percent over 15 percent of the death among adult and child occur because of intestinal parasite and diarrhea from dirty water and inadequate sanitation all entirely preventable and treatable over 13 percent of the death be from respiratory illness again all preventable and treatable and not a single soul in this area be be treat for AIDS or tuberculosis within the first 18 month the follow thing happen we go from zero to about 2 000 person be treat for AIDS that be 80 percent of the person who need treatment in this area listen to this less than four tenth of one percent of that be treat stop take they medicine or otherwise default on treatment that be low than the figure in the United States less than three tenth of one percent have to transfer to the more expensive second line drug 400 000 pregnant woman be bring into counseling and will give birth for the first time within a organize healthcare system that be about 43 percent of all the pregnancy about 40 percent of all the person I say 400 000 I mean 40 000 about 40 percent of all the person who need tb treatment be now get it in just 18 month up from zero when we start 43 percent of the child in need of a infant feeding program to prevent malnutrition and early death be now get the food supplement they need to stay alive and to grow we have start the first malaria treatment program they have ever have there patient admit to a hospital that be destroy during the genocide that we have renovate along with four other clinic complete with solar power generator good lab technology we now be treat 325 person a month despite the fact that almost 100 percent of the AIDS patient be now treat at home and the most important thing be because we have implement Paul Farmer model use community health worker we estimate that this system could be put into place for all of Rwanda for between five and six percent of GDP and that the government could sustain that without depend on foreign aid after five or six year and for that of you who understand healthcare economics you know that all wealthy country spend between nine and 11 percent of gdp on health care except for the United States we spend 16 but that be a story for another day laughter we be now work with partner in Health and the Ministry of Health in Rwanda and we Foundation folk to scale this system up we be also begin to do this in Malawi and Lesotho and we have similar project in Tanzania Mozambique Kenya and Ethiopia with other partner try to achieve the same thing to save as many life as quickly as we can but to do it in a systematic way that can be implement nationwide and then with a model that can be implement in any country in the world we need initial upfront investment to train doctor nurse health administration and community health worker throughout the country to set up the information technology the solar energy the water and sanitation the transportation infrastructure but over a five to 10 year period we will take down the need for outside assistance and eventually it will be phase out my wish be that TED assist we in we work and help we to build a high quality rural health system in a poor country Rwanda that can be a model for Africa and indeed for any poor country anywhere in the world my belief be that this will help we to build a more integrated world with more partner and few terrorist with more productive citizen and few hater a place we have all want we kid and we grandchild to grow up in it have be a honor for I particularly to work in Rwanda where we also have a major economic development project in partnership with Sir Tom Hunter the Scottish philanthropist where last year we use the same thing with AIDS drug cut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rate on microcredit loan by 30 percent and achieve three to four hundred percent increase in crop yield with the farmer this person have be through a lot and none of we most of all I help they when they be on the verge of destroy each other we be undo that now and they be so over it and so into they future we be do this in a environmentally responsible way I be do my good to convince they not to run the electric grid to the 35 percent of the person that have no access but to do it with clean energy to have responsible reforestation project the Rwandan interestingly enough have be quite good Mr Wilson in preserve they topsoil there be a couple of guy from southern farming family the first thing I do when I go out to this place be to get down on my hand and knee and dig in the dirt and see what they have do with it we have a chance here to prove that a country that almost slaughter itself out of existence can practice reconciliation reorganize itself focus on tomorrow and provide comprehensive quality health care with minimal outside help I be grateful for this prize and I will use it to that end we could use some more help to do this but think of what it would mean if we could have a world class health system in Rwanda in a country with a less than one dollar a day per capita income one that could save hundred of million of life over the next decade if apply to every similarly situate country on Earth it be worth a try and I believe it would succeed thank you and God bless you applause
