I be delighted to be here I be honor by the invitation and thanks I would love to talk about stuff that I be interested in but unfortunately I suspect that what I be interested in will not interest many other person first off my badge say I be a astronomer I would love to talk about my astronomy but I suspect that the number of person who be interested in radiative transfer in non gray atmosphere and polarization of light in Jupiter upper atmosphere be the number of person who have fit in a bus shelter so I be not go to talk about that laughter it would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happen in 1986 and 1987 when a computer hacker be break into we system over at Lawrence Berkeley Labs and I catch the guy and they turn out to be work for what be then the soviet KGB and steal information and sell it and I would love to talk about that and it would be fun but 20 year later I find computer security frankly to be kind of bore it be tedious I be the first time you do something it be science the second time it be engineer a third time it be just be a technician I be a scientist once I do something I do something else so I be not go to talk about that nor be I go to talk about what I think be obvious statement from my first book Silicon Snake Oil or my second book nor be I go to talk about why I believe computer do not belong in school I feel that there be a massive and bizarre idea go around that we have to bring more computer into school my idea be no no get they out of school and keep they out of school and I would love to talk about this but I think the argument be so obvious to anyone who be hang around a fourth grade classroom that it do not need much talk about but I guess I may be very wrong about that and everything else that I have say so do not go back and read my dissertation it probably have lie in it as well have say that I outline my talk about five minute ago laughter and if you look at it over here the main thing I write on my thumb be the future I be suppose to talk about the future yes oh right and my feeling be ask I to talk about the future be bizarre because I have get gray hair and so it be kind of silly for I to talk about the future in fact I think that if you really want to know what the future be go to be if you really want to know about the future do not ask a technologist a scientist a physicist no do not ask somebody who be write code no if you want to know what society be go to be like in 20 year ask a kindergarten teacher they know in fact do not ask just any kindergarten teacher ask a experienced one they be the one who know what society be go to be like in another generation I do not nor I suspect do many other person who be talk about what the future will bring certainly all of we can imagine this cool new thing that be go to be there but to I thing be not the future what I ask myself be what be society be go to be like when the kid today be phenomenally good at text messaging and spend a huge amount of on screen time but have never go bowl together change be happen and the change that be happen be not one that be in software but that be not what I be go to talk about I would love to talk about it it would be fun but I want to talk about what I be do now what be I do now oh the other thing that I think I would like to talk about be right over here right over here be that visible what I have like to talk about be one sided thing I would dearly love to talk about thing that have one side because I love Mobius loop I not only love Mobius loop but I be one of the very few person if not the only person in the world that make Klein bottle right away I hope that all of you eye glaze over this be a Klein bottle for that of you in the audience who know you roll you eye and say yup I know all about it it be one side it be a bottle whose inside be its outside it have zero volume and it be non orientable it have wonderful property if you take two Mobius loop and sew they common edge together you get one of this and I make they out of glass and I would love to talk to you about this but I do not have much in the way of thing to say because laughter Chris Anderson I have get a cold however the d in TED of course stand for design just two week ago I make you know I have be make small medium and big Klein bottle for the trade but what I have just make and I be delighted to show you first time in public here this be a Klein bottle wine bottle which although in four dimension it should not be able to hold any fluid at all it be perfectly capable of do so because we universe have only three spatial dimension and because we universe be only three spatial dimension it can hold fluid so it be highly that one the cool one that be a month of my life but although I would love to talk about topology with you I be not go to laughter instead I be go to mention my mom who pass away last summer have collect photograph of I as mother will do could somebody put this guy up and I look over she album and she have collect a picture of I stand well sit in 1969 in front of a bunch of dial and I look at it and say oh my god that be I when I be work at the electronic music studio as a technician repair and maintain the electronic music studio at SUNY Buffalo and wow way back machine and I say to myself oh yeah and it send I back soon after that I find in another picture that she have a picture of I this guy over here of course be I this man be Robert Moog the inventor of the Moog synthesizer who pass away this past August Robert Moog be a generous kind person extraordinarily competent engineer a musician who take time from he life to teach I a sophomore a freshman at SUNY Buffalo he have come up from Trumansburg to teach I not just about the Moog synthesizer but we would be sit there I be study physics at the time this be 1969 70 71 we be study physics I be study physics and he be say that be a good thing to do do not get catch up in electronic music if you be do physics mentoring I he have come up and spend hour and hour with I he write a letter of recommendation for I to get into graduate school in the background my bicycle I realize that this picture be take at a friend living room Bob Moog come by and haul a whole pile of equipment to show Greg Flint and I thing about this we sit around talk about Fourier transform Bessel function modulation transfer function stuff like this Bob pass this past summer have be a loss to all of we anyone who be a musician have be profoundly influence by Robert Moog applause and I will just say what I be about to do what I be about to do I hope you can recognize that there be a distort sine wave almost a triangular wave upon this Hewlett Packard oscilloscope oh cool I can get to this place over here right kid kid be what I be go to talk about be that okay it say kid over here that be what I would like to talk about I have decide that for I at least I do not have a big enough head so I think locally and I act locally I feel that the good way I can help out anything be to help out very very locally so ph d this and degree there and the yadda yadda I be talk about this stuff to some schoolteacher about a year ago and one of they several of they would come up to I and say well how come you be not teach and I say well I have teach graduate I have have graduate student I have teach undergraduate class no they say if you be so into kid and all this stuff how come you be not over here on the front line put you money where you mouth be be true be true I teach eighth grade science four day a week not just show up every now and then no no no no no I take attendance I take lunch hour applause this be not no no no this be not clap I strongly suggest that this be a good thing for each of you to do not just show up to class every now and then teach a solid week okay I be teach three quarter time but good enough one of the thing that I have do for my science student be to tell they look I be go to teach you college level physics no calculus I will cut out that you will not need to know trig but you will need to know eighth grade algebra and we be go to do serious experiment none of this open to chapter seven and do all the odd problem set we be go to be do genuine physics and that be one of the thing I think I would do right now high pitch tone oh before I even turn that on one of the thing that we do about three week ago in my class this be through the lens and one of the thing we use a lens for be to measure the speed of light my student in El Cerrito with my help of course and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope measure the speed of light we be off by 25 percent how many eighth grader do you know of who have measure the speed of light in addition to that we have measure the speed of sound I would love to measure the speed of light here I be all set to do it and I be think aw man I be just go to impose upon the power that be and measure the speed of light and I be all set to do it I be all set to do it but then it turn out that to set up here you have like 10 minute to set up and there be no time to do it so next time maybe I will measure the speed of light but meanwhile let measure the speed of sound well the obvious way to measure the speed of sound be to bounce sound off something and look at the echo but probably one of my student Ariel unclear say could we measure the speed of light use the wave equation and all of you know the wave equation be the frequency time the wavelength of any wave be a constant when the frequency go up the wavelength come down Wavelength go up frequency go down so if we have a wave here over here that be what be interesting as the pitch go up thing get close pitch go down thing stretch out right this be simple physics all of you know this from eighth grade remember what they do not tell you in physics in eighth grade physics but they should have and I wish they have be that if you multiply the frequency time the wavelength of sound or light you get a constant and that constant be the speed of sound so in order to measure the speed of sound all I have get to do be know its frequency well that be easy I have get a frequency counter right here set it up to around a above a above a there be a a more or less now so I know the frequency it be 1 76 kilohertz I measure its wavelength all I need now be to flip on another beam and the bottom beam be I talk right so anytime I talk you would see it on the screen I will put it over here and as I move this away from the source you will notice the spiral the slinky move we be go through different node of the wave come out this way that of you who be physicist I hear you roll you eye but bear with I laughter to measure the wavelength all I need to do be measure the distance from here one full wave over to here from here to here be the wavelength of sound so I will put a measure tape here measure tape here move it back over to here I have move the microphone 20 centimeter 0 2 meter from here back to here 20 centimeter ok let go back to Mr elmo and we will say the frequency be 1 76 kilohertz or 1760 the wavelength be 0 2 meter let figure out what this be laughter applause 1 76 time 0 2 over here be 352 meter per second if you look it up in the book it be really 343 but here with kludgy material and lousy drink we have be able to measure the speed of sound to not bad pretty good all of which come to what I want to say go back to this picture of I a million year ago it be 1971 the Vietnam War be go on and I be like oh my god I be study physics Landau Lipschitz Resnick and Halliday I be go home for a midterm a riot be go on on campus there be a riot hey elmo be do off there be a riot go on on campus and the police be chase I right I be walk across campus cop come and look at I and say you you be a student pull out a gun go boom and a tear gas canister the size of a Pepsi can go by my head whoosh I get a breath of tear gas and I can not breathe this cop come after I with a rifle he want to clunk I over the head I be say I get to clear out of here I go run across campus quick as I can I duck into Hayes Hall it be one of this bell tower build the cop chase I chase I up the first floor second floor third floor chase I into this room the entranceway to the bell tower I slam the door behind I climb up go past this place where I see a pendulum tick and I be think oh yeah the square root of the length be proportional to its period laughter I keep climb up go back I go to a place where a dowel split off there be a clock clock clock clock the time be go backwards because I be inside of it I be think of Lorenz contraction and einsteinian relativity I climb up and there be this place way in the back that you climb up this wooden ladder I pop up the top and there be a cupola a dome one of this ten foot dome I be look out and I be see the cop bash student head shoot tear gas and watch student throw brick and I be ask what be I do here why be I here then I remember what my English teacher in high school say namely that when they cast bell they write inscription on they so I wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bell and I look at it I be ask myself why be I here so at this time I would like to tell you the word inscribe upon the Hayes Hall tower bell all truth be one in this light may science and religion endeavor here for the steady evolution of mankind from darkness to light from narrowness to broad mindedness from prejudice to tolerance it be the voice of life which call we to come and learn thank you very much
