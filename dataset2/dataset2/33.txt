I will just take you to Bangladesh for a minute before I tell that story we should ask ourselves the question why do poverty exist I mean there be plenty of knowledge and scientific breakthrough we all live in the same planet but there be still a great deal of poverty in the world and I think so I want to throw a perspective that I have so that we can assess this project or any other project for that matter to see whether it be contribute or contribute to poverty or try to alleviate it rich country have be send aid to poor country for the last 60 year and by and large this have fail and you can see this book write by someone who work in the World Bank for 20 year and he find economic growth in this country to be elusive by and large it do not work so the question be why be that in my mind there be something to learn from the history of Europe I mean even here yesterday I be walk across the street and they show three bishop be execute 500 year ago right across the street from here so my point be there be a lot of struggle have go in Europe where citizen be empower by technology and they demand authority from to come down from they high horse and in the end there be good bargaining between the authority and citizen and democracy capitalism everything else flourish and so you can see the real process of and this be back up by this 500 page book that the authority come down and citizen get up but if you look if you have that perspective then you can see what happen in the last 60 year aid actually do the opposite it empower authority and as a result marginalize citizen the authority do not have the reason to make economic growth happen so that they could tax person and make more money for to run they business because they be get it from abroad and in fact if you see oil rich country where citizen be not yet empower the same thing go Nigeria Saudi Arabia all sort of country because the aid and oil or mineral money act the same way it empower authority without activate the citizen they hand leg brain what have you and if you agree with that then I think the good way to improve this country be to recognize that economic development be of the person by the person for the person and that be the real network effect if citizen can network and make themselves more organized and productive so that they voice be hear so then thing would improve and to contrast that you can see the most important institution in the world the World Bank be a organization of the government by the government for the government just see the contrast and that be the perspective I have and then I can start my story of course how would you empower citizen there could be all sort of technology and one be cell phone recently the economist recognize this but I stumble upon the idea 12 year ago and that be what I have be work on so 12 year ago I be try to be a investment banker in New York we have quite a few we colleague be connect by a computer network and we get more productive because we do not have to exchange floppy disk we could update each other more often but one time it break down and it remind I of a day in 1971 there be a war go on in my country and my family move out of a urban place where we use to live to a remote rural area where it be safe and one time my mother ask I to get some medicine for a young sibling and I walk 10 mile or so all morning to get there to the medicine man and he be not there so I walk all afternoon back so I have another unproductive day so while I be sit in a tall building in New York I put that two experience together side by side and basically conclude that connectivity be productivity whether it be in a modern office or a underdeveloped village so naturally I the implication of that be that the telephone be a weapon against poverty and if that be the case then the question be how many telephone do we have at that time and it turn out that there be one telephone in Bangladesh for every 500 person and all that phone be in the few urban place the vast rural area where 100 million person live there be no telephone so just imagine how many man month or man year be waste just like I waste a day if you just multiply by 100 million person let say lose one day a month whatever and you see a vast amount of resource waste and after all poor country like rich country one thing we have get equal be they day be the same length 24 hour so if you lose that precious resource where you be somewhat equal to the rich country that be a huge waste so I start look for any evidence that do connectivity really increase productivity and I could not find much really but I find this graph produce by the ITU which be the International Telecommunication Union base in Geneva they show a interesting thing that you see the horizontal axis be where you place you country so the United States or the UK would be here outside and so the impact of one new telephone which be on the vertical axis be very little but if you come back to a poor country where the gnp per capita be let say 500 dollar or 300 dollar then the impact be huge 6 000 dollar or 5 000 dollar the question be how much do it cost to install a new telephone in Bangladesh it turn out 2 000 dollar so if you spend 2 000 dollar and let say the telephone last 10 year and if 5 000 dollar every year so that be 50 000 dollar so obviously this be a gadget to have and of course if the cost of install a telephone be go down because there be a digital revolution go on then it would be even more dramatic and I know a little economics by then it say Adam Smith teach we that specialization lead to productivity but how would you specialize let say I be a fisherman and a farmer and Chris be a fisherman farmer both be generalist so the point be that we could only the only way we could depend on each other be if we can connect with each other and if we be neighbor I could just walk over to he house but then we be limit we economic sphere to something very small area but in order to expand that you need a river or you need a highway or you need telephone line but in any event it be connectivity that lead to dependability and that lead to specialization that lead to productivity so the question be I start look at this issue and go back and forth between Bangladesh and New York there be a lot of reason person tell I why we do not have enough telephone and one of they be the lack buy power poor person apparently do not have the power to buy but the point be if it be a production tool why do we have to worry about that I mean in America person buy car and they put very little money down they get a car and they go to work the work pay they a salary the salary allow they to pay for the car over time the car pay for itself so if the telephone be a production tool then we do not quite have to worry about the purchasing power and of course even if that be true then what about initial buying power so then the question be why can not we have some kind of share access in the United States we have everybody need a banking service but very few of we be try to buy a bank so it be a bank tend to serve a whole community so we could do that for telephone and also person tell I that we have a lot of important primary need to meet food clothing shelter whatever but again it be very paternalistic you should be raise income and let person decide what they want to do with they money but the real problem be the lack of other infrastructure see you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing for instance the internet be boom in the U S because there be there be person who have computer they have modem they have telephone line so it be very easy to bring in a new idea like the internet but that be what be lack in a poor country so for example we do not have way to have credit check few bank to collect bill etc but that be why I notice Grameen Bank which be a bank for poor person and have 1 100 branch 12 000 employee 2 3 million borrower and they have this branch I think I could put cell tower and create a network and anyway to cut the time short so I start I first go to they and say you know perhaps I could connect all you branch and make you more efficient but you know they have after all evolve in a country without telephone so they be decentralize I mean of course there might be other good reason but this be one of the reason they have to be and so they be not that interested to connect all they branch and then to be and rock the boat so I start focus what be it that they really do so what happen be that somebody borrow money from the bank she typically buy a cow the cow give milk and she sell the milk to the villager and pay off the loan and this be a business for she but it be milk for everybody else and suddenly I realize that a cell phone could be a cow because some way she could borrow 200 dollar from the bank get a phone and have the phone for everybody and it be a business for she so I write to the bank and they think for a while and they say it be a little crazy but logical if you think it can be do come and make it happen so I quit my job I go back to Bangladesh I create a company in America call Gonofone which in Bengali mean person phone and angel investor in America put in money into that I fly around the world after about a million I mean I get reject from lot of place because I be not only try to go to a poor country I be try to go to the poor of the poor country after about a million mile and a meaningful a substantial loss of hair I eventually put together a consortium and which involve the Norwegian telephone company which provide the know how and the Grameen Bank provide the infrastructure to spread the service to make the story short here be the coverage of the country you can see it be pretty much cover even in Bangladesh there be some empty place but we be also invest around another 300 million dollar this year to extend that coverage now about that cow model I talk about there be about 115 000 person who be retail telephone service in they neighborhood and it be serve 52 000 village which represent about 80 million person and this phone be generate about 100 million dollar for the company and two dollar profit per entrepreneur per day which be like 700 dollar per year and of course it be very beneficial in a lot of way it increase income improve welfare etc and the result be right now this company be the large telephone company with 3 5 million subscriber 115 000 of this phone I talk about that produce about a third of the traffic in the network and 2004 the net profit after tax very serious tax be 120 million dollar and the company contribute about 190 million dollar to the government coffer and again here be some of the lesson the government need to provide economically viable service actually this be a instance where private company can provide that government need to subsidize private company this be what some person think and actually private company help government with tax poor person be recipient poor person be a resource service cost too much for the poor they involvement reduce the cost the poor be uneducated and can not do much they be very eager learner and very capable survivor I have be very surprised most of they learn how to operate a telephone within a day poor country need aid business this one company have raise the if the ideal figure be even five percent true this one company be raise the GNP of the country much more than the aid the country receive and as I be try to show you as far as I be concerned aid do damages because it remove the government from its citizen and this be a new project I have with Dean Kamen the famous inventor in America he have produce some power generator which we be now do a experiment in Bangladesh in two village where cow manure be produce biogas which be run this generator and each of this generator be sell electricity to 20 house each it be just a experiment we do not know how far it will go but it be go on thank you
