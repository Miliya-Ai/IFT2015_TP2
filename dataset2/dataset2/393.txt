the new I be beauty laughter yeah person use to say Norman ok but if you follow what he say everything would be usable but it would be ugly well I do not have that in mind so this be neat thank you for set up my display I mean it be just wonderful and I have not the slight idea of what it do or what it be good for but I want it and that be my new life my new life be try to understand what beauty be about and pretty and emotion the new I be all about make thing kind of neat and fun and so this be a Philippe Starck juicer produce by Alessi it be just neat it be fun it be so much fun I have it in my house but I have it in the entryway I do not use it to make juice laughter in fact I buy the gold plate special edition and it come with a little slip of paper that say do not use this juicer to make juice the acid will ruin the gold plating laughter so actually I take a carton of orange juice and I pour it in the glass to take this picture laughter beneath it be a wonderful knife it be a global cutting knife make in Japan First of all look at the shape it be just wonderful to look at Second of all it be really beautifully balance it hold well it feel well and third of all it be so sharp it just cut it be a delight to use and so it be get everything right it be beautiful and it be functional and I can tell you story about it which make it reflective and so you will see I have a theory of emotion and that be the three component Hiroshi Ishii and he group at the MIT Media Lab take a ping pong table and place a projector above it and on the ping pong table they project a image of water with fish swimming in it and as you play ping pong whenever the ball hit part of the table the ripple spread out and the fish run away but of course then the ball hit the other side the ripple hit the poor fish they can not find any peace and quiet laughter be that a good way to play ping pong no but be it fun yeah yeah or look at Google if you type in oh say emotion and design you get 10 page of result so Google just take they logo and they spread it out instead of say you get 73 000 result this be one through 20 next they just give you as many o as there be page it be really simple and subtle I bet a lot of you have see it and never notice it that be the subconscious mind that sort of notice it it probably be kind of pleasant and you do not know why and it be just clever and of course what be especially good be if you type design and emotion the first response out of that 10 page be my website laughter now the weird thing be Google lie because if I type design and emotion it say you do not need the and we do it anyway so ok so I type design emotion and my website be not first again it be third oh well different story there be this wonderful review in the New York Times about the MINI Cooper automobile it say you know this be a car that have lot of fault buy it anyway it be so much fun to drive and if you look at the inside of the car I mean I love it I want to see it I rent it this be I take a picture while my son be drive and the inside of the car the whole design be fun it be round it be neat the control work wonderfully so that be my new life it be all about fun I really have the feeling that pleasant thing work good and that never make any sense to I until I finally figure out look I be go to put a plank on the ground so imagine I have a plank about two foot wide and 30 foot long and I be go to walk on it and you see I can walk on it without look I can go back and forth and I can jump up and down no problem now I be go to put the plank 300 foot in the air and I be not go to go near it thank you intense fear paralyze you it actually affect the way the brain work so Paul Saffo before he talk say that he do not really have it down until just a few day or hour before the talk and that anxiety be really helpful in cause he to focus that be what fear and anxiety do it cause you to be what be call depth first processing to focus not be distract and I could not force myself across that now some person can circus worker steel worker but it really change the way you think and then a psychologist Alice Isen do this wonderful experiment she bring student in to solve problem so she would bring person into the room and there would be a string hang down here and a string hang down here it be a empty room except for a table with a bunch of crap on it some paper and scissors and stuff and she would bring they in and she would say this be a iq test and it determine how well you do in life would you tie that two string together so they would take one string and they would pull it over here and they could not reach the other string still can not reach it and basically none of they could solve it you bring in a second group of person and you say oh before we start I get this box of candy and I do not eat candy would you like the box of candy and turn out they like it and it make they happy not very happy but a little bit of happy and guess what they solve the problem and it turn out that when you be anxious you squirt neural transmitter in the brain which focus you make you depth first and when you be happy what we call positive valence you squirt dopamine into the prefrontal lobe which make you a breadth first problem solver you be more susceptible to interruption you do out of the box thinking that be what brainstorming be about right with brainstorming we make you happy we play game and we say no criticism and you get all this weird neat idea but in fact if that be how you always be you would never get any work do because you would be work along and say oh I get a new way of do it so to get work do you have get to set a deadline right you have get be anxious the brain work differently if you be happy thing work well because you be more creative you get a little problem you say ah I will figure it out no big deal there be something I call the visceral level of processing and there will be visceral level design Biology we have co adapt through biology to like bright color that be especially good that mammal and primate like fruit and bright plant because you eat the fruit and you thereby spread the seed there be a amazing amount of stuff that be build into the brain we dislike bitter taste we dislike loud sound we dislike hot temperature cold temperature we dislike scold voice we dislike frown face we like symmetrical face etc etc so that be the visceral level in design you can express visceral in lot of way like the choice of type font and the red for hot exciting or the 1963 Jaguar it be actually a crummy car fall apart all the time but the owner love it and it be beautiful it be in the Museum of Modern Art A water bottle you buy it because of the bottle not because of the water and when person be finish they do not throw it away they keep it for you know it be like the old wine bottle you keep it for decoration or maybe fill it with water again which prove it be not the water it be all about the visceral experience the middle level of processing be the behavioral level and that be actually where most of we stuff get do Visceral be subconscious you be unaware of it behavioral be subconscious you be unaware of it almost everything we do be subconscious I be walk around the stage I be not attend to the control of my leg I be do a lot most of my talk be subconscious it have be rehearse and think about a lot most of what we do be subconscious automatic behavior skilled behavior be subconscious control by the behavioral side and behavioral design be all about feel in control which include usability understanding but also the feel and heft that be why the global knife be so neat they be so nicely balanced so sharp that you really feel you be in control of the cutting or just drive a high performance sport car over a demand curb again feel that you be in complete control of the environment or the sensual feeling this be a Kohler shower a waterfall shower and actually all that knob beneath be also showerhead it will squirt you all around and you can stay in that shower for hour and not waste water by the way because it recirculate the same dirty water laughter or this this be a really neat teapot I find at high tea at the Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago it be a Ronnefeldt tilt teapot that be kind of what the teapot look like but the way you use it be you lay it on its back and you put tea in and then you fill it with water the water then seep over the tea and the tea be sit in this stuff to the right the tea be to the right of this line there be a little ledge inside so the tea be sit there and the water be fill it up like that and when the tea be ready or almost ready you tilt it and that mean the tea be partially cover while it complete the brewing and when it be finish you put it vertically and now the tea be you remember above this line and the water only come to here and so it keep the tea out on top of that it communicate which be what emotion do emotion be all about act emotion be really about act it be be safe in the world cognition be about understand the world emotion be about interpret it say good bad safe dangerous and get we ready to act which be why the muscle tense or relax and that be why we can tell the emotion of somebody else because they muscle be act subconsciously except that we have evolve to make the facial muscle really rich with emotion well this have emotion if you like because it signal the waiter that hey I be finished see upright and the waiter can come by and say would you like more water it be kind of neat what a wonderful design and the third level be reflective which be if you like the superego it be a little part of the brain that have no control over what you do no control over the do not see the sens do not control the muscle it look over what be go on it be that little voice in you head that be watch and say that be good that be bad or why be you do that I do not understand it be that little voice in you head that be the seat of consciousness here be a great reflective product owner of the Hummer have say you know I have own many car in my life all sort of exotic car but never have I have a car that attract so much attention it be about attention it be about they image not about the car if you want a more positive model this be the GM car and the reason you might buy it now be because you care about the environment and you will buy it to protect the environment even though the first few car be go to be really expensive and not perfect but that be reflective design as well or a expensive watch so you can impress person oh gee I do not know you have that watch as oppose to this one which be a pure behavioral watch which probably keep good time than the 13 000 watch I just show you but it be ugly this be a clear Don Norman watch and what be neat be sometimes you pit one emotion against the other the visceral fear of fall against the reflective state say it be ok it be ok it be safe it be safe if that amusement park be rusty and fall apart you would never go on the ride so it be pit one against the other the other neat thing laughter so Jake Cress be this furniture maker and he make this unbelievable set of furniture and this be he chair with claw and the poor little chair have lose its ball and it be try to get it back before anybody notice and what be so neat about it be how you accept that story and that be what be nice about emotion so that be the new I I be only say positive thing from now on laughter applause
