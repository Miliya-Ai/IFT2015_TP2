I be work a lot with motion and animation and also I be a old DJ and a musician so music video be something that I always find interesting but they always seem to be so reactive so I be think can you remove we as creator and try to make the music be the voice and have the animation follow it so with two designer Tolga and Christina at my office we take a track many of you probably know it it about 25 year old and it be David Byrne and Brian Eno and we do this little animation and I think that it be maybe interesting also that it deal with two problematic issue which be rise water and religion song before God destroy the person on the Earth he warn Noah to build a Ark and after Noah build he Ark I believe he tell Noah to warn the person that they must change all they wicked way before he come upon they and destroy they and when Noah have do build he Ark I understand that somebody begin to rend a song and the song begin to move on I understand like this and when Noah have do build he Ark move on in fact concern so they get tired have come dark and rain they get weary and tired and then he go and knock a old lady house and old lady run to the door and say who be it Jack say I Mama san could we spend the night here because we be far from home we be very tired and the old lady say oh yes come on in it be come dark and rain will make you weary and tired applause
