I become a inventor by accident I be out of the air force in 1956 no no that be not true I go in in 1956 come out in 1959 be work at the University of Washington and I come up with a idea from read a magazine article for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm now that be before cassette tape c d s dvd any of the cool stuff we have get now and it be a arm that instead of hinge and pivot as it go across the record go straight a radial linear tracking tone arm and it be the hard invention I ever make but it get I start and I get really lucky after that and without give you too much of a tirade I want to talk to you about a invention I bring with I today my 44th invention no that be not true either golly I be just totally lose it my 44th patent about the 15th invention I call this hypersonic sound I be go to play it for you in a couple minute but I want to make a analogy before I do to this I usually show this hypersonic sound and person will say that be really cool but what be it good for and I say what be the light bulb good for sound light I be go to draw the analogy when Edison invent the light bulb pretty much look like this have not change that much light come out of it in every direction before the light bulb be invent person have figure out how to put a reflector behind it focus it a little bit put lens in front of it focus it a little bit well ultimately we figure out how to make thing like laser that be totally focused now think about where the world would be today if we have the light bulb but you could not focus light if when you turn one on it just go wherever it want to that be the way loudspeaker pretty much be you turn on the loudspeaker and after almost 80 year of have that gadget the sound just kind of go where it want even when you be stand in front of a megaphone it be pretty much every direction a little bit of differential but not much if the light bulb be the way the speaker be and you could not focus or sharpen the edge or define it we would not have that or movie in general or computer or t v set or c d s or dvd and just go down the list of what the importance be of be able to focus light now after almost 80 year of have sound I think it be about time that we figure out a way to put sound where you want to I have a couple of unit that guy there be make for a demo I do yesterday early in the day for a big car maker in Detroit who want to put they in a car small version over you head so that you can actually get binaural sound in a car what if I could aim sound the way I aim light I get this waterfall I record in my back yard now you be not go to hear a thing unless it hit you maybe if I hit the side wall it will bounce around the room applause the sound be be make right next to you ear be that cool applause because I have some limited time I will cut it off for a second and tell you about how it work and what it be good for course like light it be great to be able to put sound to highlight a clothing rack or the cornflake or the toothpaste or a talk plaque in a movie theater lobby Sony get a idea Sony we big customer right now they try this back in the 60 and be too smart and so they give up but they want to use it seriously there be a mix a inventor have to have you have to be kind of smart and though I do not graduate from college do not mean I be stupid because you can not be stupid and do very much in the world today too many other smart person out there so I just happen to get my education in a little different way I be not at all against education I think it be wonderful I think sometimes person when they get educate lose it they get so smart they be unwilling to look at thing that they know good than and we be live in a great time right now because almost everything be explore anew I have this little slogan that I use a lot which be virtually nothing and I mean this honestly have be invent yet we be just start we be just start to really discover the law of nature and science and physics and this be I hope a little piece of it Sony get this vision back to get myself on track that when you stand in the checkout line in the supermarket you be go to watch a new t v channel they know that when you watch t v at home because there be so many choice you can change channel miss they commercial a hundred and fifty one million person every day stand in the line at the supermarket now they have try this a couple year ago and it fail because the checker get tired of hear the same message every 20 minute and reach out turn off the sound and you know if the sound be not there the sale typically be not make for instance like when you be on a airplane they show the movie you get to watch it for free when you want to hear the sound you pay and so ABC and Sony have devise this new thing where when you step in the line in the supermarket initially it will be Safeways it be Safeways they be try this in three part of the country right now you will be watch tv and hopefully they will be sensitive that they do not want to offend you with just one more outlet but what be great about it from the test that have be do be if you do not want to hear it you take about one step to the side and you do not hear it so we create silence as much as we create sound atm that talk to you nobody else hear it sit in bed two in the morning watch tv you spouse or someone be next to you asleep do not hear it do not wake up we be also work on noise cancel thing like snore noise from automobile I have be really lucky with this technology all of a sudden as it be ready the world be ready to accept it they have literally beat a path to we door we have be sell it since about last September October and it be be immensely gratify if you be interested in what it cost I be not sell they today but this unit with the electronics and everything if you buy one be around a thousand buck we expect by this time next year it will be hundred a few hundred buck to buy it it be not any more pricey than regular electronics now when I play it for you you do not hear the thunderous bass this unit that I play go from about 200 hertz to above the range of hearing it be actually emit ultrasound low level ultrasound that be about 100 000 vibration per second and the sound that you be hear unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound be make on the face be make out in front of it in the air the air be not linear as we have always be teach you turn up the volume just a little bit I be talk about a little over 80 decibel and all of a sudden the air begin to corrupt signal you propagate here be why the speed of sound be not a constant it be fairly slow it change with temperature and with barometric pressure now imagine if you will without get too technical I be make a little sine wave here in the air well if I turn up the amplitude too much I be have a effect on the pressure which mean during the making of that sine wave the speed at which it be propagate be shift all of audio as we know it be a attempt to be more and more perfectly linear linearity mean high quality sound hypersonic sound be exactly the opposite it be 100 percent base on non linearity a effect happen in the air it be a corrupt effect of the sound the ultrasound in this case that be emit but it be so predictable that you can produce very precise audio out of that effect now the question be where be the sound make instead of be make on the face of the cone it be make at literally billion of little independent point along this narrow column in the air and so when I aim it towards you what you hear be make right next to you ear I say we can shorten the column we can spread it out to cover the couch I can put it so that one ear hear one speaker the other ear hear the other that be true binaural sound when you listen to stereo on you home system you both ear hear both speaker turn on the left speaker sometime and notice you be hear it also in you right ear so the stage be more restrict the sound stage that be suppose to spread out in front of you because the sound be make in the air along this column it do not follow the inverse square law which say it drop off about two third every time you double the distance 6db every time you go from one meter for instance to two meter that mean you go to a rock concert or a symphony and the guy in the front row get the same level as the guy in the back row now all of a sudden be not that terrific so we have be as I say very successful very lucky in have company catch the vision of this from car car maker who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kid and a separate system in the back oh no the kid be not drive today laughter I be see if you be listen actually I have not have breakfast yet a stereo system in the front for mom and dad and maybe there be a little dvd player in the back for the kid and the parent do not want to be bother with that or they rap music or whatever so again this idea of be able to put sound anywhere you want to be really start to catch on it also work for transmit and communicate datum it also work five time good underwater we have get the military have just deploy some of this into Iraq where you can put fake troop movement quarter of a mile away on a hillside laughter or you can whisper in the ear of a suppose terrorist some biblical verse laughter I be serious and they have this infrared device that can look at they countenance and see a fraction of a degree Kelvin in temperature shift from 100 yard away when they play this thing and so another way of hopefully determine who be friendly and who be not we make a version with this which put out 155 decibel Pain be 120 so it allow you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with person and there can be a public beach just off to the side and they do not even know it be turn on we sell that to the military presently for about 70 000 dollar and they be buy they as fast as we can make they we put it on a turret with a camera so that when they shoot at you you be over there and it be there I have a bunch of other invention I invent a plasma antenna to shift gear look up at the ceiling of my office one day I be work on a ground penetrate radar project and my physicist ceo come in and say we have a real problem we be use very short wavelength we have get a problem with the antenna ring when you run very short wavelength like a tuning fork the antenna resonate and there be more energy come out of the antenna than there be the backscatter from the ground that we be try to analyze take too much processing I say why do not we make a antenna that only exist when you want it turn it on turn it off that be a fluorescent tube refine I just sell that for a million and a half dollar cash I take it back to the Pentagon after it get declassify when the patent issue and tell the person back there about it and they laugh and then I take they back a demo and they buy laughter any of you ever wear a Jabber headphone the little cell headphone that be my invention I sell that for seven million dollar big mistake it just sell for 80 million dollar two year ago I actually draw that up on a little crummy Mac computer in my Attic at my house and one of the many design which they have now be still the same design I draw way back when so I have be really lucky as a inventor I be the happy guy you be ever go to meet and my dad die before he realize anybody in the family would maybe hopefully make something out of themselves you have be a great audience I know I have jump all over the place I usually figure out what my talk be when I get up in front of a group let I give you in the last minute one more quick demo of this guy for that of you that have not hear it can never tell if it be on if you have not hear it raise you hand get it over there get the cameraman yeah there you go I have get a Coke can opening that be right in you head that be really cool thank you once again appreciate it very much
