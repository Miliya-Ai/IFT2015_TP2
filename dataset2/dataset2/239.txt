this be a work in process base on some comment that be make at TED two year ago about the need for the storage of vaccine video on this planet 1 6 billion person do not have access to electricity refrigeration or store fuel this be a problem it impact the spread of disease the storage of food and medicine and the quality of life so here be the plan inexpensive refrigeration that do not use electricity propane gas kerosene or consumable time for some thermodynamics and the story of the intermittent absorption refrigerator Adam Grosser so 29 year ago I have this thermo teacher who talk about absorption and refrigeration one of that thing that stick in my head a lot like the Stirling engine it be cool but you do not know what to do with it it be invent in 1858 by this guy Ferdinand Carr but he could not actually build anything with it because of the tool at the time this crazy Canadian name Powel Crosley commercialize this thing call the IcyBall in 1928 it be a really neat idea and I will get to why it do not work but here be how it work there be two sphere and they be separate in distance one have a work fluid water and ammonia and the other be a condenser you heat up one side the hot side the ammonia evaporate and it recondens in the other side you let it cool to room temperature and then as the ammonia reevaporate and combine with the water back on the erstwhile hot side it create a powerful cool effect so it be a great idea that do not work at all they blow up laughter because you be use ammonia you get hugely high pressure if you heat they wrong it top 400 psi the ammonia be toxic it spray everywhere but it be kind of a interesting thought so the great thing about 2006 there be a lot of really great computational work you can do so we get the whole thermodynamics department at Stanford involve a lot of computational fluid dynamics we prove that most of the ammonia refrigeration table be wrong we find some nontoxic refrigerant that work at very low vapor pressure we bring in a team from the UK a lot of great refrigeration person it turn out in the UK and build a test rig and prove that in fact we could make a low pressure nontoxic refrigerator so this be the way it work you put it on a cooking fire most person have cook fire in the world whether it be camel dung or wood it heat up for about 30 minute cool for a hour you put it into a container and it will refrigerate for 24 hour it look like this this be the fifth prototype it be not quite done it weigh about eight pound and this be the way it work you put it into a 15 liter vessel about three gallon and it will cool it down to just above freeze three degree above freeze for 24 hour in a 30 degree c environment it be really cheap we think we can build this in high volume for about 25 dollar in low volume for about 40 dollar and we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have thank you applause
