I have actually be wait by the phone for a call from TED for year and in fact in 2000 I be ready to talk about eBay but no call in 2003 I be ready to do a talk about the Skoll Foundation and social entrepreneurship no call in 2004 I start Participant Productions and we have a really good first year and no call and finally I get a call last year and then I have to go up after j j abram laughter you have get a cruel sense of humor TED laughter when I first move to Hollywood from Silicon Valley I have some misgiving but I find that there be some advantage to be in Hollywood laughter and in fact some advantage to own you own media company and I also find that Hollywood and Silicon Valley have a lot more in common than I would have dream Hollywood have its sex symbol and the Valley have its sex symbol laughter Hollywood have its rivalry and the Valley have its rivalry Hollywood gather around power table and the Valley gather around power table so it turn out there be a lot more in common than I would have dream but I be actually here today to tell a story and part of it be a personal story when Chris invite I to speak he say person think of you as a bit of a enigma and they want to know what drive you a bit and what really drive I be a vision of the future that I think we all share it be a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability and when we hear a lot of the presentation over the last couple of day Ed Wilson and the picture of James Nachtwey I think we all realize how far we have to go to get to this new version of humanity that I like to call humanity 2 0 and it be also something that reside in each of we to close what I think be the two big calamity in the world today one be the gap in opportunity this gap that President Clinton last night call uneven unfair and unsustainable and out of that come poverty and illiteracy and disease and all this evil that we see around we but perhaps the other big gap be what we call the hope gap and someone at some point come up with this very bad idea that a ordinary individual could not make a difference in the world and I think that be just a horrible thing and so chapter one really begin today with all of we because within each of we be the power to equal that opportunity gap and to close the hope gap and if the man and woman of TED can not make a difference in the world I do not know who can and for I a lot of this start when I be young and my family use to go camping in upstate New York and there really be not much to do there for the summer except get beat up by my sister or read book and so I use to read author like James Michener and James Clavell and Ayn Rand and they story make the world seem a very small and interconnect place and it strike I that if I could write story that be about this world as be small and interconnect that maybe I could get person interested in the issue that affect we all and maybe engage they to make a difference I do not think that be necessarily the good way to make a living so I decide to go on a path to become financially independent so I could write this story as quickly as I could I then have a bit of a wake up call when I be 14 and my dad come home one day and announce that he have cancer and it look pretty bad and what he say be he be not so much afraid that he might die but that he have not do the thing that he want to with he life and knock on wood he be still alive today many year later but for a young man that make a real impression on I that one never know how much time one really have so I set out in a hurry I study engineering I start a couple of business that I think would be the ticket to financial freedom one of that business be a computer rental business call Micros on the move which be very well name because person keep steal the computer laughter so I figure I need to learn a little bit more about business so I go to Stanford Business School and study there and while I be there I make friend with a fellow name Pierre Omidyar who be here today and Pierre I apologize for this this be a photo from the old day and just after I have graduate Pierre come to I with this idea to help person buy and sell thing online with each other and with the wisdom of my Stanford degree I say Pierre what a stupid idea laughter and needless to say I be right laughter but right after that Pierre in 96 Pierre and I leave we full time job to build eBay as a company and the rest of that story you know the company go public two year late and be today one of the well know company in the world hundred of million of person use it in hundred of country and so on but for I personally it be a real change I go from live in a house with five guy in Palo Alto and live off they leftovers to all of a sudden have all kind of resource and I want to figure out how I could take the blessing of this resource and share it with the world and around that time I meet John Gardner who be a remarkable man he be the architect of the Great Society program under Lyndon Johnson in the 1960 and I ask he what he feel be the good thing I could do or anyone could do to make a difference in the long term issue face humanity and John say bet on good person do good thing bet on good person do good thing and that really resonate with I I start a foundation to bet on this good person do good thing this lead innovative nonprofit folk who be use business skill in a very leveraged way to solve social problem person today we call social entrepreneur and to put a face on it person like Muhammad Yunus who start the Grameen Bank have lift 100 million person plus out of poverty around the world win the Nobel Peace Prize but there be also a lot of person that you do not know folk like Ann Cotton who start a group call camf in Africa because she feel girl education be lag and she start it about 10 year ago and today she educate over a quarter million African girl and somebody like Dr Victoria Hale who start the world first nonprofit pharmaceutical company and whose first drug will be fight visceral leishmaniasis also know as black fever and by 2010 she hope to eliminate this disease which be really a scourge in the develop world and so this be one way to bet on good person do good thing and a lot of this come together in a philosophy of change that I find really be powerful it be what we call Invest connect and celebrate and invest if you see good person do good thing invest in they Invest in they organization or in business Invest in this folk connect they together through conference like a TED bring so many powerful connection or through the World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship that my foundation do at Oxford every year and celebrate they tell they story because not only be there good person do good work but they story can help close this gap of hope and it be this last part of the mission the celebrate part that really get I back to thinking when I be a kid and want to tell story to get person involve in the issue that affect we all and a light bulb go off which be first that I do not actually have to do the writing myself I could find writer and then the next light bulb be good than just write what about film and tv to get out to person in a big way and I think about the film that inspire I film like Gandhi and Schindler list and I wonder who be do this kind of film today and there really be not a specific company that be focus on the public interest so in 2003 I start to make my way around Los Angeles to talk about the idea of a pro social media company and I be meet with a lot of encouragement one of the line of encouragement that I hear over and over be the street of Hollywood be litter with the carcass of person like you who think you be go to come to this town and make movie and then of course there be the other adage the sure way to become a millionaire be to start by be a billionaire and go into the movie business laughter undeterred in January of 2004 I start Participant Productions with the vision to be a global media company focus on the public interest and we mission be to produce entertainment that create and inspire social change and we do not just want person to see we movie and say that be fun and forget about it we want they to actually get involve in the issue in 2005 we launch we first slate of film murder ball North Country Syriana and Good Night and Good Luck and much to my surprise they be notice we end up with 11 Oscar nomination for this film and it turn out to be a pretty good year for this guy perhaps more importantly ten of thousand of person join the advocacy program and the activism program that we create to go around the movie and we have a online component of that we community sect call participate net but with we social sector partner like the ACLU and PBS and the Sierra Club and the NRDC once person see the film there be actually something they could do to make a difference one of this film in particular call North Country be actually kind of a box office disaster but it be a film that star Charlize Theron and it be about woman right woman empowerment domestic violence and so on and we release the film at the same time that the Congress be debate the renewal of the violence against Women Act and with screening on the Hill and discussion and with we social sector partner like the National Organization of Women the film be widely credit with influence the successful renewal of the act and that to I speak volume because it be the film start about a true life story about a woman who be harass sue she employer lead to a landmark case that lead to the Equal Opportunity Act and the violence against Women Act and other and then the movie about this person do this thing then lead to this great renewal and so again it go back to bet on good person do good thing speak of which we fellow TEDster Al I first see Al do he slide show presentation on global warming in May of 2005 at that point I think I know something about global warming I think it be a 30 to 50 year problem and after we see he slide show it become clear that it be much more urgent and so right afterwards I meet backstage with Al and with Lawrence Bender who be there and Laurie David and Davis Guggenheim who be run documentary for participant at the time and with Al blessing we decide on the spot to turn it into a film because we feel that we could get the message out there far more quickly than have Al go around the world speak to audience of 100 or 200 at a time and you know there be another adage in Hollywood that nobody know nothing about anything and I really think this be go to be a straight to pb charitable initiative and so it be a great shock to all of we when the film really capture the public interest and today be mandatory viewing in school in England and Scotland and most of Scandinavia we have send 50 000 dvd to high school teacher in the U S and it be really change the debate on global warming it be also a pretty good year for this guy we now call Al the George Clooney of global warming laughter and for participant this be just the start everything we do look at the major issue in the world and we have 10 film in production right now and dozen other in development I will quickly talk about a few come up one be Charlie Wilson War with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts and it be the true story of Congressman Charlie Wilson and how he fund the Taliban to fight the Russian in Afghanistan and we be also do a movie call the Kite Runner base on the book the Kite Runner also about Afghanistan and we think once person see this film they will have a much good understanding of that part of the world and the Middle East in general we premiere a film call the Chicago 10 at Sundance this year it be base on the protester at the democratic convention in 1968 Abby Hoffman and crew and again a story about a small group of individual who do make change in the world and a documentary that we be do on Jimmy Carter and he Mid East peace effort over the year and in particular we have be follow he on he recent book tour which as many of you know have be very non controversial laughter which be really bad for get person to come see a movie in closing I would like to say that everybody have the opportunity to make change in they own way and all the person in this room have do so through they business live or they philanthropic work or they other interest and one thing that I have learn be that there be never one right way to make change one can do it as a tech person or as a finance person or a nonprofit person or as a entertainment person but every one of we be all of that thing and more and I believe if we do this thing we can close the opportunity gap we can close the hope gap and I can imagine if we do this the headline in 10 year might read something like this New AIDS case in Africa fall to zero U S Imports its last barrel of oil applause Israeli and Palestinian celebrate 10 year of peaceful coexistence applause and I like this one Snow have Returned to Kilimanjaro laughter and finally a eBay list for one well travel slide show now obsolete museum piece please contact Al Gore and I believe that work together we can make all of this thing happen and I want to thank you all for have I here today it be be a real honor thank you applause oh thank you
