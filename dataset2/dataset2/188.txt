I be a historian Steve tell we about the future of little technology I be go to show you some of the past of big technology this be a project to build a 4 000 ton nuclear bomb propel spaceship and go to Saturn and Jupiter this take place in my childhood 1957 65 it be deeply classified I be go to show you some stuff that not only have not be declassify but have now be reclassify laughter if all go well next year I will be back and I will have a lot more to show you and if all do not go well I will be in jail like Wen Ho Lee laughter so this ship be basically the size of the Marriott Hotel a little tall and a little big and one of the person who work on it at the beginning be my father Freeman there in the middle that be I and my sister Esther who be a frequent tedster I do not like nuclear bomb propel spaceship I mean I think it be a great idea but I start build kayak so we have a few kayak just so you know that I be not Dr Strangelove but all the time I be out there do this strange kayak voyage in odd beautiful part of this planet I always think in the back of my mind about Project Orion and how my father and he friend be go to build this big ship they be actually go to go Ted Taylor who lead the project be go to take he child my father be not go to take he child that be one of the reason we sort of have a fall out for a few year laughter the project begin in 57 at General Atomics there that be right on the coast at La Jolla look at that central building right in the middle of the picture that be the 130 foot diameter library that be exactly the size of the base of the spaceship so put that library at the bottom of that ship that be how big the thing be go to be it would take two or three thousand bomb the person who work on it be a lot of the Los Alamos person who have do the hydrogen bomb work it be the first project fund by ARPA that be the contract where ARPA give the first million dollar to get this thing start Spaceship project officially begin Job wait for you Dyson that be July 58 two day late the space traveler manifesto explain why just like we hear yesterday why we need to go into space trip to satellite of the outer planet August 20 1958 this be the statistics of what would be the good place to go and stop some of the size of the ship range all the way up to ship mass of 8 million ton so that be the outer extreme here be version two 2 000 bomb this be five kiloton yield bomb about the size of small Volkswagens it would take 800 to get into orbit here we see a 10 000 ton ship will deliver 1 300 ton to Saturn and back essentially a five year trip possible departure date October 1960 to February 1967 this be trajectory go to Mars all this be do by hand with slide rule the little Orion ship and what it would take to do what Orion do with chemical you have a ship the size of the Empire State Building NASA have no interest they try to kill the project the person who support it be the Air Force which mean that it be all secret and that be why when you get something declassify that be what it look like military weapon version that carry hydrogen bomb that could destroy half the planet there be another version there that send retaliatory strike at the Soviet Union this be the really secret stuff how to get direct energy explosion so you be send the energy of a nuclear explosion not like just a stick of dynamite but you be direct it at the ship and this be still a very active subject it be quite dangerous but I believe it be good to have dangerous thing in the open than think you be go to keep they secret this be what happen at 600 microsecond the Air Force start to build small model and actually start do this the guy in La Jolla say we have get to get start now they build a high explosive propel model this be still from film footage that be save by someone who be suppose to destroy it but do not and keep it in they basement for the last 40 year so this be three pound charge of c4 that be about 10 time what the guy have in he shoe laughter this be Ed Day put so each of this coffee can have three pound of c4 in it they be build a system that eject this at quarter second interval that be my dad in the sport coat there hold the briefcase so they have a lot of fun do this but no child be allow my dad could tell I he be build a spaceship and go to go to Saturn but he could not say anything more about it so all my life I have want to find this stuff out and spend the last four year track this old guy down this be still from the video Jeff Bezos kindly yesterday say he will put this video up on the Amazon site some little clip of it applause so thanks to he they get quite serious about the engineering of this the size of that mass for we be really large technology in a way we be never go to go back to if you see the 1959 this be what it would feel like in the passenger compartment that be acceleration profile laughter and pulse system yield we be look at 20 kiloton yield for a effective thrust of 10 million newton well here we have a little problem the radiation dose at the crew station 700 rad per shot laughter fission yield during development they be hope to get clean bomb they do not eyeburn this be what happen to the person in Miami who be look up laughter personnel compartment noise that be not too bad it be very low frequency it be basically like this sub woofer and now we have grind hazard assessment when you have a blow up on the pad finally at the very end in 1964 NASA step in and say ok we will support a feasibility study for a small version that could be launch with Saturn vs in section and piece together so this be what NASA do get a eight man version that would go to Mars they like it because the guy could kind of live there and be like it be like live in a submarine this be crew compartment it switch so what be upside down be right side up when you go to artificial gravity mode the scientist be still go to go along they would take seven astronaut and seven scientist this be a 20 man version for go to Jupiter bunk storm cellar exercise room you know it be go to be a nice long trip the Air Force version here we have a military version this be the kind of stuff that be not be declassify just that person manage to sneak home and after you know on they deathbed basically give I that the sort of artist conception this be basically powerpoint presentation give to the Air Force 40 year ago look at the little guy there outside the vehicle and one part of NASA be interested in it but the headquarters in NASA they kill the project so finally at the end we can see the thing follow its sort of design path right up to 1965 and then all that path come to a halt result none this project be hereby terminate so that be the end all I can say in closing be we hear yesterday that one of the 10 bad thing that could happen to we be a asteroid with we name on it and one of the bad thing that could happen to NASA be if that asteroid show up with we name on it nine month out and everybody say well what be we go to do and Orion be really one of the only if not the only off the shelf technology that could do something laughter so I be go to tell you the good news and the bad news the good news be that NASA have a small secret contingency plan division that be look at this try to keep knowledge of Orion preserve in the event of such a misfortune maybe keep a few little bomb of plutonium on the side that be the good news the bad news be when I get in contact with this person to try and get some document from they they go crazy because I have all this stuff that they do not have and NASA purchase 1 759 page of this stuff from I so that be the state we be at it be not very good laughter applause
