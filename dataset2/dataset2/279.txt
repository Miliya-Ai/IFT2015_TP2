well good morning you know the computer and television both recently turn 60 and today I would like to talk about they relationship despite they middle age if you have be follow the theme of this conference or the entertainment industry it be pretty clear that one have be pick on the other so it be about time that we talk about how the computer ambush television or why the invention of the atomic bomb unleash force that lead to the writer strike and it be not just what this be do to each other but it be what the audience think that really frame this matter to get a sense of this and it be be a theme we have talk about all week I recently talk to a bunch of tweener I write on card television radio MySpace Internet pc and I say just arrange this from what be important to you and what be not and then tell I why let listen to what happen when they get to the portion of the discussion on television video girl 1 well I think it be important but like not necessary because you can do a lot of other stuff with you free time than watch program Peter Hirshberg which be more fun internet or tv girl internet girl 2 I think we the reason one of the reason we put computer before tv be because nowadays like we have tv show on the computer girl 3 oh yeah girl 2 and then you can download onto you ipod PH would you like to be the president of a tv network girl 4 I would not like it girl 2 that would be so stressful girl 5 no PH how come girl 5 because they be go to lose all they money eventually girl 3 like the stock market it go up and down and stuff I think right now the computer will be at the top and everything will be kind of go down and stuff PH there be be a uneasy relationship between the tv business and the tech business really ever since they both turn about 30 we go through period of enthrallment follow by reaction in boardroom in the finance community good characterize as what be the finance term ick pooey let I give you a example of this the year be 1976 and Warner buy Atari because video game be on the rise the next year they march forward and they introduce Qube the first interactive cable tv system and the New York Times herald this as telecommunications move to the home convergence great thing be happen everybody in the East Coast get in the picture Citicorp Penney RCA all get into this big vision by the way this be about when I enter the picture I be go to do a summer internship at Time Warner that summer I be all I be at Warner that summer I be all excited to work on convergence and then the bottom fall out do not work out too well for they they lose money and I have a happy brush with convergence until kind of Warner basically have to liquidate the whole thing that be when I leave graduate school and I can not work in New York on kind of entertainment and technology because I have to be exile to California where the remain job be almost to the sea to go to work for Apple Computer Warner of course write off more than 400 million dollar four hundred million dollar which be real money back in the 70 but they be onto something and they get good at it by the year 2000 the process be perfect they merge with AOL and in just four year manage to shed about 200 billion dollar of market capitalization show that they have actually master the art of apply Moore law of successive miniaturization to they balance sheet laughter now I think that one reason that the media and the entertainment community or the media community be drive so crazy by the tech community be that tech folk talk differently you know for 50 year we have talk about change the world about total transformation for 50 year it be be about hope and fear and promise of a good world and I get to think you know who else talk that way and the answer be pretty clearly it be person in religion and in politics and so I realize that actually the tech world be good understand not as a business cycle but as a messianic movement we promise something great we evangelize it we be go to change the world it do not work out too well and so we actually go back to the well and start all over again as the person in New York and L A look on in absolute morbid astonishment but it be this irrational view of thing that drive we on to the next thing so what I would like to ask be if the computer be become a principal tool of media and entertainment how do we get here I mean how do a machine that be build for accounting and artillery morph into media of course the first computer be build just after World War II to solve military problem but thing get really interesting just a couple of year later 1949 with whirlwind build at MIT Lincoln Lab Jay Forrester be build this for the Navy but you can not help but see that the creator of this machine have in mind a machine that might actually be a potential media star so take a look at what happen when the foremost journalist of early television meet one of the foremost computer pioneer and the computer begin to express itself video journalist it be a whirlwind electronic computer with considerable trepidation we undertake to interview this new machine Jay Forrester Hello New York this be Cambridge and this be the oscilloscope of the Whirlwind electronic computer would you like if I use the machine Journalist Yes of course but I have a idea Mr Forrester since this computer be make in conjunction with the Office of Naval Research why do not we switch down to the Pentagon in Washington and let the Navy research chief Admiral Bolster give Whirlwind the workout Calvin Bolster Well Ed this problem concern the Navy vike rocket this rocket go up 135 mile into the sky now at the standard rate of fuel consumption I would like to see the computer trace the flight path of this rocket and see how it can determine at any instant say at the end of 40 second the amount of fuel remain and the velocity at that set instant JF Over on the left hand side you will notice fuel consumption decrease as the rocket take off and on the right hand side there be a scale that show the rocket velocity the rocket position be show by the trajectory that we be now look at and as it reach the peak of its trajectory the velocity you will notice have drop off to a minimum then as the rocket dive down velocity pick up again toward a maximum velocity and the rocket hit the ground how be that journalist what about that Admiral CB look very good to I jf and before leave we would like to show you another kind of mathematical problem that some of the boy have work out in they spare time in a less serious vein for a Sunday afternoon music journalist thank you very much indeed Mr Forrester and the MIT lab PH you know so much be work out the first real time interaction the video display point a gun it lead to the microcomputer but unfortunately it be too pricey for the Navy and all of this would have be lose if it be not for a happy coincidence enter the atomic bomb we be threaten by the great weapon ever and know a good thing when it see it the Air Force decide it need the big computer ever to protect we they adapt whirlwind to a massive air defense system deploy it all across the frozen north and spend nearly three time as much on this computer as be spend on the Manhattan Project build the a bomb in the first place talk about a shot in the arm for the computer industry and you can imagine that the Air Force become a pretty good salesman here be they market video video narrator in a mass raid high speed bomber could be in on we before we could determine they track and then it would be too late to act we can not afford to take that chance it be to meet this threat that the Air Force have be develop sage the Semi Automatic Ground Environment system to strengthen we air defen this new computer build to become the nerve center of a defense network be able to perform all the complex mathematical problem involve in counter a mass enemy raid it be provide with its own powerhouse contain large diesel drive generator air conditioning equipment and cool tower require to cool the thousand of vacuum tube in the computer PH you know that one computer be huge there be a interesting marketing lesson from it which be basically when you market a product you can either say this be go to be wonderful it will make you feel well and enliven you or there be one other marketing proposition if you do not use we product you will die this be a really good example of that this have the first point device it be distribute so it work out distribute computing and modem so all this thing could talk to each other about 20 percent of all the nation programmer be wrap up in this thing and it lead to a awful lot of what we have today it also use vacuum tube you see how huge it be and to give you a sense for this because we have talk a lot about Moore law and make thing small at this conference so let talk about make thing large if we take whirlwind and put it in a place that you all know say Century City it would fit beautifully you would kind of have to take Century City out but it could fit in there but like let imagine we take the late Pentium processor the late core 2 Extreme which be a four core processor that Intel work on it will be we laptop tomorrow to build that what we have do with whirlwind technology be we have have to take up roughly from the 10 to Mulholland and from the 405 to La Cienega just with that whirlwind and then the 92 nuclear power plant that it would take to provide the power would fill up the rest of Los Angeles that be roughly a third more nuclear power than all of France create so the next time they tell you they be on to something clearly they be not so and we have not even work out the cool need but it give you the kind of power that person have that the audience have and the reason this transformation be happen all of this stuff start move into industry DEC kind of reduce all this and make the first mini computer it show up at place like MIT and then a mutation happen Spacewar be build the first computer game and all of a sudden interactivity and involvement and passion be work out actually many mit student stay up all night long work on this thing and many of the principle of gaming today be work out DEC know a good thing about waste time it ship every one of its computer with that game meanwhile as all of this be happen by the mid 50 the business model of traditional broadcasting and cinema have be busted completely a new technology have confound radio man and movie mogul and they be quite certain that television be about to do they in in fact despair be in the air and a quote that sound largely reminiscent from everything I have be read all week RCA have David Sarnoff who basically commercialize radio say this I do not say that radio network must die every effort have be make and will continue to be make to find a new pattern new sell arrangement and new type of program that may arrest the decline revenue it may yet be possible to eke out a poor existence for radio but I do not know how and of course as the computer industry develop interactively producer in the emerge tv business actually hit on the same idea and they fake it Video Jack Berry Boys and girl I think you all know how to get you magic window up on the set you just get they out first of all get you Winky Dink kit out put out you magic window and you erase glove and rub it like this that be the way we get some of the magic into it boy and girl then take it and put it right up against the screen of you own television set and rub it out from the center to the corner like this make sure you keep you magic crayon handy you Winky Dink crayon and you erase glove because you will be use they during the show to draw like that you all set ok let get right to the first story about Dusty Man come on into the secret lab PH it be the dawn of interactive tv and you may have notice they want to sell you the Winky Dink kit that be the Winky Dink crayon I know what you be say Pete I could use any ordinary open source crayon why do I have to buy theirs I assure you that be not the case turn out they tell we directly that this be the only crayon you should ever use with you Winky Dink Magic Window other crayon may discolor or hurt the window this proprietary principle of vendor lock in would go on to be perfect with great success as one of the endure principle of window system everywhere it lead to lawsuit laughter federal investigation and lot of repercussion and that be a scandal we will not discuss today but we will discuss this scandal because this man Jack Berry the host of Winky Dink go on to become the host of twenty one one of the most important quiz show ever and it be rig and it become unravel when this man Charles van Doren be out after a unnatural win streak end berry career and actually end the career of a lot of person at CBS it turn out there be a lot to learn about how this new medium work and 50 year ago if you have be at a meeting like this and be try to understand the media there be one prophet and only but one you want to hear from Professor Marshall McLuhan he actually understand something about a theme that we have be discuss all week it be the role of the audience in a era of pervasive electronic communication here he be talk from the 1960 video Marshall McLuhan if the audience can become involved in the actual process of make the ad then it be happy it be like the old quiz show they be great tv because it give the audience a role something to do they be horrify when they discover they would really be leave out all the time because the show be rig now then this be a horrible misunderstanding of tv on the part of the programmer PH you know McLuhan talk about the global village if you substitute the word blogosphere of the internet today it be very true that he understand be probably very enlightening now let listen in to he Video MM the global village be a world in which you do not necessarily have harmony you have extreme concern with everybody else business and much involvement in everybody else life it be a sort of Ann Landers column writ large and it do not necessarily mean harmony and peace and quiet but it do mean huge involvement in everybody else affair and so the global village be as big as a planet and as small as a village post office PH we will talk a little bit more about he later we be now right into the 1960 it be the era of big business and datum center for compute but all that be about to change you know the expression of technology reflect the person and the time of the culture it be build in and when I say that code express we hope and aspiration it be not just a joke about messianism it be actually what we do but for this part of the story I would actually like to throw it to America lead technology correspondent John Markoff Video John Markoff do you want to know what the counterculture in drug sex rock n roll and the anti war movement have to do with compute everything it all happen within five mile of where I be stand at Stanford University between 1960 and 1975 in the midst of revolution in the street and rock and roll concert in the park a group of researcher lead by person like John McCarthy a computer scientist at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab and Doug Engelbart a computer scientist at SRI change the world Engelbart come out of a pretty dry engineering culture but while he be begin to do he work all of this stuff be bubble on the mid peninsula there be lsd leak out of Kesey Veterans hospital experiment and other area around the campus and there be music literally in the street the Grateful Dead be play in the pizza parlor person be leave to go back to the land there be the Vietnam War there be black liberation there be woman liberation this be a remarkable place at a remarkable time and into that ferment come the microprocessor I think it be that interaction that lead to personal computing they see this tool that be control by the establishment as one that could actually be liberate and put to use by this community that they be try to build and most importantly they have this ethos of share information I think this idea be difficult to understand because when you be trap in one paradigm the next paradigm be always like a science fiction universe it make no sense the story be so compelling that I decide to write a book about they the title of the book be what the Dormouse Said how the 60 counterculture shape the Personal Computer Industry the title be take from the lyric to a Jefferson airplane song the lyric go remember what the dormouse say feed you head feed you head feed you head music PH by this time computing have kind of leapt into media territory and in short order much of what we be do today be imagine in Cambridge and Silicon Valley here be the Architecture Machine Group the predecessor of the media lab in 1981 meanwhile in California we be try to commercialize a lot of this stuff HyperCard be the first program to introduce the public to hyperlink where you could randomly hook to any kind of picture or piece of text or datum across a file system and we have no way of explain it there be no metaphor be it a database a prototype tool a script language heck it be everything so we end up write a marketing brochure we ask a question about how the mind work and we let we customer play the role of so many blind man fill out the elephant a few year later we then hit on the idea of explain to person the secret of how do you get the content you want the way you want it and the easy way here be the Apple marketing video video James Burke you will be pleased to know I be sure that there be several way to create a HyperCard interactive video the most involved method be to go ahead and produce you own videodisc as well as build you own HyperCard stack by far the simple method be to buy a pre make videodisc and HyperCard stack from a commercial supplier the method we illustrate in this video use a pre make videodisc but create custom HyperCard stack this method allow you to use exist videodisc material in way which suit you specific need and interest PH I hope you realize how subversive that be that be like a Dick Cheney speech you think he be a nice bald guy but he be just declare war on the content business find the commercial stuff mash it up tell the story you way now as long as we confine this to the education market and a personal matter between the computer and the file system that be fine but as you can see it be about to leap out and upset Jack Valenti and a lot of other person by the way speak of the filing system it never occur to we that this hyperlink could go beyond the local area network a few year late Tim Berners Lee work that out it become a killer app of link and today of course we call that the world wide web now not only be I instrumental in help Apple miss the internet but a couple of year later I help Bill Gates do the same thing the year be 1993 and he be work on a book and I be work on a video to help he kind of explain where we be all head and how to popularize all this we be plenty aware that we be mess with media and on the surface it look like we predict a lot of the right thing but we also miss a awful lot let take a look video narrator the pyramid the Colosseum the New York subway system and tv dinner ancient and modern wonder of the man make world all yet each pale to insignificance with the completion of that magnificent accomplishment of twenty first century technology the Digital Superhighway once it be only a dream of technoid and a few long forget politician the Digital Highway arrive in America live room late in the twentieth century let we recall the pioneer who make this technical marvel possible the Digital Highway would follow the rutted trail first blaze by Alexander Graham Bell though some be incredulous man 1 the phone company Narrator stir by the prospects of mass communication and make big buck on advertising David Sarnoff commercialize radio man 2 never have scientist be put under such pressure and demand narrator the medium introduce America to new product Voice 1 say mom Windows for Radio mean more enjoyment and great ease of use for the whole family be sure to enjoy Windows for Radio at home and at work narrator in 1939 the Radio Corporation of America introduce television man 2 never have scientist be put under such pressure and demand narrator eventually the race to the future take on add momentum with the breakup of the telephone company and further stimulus come with the deregulation of the cable television industry and the re regulation of the cable television industry Ted Turner we do the work to build this this cable industry now the broadcaster want some of we money I mean it be ridiculous Narrator Computers once the unwieldy tool of accountant and other geek escape the backroom to enter the media fracas the world and all its culture reduce to bit the lingua franca of all media and the force of convergence explode finally four great industrial sector combine Telecommunications entertainment computing and everything else man 3 we will see channel for the gourmet and we will see channel for the pet lover Voice 2 Next on the gourmet pet channel decorate birthday cake for you schnauzer Narrator all of industry be in play as investor flock to place they bet at stake the battle for you the consumer and the right to spend billion to send a lot of information into the parlor of America Music PH we miss a lot you know you miss we miss the internet the long tail the role of the audience open system social network it just go to show how tough it be to come up with the right use of media Thomas Edison have the same problem he write a list of what the phonograph might be good for when he invent it and kind of only one of he idea turn out to have be the right early idea well you know where we be go on from here we come into the era of the dotcom the world wide web and I do not need to tell you about that because we all go through that bubble together but when we emerge from this and what we call web 2 0 thing actually be quite different and I think it be the reason that tv so challenge if internet one be about page now it be about person it be a customer it be a audience it be a person who be participate it be the formidable thing that be change entertainment now Video MM because it give the audience a role something to do PH in my own company Technorati we see something like 67 000 blog post a hour come in that be about 2 700 fresh connective link across about 112 million blog that be out there and it be no wonder that as we head into the writer strike odd thing happen you know it remind I of that old saw in Hollywood that a producer be anyone who know a writer I now think a network boss be anyone who have a cable modem but it be not a joke this be a real headline website attract striking writer operator of site like MyDamnChannel com could benefit from labor dispute meanwhile you have the tv blogger go out on strike in sympathy with the television writer and then you have tv guide a Fox property which be about to sponsor the online video award but cancel it out of sympathy with traditional television not appear to gloat to show you how schizophrenic this all be here be the head of MySpace or Fox Interactive a News Corp company be ask well with the writer strike be not this go to hurt News Corp and help you online video man but I yeah I think there be a opportunity as the strike continue there be a opportunity for more person to experience video on place like MySpace TV PH oh but then he remember he work for Rupert Murdoch Video Man yes well first you know I be part of News Corporation as part of Fox Entertainment Group obviously we hope that the strike be that the issue be resolve as quickly as possible PH one of the great thing that be go on here be the globalization of content really be happen here be a clip from a video from a piece of animation that be write by a writer in Hollywood animation work out in Israel farm out to Croatia and India and it be now a international series Video Narrator the follow take place between the minute of 2 15 p m and 2 18 p m in the month precede the presidential primary Voice 1 you will have to stay here in the safe house until we get word the terrorist threat be over Voice 2 you mean we will have to live here together Voices 2 3 and 4 with she Voice 2 well there go the neighborhood PH the company that create this Aniboom be a interesting example of where this be head traditional tv animation cost say between 80 000 and 10 000 dollar a minute they be produce thing for between 1 500 and 800 dollar a minute and they be offer they creator 30 percent of the back end in a much more entrepreneurial manner so it be a different model what the entertainment business be struggle with the world of brand be figure out for example Nike now understand that Nike plus be not just a device in its shoe it be a network to hook its customer together and the head of marketing at Nike say person be come to we site a average of three time a week we do not have to go to they which mean television advertising be down 57 percent for Nike or as Nike head of marketing say we be not in the business of keep media company alive we be in the business of connect with consumer and media company realize the audience be important also here be a man announce the new market watch from Dow Jones powered 100 percent by the user experience on the home page user generate content marry up with traditional content it turn out you have a big audience and more interest if you hook up with they or as Geoffrey Moore once tell I it be intellectual curiosity that be the trade that brand need in the age of the blogosphere and I think this be begin to happen in the entertainment business one of my hero be songwriter Ally Willis who just write the Color Purple and have be a r and rhythm and blues writer and this be what she say about where songwrit be go Ally Willis where million of collaborator want the song because to look at they strictly as spam be miss what this medium be about PH so to wrap up I would love to throw it back to Marshall McLuhan who 40 year ago be deal with audience that be go through just as much change and I think that today traditional Hollywood and the writer be frame this perhaps in the way that it be be frame before but I do not need to tell you this let throw it back to he Video Narrator we be in the middle of a tremendous clash between the old and the new MM the medium do thing to person and they be always completely unaware of this they do not really notice the new medium that be wrap they up they think of the old medium because the old medium be always the content of the new medium as movie tend to be the content of tv and as book use to be the content novel use to be the content of movie and so every time a new medium arrive the old medium be the content and it be highly observable highly noticeable but the real real roughing up and massage be do by the new medium and it be ignore PH I think it be a great time of enthrallment there be be more raw dna of communication and media throw out there content be move from show to particle that be bat back and forth and part of social communication and I think this be go to be a time of great renaissance and opportunity and whereas television may have get beat up what be get build be a really exciting new form of communication and we kind of have the merger of the two industry and a new way of think to look at it thanks very much
