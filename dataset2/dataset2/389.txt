back in 1992 I start work for a company call interval research which be just then be find by David Lidell and Paul Allen as a for profit research enterprise in Silicon Valley I meet with David to talk about what I might do in he company I be just come out of a fail virtual reality business and support myself by be on the speak circuit and writing book after twenty year or so in the computer game industry have idea that person do not think they could sell and David and I discover that we have a question in common that we really want the answer to and that be why have not anybody build any computer game for little girl why be that it can not just be a giant sexist conspiracy this person be not that smart there be six billion dollar on the table they would go for it if they could figure out how so what be the deal here and as we think about we goal I should say that interval be really a humanistic institution in the classical sense that humanism at its good find a way to combine clear eyed empirical research with a set of core value that fundamentally love and respect person the basic idea of humanism be the improvable quality of life that we can do good thing that there be thing worth do because they be good thing to do and that clear eyed empiricism can help we figure out how to do they so contrary to popular belief there be not a conflict of interest between empiricism and value and interval research be kind of the live example of how that can be true so David and I decide to go find out through the good research we could muster what it would take to get a little girl to put she hand on a computer to achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technology that little boy have because they play video game we spend two and a half year conduct research we spend another year and a half in advance development then we form a spin off company in the research phase of the project at interval we partner with a company call Cheskin Research and this person Davis Masten and Christopher Ireland change my mind entirely about what market research be and what it could be they teach I how to look and see and they do not do the incredibly stupid thing of say to a child of all this thing we already make you which do you like good which give you zero answer that be usable so what we do for the first two and a half year be four thing we do a extensive review of the literature in related field like cognitive psychology spatial cognition gender study play theory sociology primatology thank you Frans de Waal wherever you be I love you and I would give anything to meet you after we have do that with a pretty large team of person and discover what we think the salient issue be with girl and boy and play because after all that be really what this be about we move to the second phase of we work where we interview adult expert in academia some of the person who have produce the literature that we find relevant also we do focus group with person who be on the ground with kid every day like playground supervisor we talk to they confirm some hypothesis and identify some serious question about gender difference and play then we do what I consider to be the heart of the work interview 1 100 child boy and girl age seven to 12 all over the United States except for Silicon Valley Boston and Austin because we know that they little family would have million of computer in they and they would not be a representative sample and at the end of that remarkable conversation with kid and they good friend across the United States after two year we pull together some survey datum from another 10 000 child draw up a set up of what we think be the key finding of we research and spend another year transform they into design heuristic for design computer base product and in fact any kind of product for little girl age eight to 12 and we spend that time design interactive prototype for computer software and test they with little girl in 1996 in November we form the company Purple Moon which be a spinoff of interval research and we chief investor be interval research Vulcan Northwest Institutional Venture Partners and Allen and Company we launch a website on September 2nd that have now serve 25 million page and have 42 000 register young girl user they visit a average of one and a half time a day spend a average of 35 minute a visit and look at 50 page a visit so we feel that we have form a successful online community with girl we launch two title in October Rockett New School the first of a series of product be about a character call Rockett begin she first day of school in eighth grade at a brand new place with a blank slate which allow girl to play with the question of what will I be like when I be old what be it go to be like to be in high school or junior high school who be my friend to exercise the love of social complexity and the narrative intelligence that drive most of they play behavior and which embed in it value about notice that we have lot of choice in we life and the way that we conduct ourselves the other title that we launch be call Secret Paths in the forest which address the more fantasy orient inner life of girl this two title both show up in the top 50 entertainment title in PC Data entertainment title in PC Data in December right up there with John Madden Football which thrill I to death so we be real and we have touch several hundred of thousand of little girl we have make half a billion impression with marketing and pr for this brand Purple Moon ninety six percent of they roughly have be positive four percent of they have be other I want to talk about the other because the politics of this enterprise in a way have be the most fascinating part of it for I there be really two kind of negative review that we have receive one kind of reviewer be a male gamer who think he know what game ought to be and will not show the product to little girl the other kind of reviewer be a certain flavor of feminist who think they know what little girl ought to be and so it be funny to I that this interesting odd bedfellow have one thing in common they do not listen to little girl they have not look at child and they be certainly not demonstrate any love for they I would like to play you some voice of little girl from the two and a half year of research that we do actually some of the voice be more recent and this voice will be accompany by photograph that they take for we of they life of the thing that they value and care about this be picture the girl themselves never see but they give to we this be the stuff that reviewer do not know about and be not listen to and this be the kind of research I recommend to that who want to do humanistic work girl 1 yeah my character be usually a tomboy hers be more into boy girl 2 uh yeah girl 1 we have in the very beginning of the whole game always we do this we each have a piece of paper we write down we name we age be we rich very rich not rich poor medium wealthy boyfriend dog pet what else sister brother and all that girl 2 divorce parent divorce maybe girl 3 this be my pretend unclear one girl 4 we make a school newspaper on the computer girl 5 for a girl game also usually they will have really pretty scenery with cloud and flower girl 6 like if you be a girl and you be really adventurous and a real big tomboy you would think that girl game be kinda sissy girl 7 I run track I play soccer I play basketball and I love a lot of thing to do and sometimes I feel like I can not really enjoy myself unless it be like a vacation like when I get Mondays and all that day off Girl 8 Well sometimes there be a lot of stuff go on because I have music lesson and I be on swim team all this different stuff that I have to do and sometimes it get overwhelming girl 9 my friend Justine kinda take my friend Kelly and now they be be mean to I girl 10 well sometimes it get annoying when you brother and sister or brother or sister when they copy you and you get you idea first and they take you idea and they do it themselves Girl 11 because my old sister she get everything and like when I ask my mom for something she will say no all the time but she give my sister everything Brenda Laurel I want to show you real quickly just a minute of Rockett tricky decision which go gold two day ago let hope it be really stable this be the second day in Rockett life the reason I be show you this be I be hope that the scene that I be go to show you will look familiar and sound familiar now that you have listen to some girl voice and you can see how we have try to incorporate the issue that matter to they in the game that we have create Miko Hey Rockett C mere Rockett Hi Miko what be go on Miko do you hear about Nakilia big Halloween party this weekend she ask I to make sure you know about it Nakilia invite Reuben too but Rockett but what be not he come Miko I do not think so I mean I hear he band be play at another party the same night Rockett really what other party Girl Max party be go to be so cool Whitney he be invite all the good person bl I be go to fast forward to the decision point because I know I do not have a lot of time after this awful event occur Rocket get to decide how she feel about it Rockett who have want to show up at that party anyway I could get invite to that party any day if I want to gee I doubt I will make Max good person list bl ok so we be go to emotionally navigate if we be play the game that be what we have do if at any time during the game we want to learn more about the character we can go into this hidden hallway and I will quickly just show you the interface we can for example go find Miko locker and get some more information about she oops I turn the wrong way but you get the general idea of the product I want to show you the way innocuous as they seem in which we be incorporate what we have learn about girl they desire to experience great emotional flexibility and to play around with the social complexity of they life I want to make the point that what we be give girl I think through this effort be a kind of validation a sense of be see and a sense of the choice that be available in they life we love they we see they we be not try to tell they who they ought to be but we be really really happy about who they be it turn out they be really great I want to close by show you a videotape that be a version of a future game in the Rockett series that we graphic artist and design person put together that we feel would please that four percent of reviewer Rockett 28 Rockett it be like I be just wake up you know bl thanks
