when you have 21 minute to speak two million year seem like a really long time but evolutionarily two million year be nothing and yet in two million year the human brain have nearly triple in mass go from the one and a quarter pound brain of we ancestor here Habilis to the almost three pound meatloaf that everybody here have between they ear what be it about a big brain that nature be so eager for every one of we to have one well it turn out when brain triple in size they do not just get three time big they gain new structure and one of the main reason we brain get so big be because it get a new part call the frontal lobe particularly a part call the pre frontal cortex what do a pre frontal cortex do for you that should justify the entire architectural overhaul of the human skull in the blink of evolutionary time it turn out the pre frontal cortex do lot of thing but one of the most important thing it do be a experience simulator pilot practice in flight simulator so that they do not make real mistake in plane human being have this marvelous adaptation that they can actually have experience in they head before they try they out in real life this be a trick that none of we ancestor could do and that no other animal can do quite like we can it be a marvelous adaptation it be up there with opposable thumb and stand upright and language as one of the thing that get we species out of the tree and into the shopping mall laughter all of you have do this Ben and Jerry do not have liver and onion ice cream and it be not because they whip some up try it and go Yuck it be because without leave you armchair you can simulate that flavor and say yuck before you make it let see how you experience simulator be work Let just run a quick diagnostic before I proceed with the rest of the talk here be two different future that I invite you to contemplate you can try to simulate they and tell I which one you think you might prefer one of they be win the lottery this be about 314 million dollar and the other be become paraplegic laughter just give it a moment of thought you probably do not feel like you need a moment of thought interestingly there be datum on this two group of person datum on how happy they be and this be exactly what you expect be not it but this be not the datum I make this up this be the datum you fail the pop quiz and you be hardly five minute into the lecture because the fact be that a year after lose the use of they leg and a year after win the lotto lottery winner and paraplegic be equally happy with they life do not feel too bad about fail the first pop quiz because everybody fail all of the pop quiz all of the time the research that my laboratory have be do that economist and psychologist around the country have be do have reveal something really quite startling to we something we call the impact bias which be the tendency for the simulator to work badly for the simulator to make you believe that different outcome be more different than in fact they really be from field study to laboratory study we see that win or lose a election gain or lose a romantic partner get or not get a promotion pass or not pass a college test on and on have far less impact less intensity and much less duration than person expect they to have this almost floor I a recent study show how major life trauma affect person suggest that if it happen over three month ago with only a few exception it have no impact whatsoever on you happiness why because happiness can be synthesize Sir Thomas Brown write in 1642 I be the happy man alive I have that in I that can convert poverty to riches adversity to prosperity I be more invulnerable than Achilles fortune have not one place to hit I what kind of remarkable machinery do this guy have in he head well it turn out it be precisely the same remarkable machinery that all off we have human being have something that we might think of as a psychological immune system a system of cognitive process largely non conscious cognitive process that help they change they view of the world so that they can feel good about the world in which they find themselves like Sir Thomas you have this machine unlike Sir Thomas you seem not to know it we synthesize happiness but we think happiness be a thing to be find now you do not need I to give you too many example of person synthesize happiness I suspect though I be go to show you some experimental evidence you do not have to look very far for evidence I take a copy of the New York Times and try to find some instance of person synthesize happiness here be three guy synthesize happiness I be good off physically financially mentally I do not have one minute regret it be a glorious experience I believe it turn out for the good who be this character who be so damn happy the first one be Jim Wright some of you be old enough to remember he be the chairman of the House of Representatives and he resign in disgrace when this young Republican name Newt Gingrich find out about a shady book deal he have do he lose everything the most powerful Democrat in the country lose everything he lose he money he lose he power what do he have to say all this year later I be so much good off physically financially mentally and in almost every other way what other way would there be to be good off Vegetably Minerally Animally he be pretty much cover they there Moreese Bickham be somebody you have never hear of Moreese Bickham utter this word upon be release he be 78 year old he have spend 37 year in a Louisiana State Penitentiary for a crime he do not commit he be ultimately release for good behavior halfway through he sentence what do he say about he experience I do not have one minute regret it be a glorious experience glorious he be not say well there be some nice guy they have a gym glorious a word we usually reserve for something like a religious experience Harry S Langerman utter this word and he be somebody you might have know but do not because in 1949 he read a little article in the paper about a hamburger stand own by two brother name McDonalds and he think that be a really neat idea so he go to find they they say we can give you a franchise on this for 3 000 buck Harry go back to New York ask he brother a investment banker to loan he the 3 000 and he brother immortal word be you idiot nobody eat hamburger he would not lend he the money and of course six month later Ray Kroc have exactly the same idea it turn out person do eat hamburger and Ray Kroc for a while become the rich man in America and then finally some of you recognize this young photo of Pete Best who be the original drummer for the Beatles until they you know send he out on a errand and snuck away and pick up Ringo on a tour well in 1994 when Pete Best be interview yes he be still a drummer yes he be a studio musician he have this to say I be happy than I would have be with the Beatles okay there be something important to be learn from this person and it be the secret of happiness here it be finally to be reveal First accrue wealth power and prestige then lose it laughter second spend as much of you life in prison as you possibly can laughter third make somebody else really really rich and finally never ever join the Beatles laughter yeah right because when person synthesize happiness as this gentleman seem to have do we all smile at they but we kind of roll we eye and say yeah right you never really want the job oh yeah right you really do not have that much in common with she and you figure that out just about the time she throw the engagement ring in you face we smirk because we believe that synthetic happiness be not of the same quality as what we might call natural happiness what be this term natural happiness be what we get when we get what we want and synthetic happiness be what we make when we do not get what we want and in we society we have a strong belief that synthetic happiness be of a inferior kind why do we have that belief well it be very simple what kind of economic engine would keep churn if we believe that not get what we want could make we just as happy as get it with all apology to my friend Matthieu Ricard a shopping mall full of Zen monk be not go to be particularly profitable because they do not want stuff enough laughter I want to suggest to you that synthetic happiness be every bit as real and endure as the kind of happiness you stumble upon when you get exactly what you be aim for I be a scientist so I be go to do this not with rhetoric but by marinate you in a little bit of datum let I first show you a experimental paradigm that be use to demonstrate the synthesis of happiness among regular old folk and this be not mine it be a 50 year old paradigm call the free choice paradigm it be very simple you bring in say six object and you ask a subject to rank they from the most to the least like in this case because this experiment use they this be Monet print so everybody can rank this Monet print from the one they like the most to the one they like the least now we give you a choice we happen to have some extra print in the closet we be go to give you one as you prize to take home we happen to have number three and number four we tell the subject this be a bit of a difficult choice because neither one be prefer strongly to the other but naturally person tend to pick number three because they like it a little good than number four sometime later it could be 15 minute it could be 15 day the same stimulus be put before the subject and the subject be ask to be rank the stimulus tell we how much you like they now what happen Watch as happiness be synthesize this be the result that have be replicate over and over again you be watch happiness be synthesize would you like to see it again Happiness the one I get be really good than I think that other one I do not get suck that be the synthesis of happiness laughter now what be the right response to that yeah right now here be the experiment we do and I hope this be go to convince you that yeah right be not the right response we do this experiment with a group of patient who have anterograde amnesia this be hospitalize patient most of they have Korsakoff syndrome a polyneuritic psychosis they drink way too much and they can not make new memory ok they remember they childhood but if you walk in and introduce yourself and then leave the room when you come back they do not know who you be we take we Monet print to the hospital and we ask this patient to rank they from the one they like the most to the one they like the least we then give they the choice between number three and number four like everybody else they say Gee thanks Doc that be great I could use a new print I will take number three we explain we would have number three mail to they we gather up we material and we go out of the room and count to a half hour laughter back into the room we say hi we be back the patient bless they say ah doc I be sorry I have get a memory problem that be why I be here if I have meet you before I do not remember really you do not remember I be just here with the Monet print sorry Doc I just do not have a clue no problem Jim All I want you to do be rank this for I from the one you like the most to the one you like the least what do they do well let first check and make sure they be really amnesiac we ask this amnesiac patient to tell we which one they own which one they choose last time which one be theirs and what we find be amnesiac patient just guess this be normal control where if I do this with you all of you would know which print you choose but if I do this with amnesiac patient they do not have a clue they can not pick they print out of a lineup here be what normal control do they synthesize happiness right this be the change in like score the change from the first time they rank to the second time they rank normal control show that be the magic I show you now I be show it to you in graphical form the one I own be good than I think the one I do not own the one I leave behind be not as good as I think Amnesiacs do exactly the same thing think about this result this person like good the one they own but they do not know they own it yeah right be not the right response what this person do when they synthesize happiness be they really truly change they affective hedonic aesthetic reaction to that poster they be not just say it because they own it because they do not know they own it when psychologist show you bar you know that they be show you average of lot of person and yet all of we have this psychological immune system this capacity to synthesize happiness but some of we do this trick good than other and some situation allow anybody to do it more effectively than other situation do it turn out that freedom the ability to make up you mind and change you mind be the friend of natural happiness because it allow you to choose among all that delicious future and find the one that you would most enjoy but freedom to choose to change and make up you mind be the enemy of synthetic happiness and I be go to show you why Dilbert already know of course Dogbert tech support how may I abuse you my printer print a blank page after every document why complain about get free paper free be not you just give I my own paper look at the quality of the free paper compare to you lousy regular paper only a fool or a liar would say that they look the same now that you mention it it do seem a little silky what be you do I be help person accept the thing they can not change indeed the psychological immune system work well when we be totally stick when we be trap this be the difference between dating and marriage you go out on a date with a guy and he pick he nose you do not go out on another date you be married to a guy and he pick he nose he have a heart of gold do not touch the fruitcake you find a way to be happy with what be happen laughter now what I want to show you be that person do not know this about themselves and not know this can work to we supreme disadvantage here be a experiment we do at Harvard we create a black and white photography course and we allow student to come in and learn how to use a darkroom so we give they camera they go around campus they take 12 picture of they favorite professor and they dorm room and they dog and all the other thing they want to have Harvard memory of they bring we the camera we make up a contact sheet they figure out which be the two good picture and we now spend six hour teach they about darkroom and they blow two of they up and they have two gorgeous eight by 10 glossy of meaningful thing to they and we say which one would you like to give up I have to give one up yes we need one as evidence of the class project so you have to give I one you have to make a choice you get to keep one and I get to keep one now there be two condition in this experiment in one case the student be tell but you know if you want to change you mind I will always have the other one here and in the next four day before I actually mail it to headquarters yeah headquarters I will be glad to swap it out with you in fact I will come to you dorm room just give I a email well yet I will check with you you ever want to change you mind it be totally returnable the other half of the student be tell exactly the opposite make you choice and by the way the mail be go out gosh in two minute to England you picture will be wing its way over the Atlantic you will never see it again half of the student in each of this condition be ask to make prediction about how much they be go to come to like the picture that they keep and the picture they leave behind other student be just send back to they little dorm room and they be measure over the next three to six day on they liking satisfaction with the picture and look at what we find First of all here be what student think be go to happen they think they be go to maybe come to like the picture they choose a little more than the one they leave behind but this be not statistically significant difference it be a very small increase and it do not much matter whether they be in the reversible or irreversible condition wrong o bad simulator because here be what be really happen both right before the swap and five day later person who be stick with that picture who have no choice who can never change they mind like it a lot and person who be deliberate should I return it have I get the right one maybe this be not the good one maybe I leave the good one have kill themselves they do not like they picture and in fact even after the opportunity to swap have expire they still do not like they picture why because the reversible condition be not conducive to the synthesis of happiness so here be the final piece of this experiment we bring in a whole new group of naive Harvard student and we say you know we be do a photography course and we can do it one of two way we could do it so that when you take the two picture you would have four day to change you mind or we be do another course where you take the two picture and you make up you mind right away and you can never change it which course would you like to be in duh 66 percent of the student two third prefer to be in the course where they have the opportunity to change they mind hello 66 percent of the student choose to be in the course in which they will ultimately be deeply dissatisfied with the picture because they do not know the condition under which synthetic happiness grow the Bard say everything good of course and he be make my point here but he be make it hyperbolically t be nothing good or bad but thinking make it so it be nice poetry but that can not exactly be right be there really nothing good or bad be it really the case that gall bladder surgery and a trip to Paris be just the same thing laughter that seem like a one question iq test they can not be exactly the same in more turgid prose but close to the truth be the father of modern capitalism Adam Smith and he say this this be worth contemplate the great source of both the misery and disorder of human life seem to arise from overrate the difference between one permanent situation and another some of this situation may no doubt deserve to be prefer to other but none of they can deserve to be pursue with that passionate ardor which drive we to violate the rule either of prudence or of justice or to corrupt the future tranquility of we mind either by shame from the remembrance of we own folly or by remorse for the horror of we own injustice in other word yes some thing be good than other we should have preference that lead we into one future over another but when that preference drive we too hard and too fast because we have overrate the difference between this future we be at risk when we ambition be bound it lead we to work joyfully when we ambition be unbounded it lead we to lie to cheat to steal to hurt other to sacrifice thing of real value when we fear be bound we be prudent we be cautious we be thoughtful when we fear be unbounded and overblown we be reckless and we be cowardly the lesson I want to leave you with from this datum be that we longing and we worry be both to some degree overblown because we have within we the capacity to manufacture the very commodity we be constantly chase when we choose experience thank you applause
