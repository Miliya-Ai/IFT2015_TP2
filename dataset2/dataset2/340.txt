the north coast of California have rainfor temperate rainforest where it can rain more than 100 inch a year this be the realm of the Coast Redwood tree its species name be Sequoia semperviren Sequoia semperviren be the tall living organism on Earth the range of the species go up to as much as 380 foot tall that be 38 story tall this be tree that would stand out in midtown Manhattan nobody know how old the old live Coast Redwoods be because nobody have ever drill into any of they to count they annual growth ring and in any case the center of the old individual appear to be hollow but it be believe that the old living redwood be perhaps 2 500 year old roughly the age of the Parthenon although it be also suspect that there may be individual tree that be old than that you can see the range of the Coast Redwoods it be here in red the large individual of this species the dreadnought of they kind live just on the north coast of California where the rain be really intense in recent historic time about 96 percent of the Coast Redwood forest be cut down especially in a series of burst of intense liquidation log clear cutting that take place in the 1970 through the early 1990 even so about four percent of the primeval redwood rainforest remain intact wild and now protect entirely protect in a chain of small park string out like pearl along the north coast of California include Redwood National Park but curiously Redwood rainforest the fragment that we have leave to this day remain under explore redwood rainforest be incredibly difficult to move through and even today individual tree be be discover that have never be see before include in the summer of 2006 Hyperion the world tall tree I be go to do a little gedanken experiment I be go to ask you to imagine what a redwood really be as a live organism and Chris if I could have you up here I have a tape measure it be a kind loaner from TED and Chris if you could take the end of that tape measure we be go to show you what the diameter at breast height of a big redwood be unfortunately this tape be not long enough it be only a 25 foot tape Chris could you extend you arm out that way there we go ok and maybe about here about 30 foot be the diameter of a big redwood now let you imagination go upward into space think about this tree rise upward into redwood space 325 foot 32 story a individual live organism articulate its form upward into space over long period of time the redwood species seem to exist in another kind of time not human time but what we might call redwood time redwood time move at a more stately pace than human time to we when we look at a redwood tree it seem to be motionless and still and yet Redwoods be constantly in motion move upward into space articulate themselves and fill redwood space over redwood time over thousand of year plant this small seed wait 2 000 year and you get this the Lost Monarch it dwell in the Grove of Titans on the north coast and be discover in 1998 and yet when you look at the base of a redwood tree you be not see the organism you be like a mouse look at the foot of a elephant and most of the organism be overhead unseen I become very interested and I write about a couple Steve Sillett and Marie Antoine be the principal explorer of the redwood forest canopy they be world class athlete and they also be world class forest ecology scientist Steve Sillett when he be a 19 year old college student at Reed College have hear that the redwood forest canopy be consider to be a so call Redwood desert that be to say at that time it be believe that there be nothing up there except the branch of redwood tree and with a friend of he he take it upon himself to free climb a redwood without rope or any equipment to see what be up there he climb up a small tree next to this giant Redwood and then he leap through space and grab a branch with he hand and end up hang like catch a bar of a trapeze and then from there he climb directly up the bark until he get to the top of the tree he friend a guy name Marwood Harris be follow behind neither one of they have notice that there be a yellow jacket wasp nest the size of a bowling ball hang from the branch that Steve have jump into and when Marwood make the jump he be cover with wasp sting he in the face and eye he nearly let go he would have fall to he death be 75 foot above the ground but they make it to the top and what they find be not a redwood desert but a lost world a kind of three dimensional labyrinth in the air fill with unknown life now I have be work on other topic the emergence of infectious disease which come out of the natural ecosystem of the Earth make a trans species jump and get into human after three book on this it get to be a bit much in a way my wife and I adore we child and I begin climb tree with my kid as just something to do with they use the so call arborist climb technique with rope you use rope to get yourself up into the crown of a tree child be incredibly adept at climb tree that be my son Oliver they do not seem to suffer from the same fear of height that human do laughter if ontogeny recapitulate phylogeny then child be somewhat close to we root as primate in the arboreal forest human appear to be the only primate that I know of that be afraid of height all other primate when they be scare they run up a tree where they feel safe we camp overnight in the tree in tree boat this be my daughter Laura then 15 look out of a tree boat she be by the way tie in with a rope so she can not fall look out of a tree boat in the morning and hearing birdsong come in three dimension around we we have be visit in the night by fly squirrel who do not seem to recognize human for what they be because they have never see they in the canopy before and we practice advanced technique like sky walk where you can move from tree to tree through space rather like Spiderman it become a writing project when Steve Sillett get up into a big redwood he fire a arrow which trail a fishing line which get over a branch in the tree and then you ascend up a rope which have be drag into the tree by the line you ascend 30 story there be two person climb this tree Gaya which be think to be one of the old redwood there they be they be only one seventh of the way up that tree you do feel a sense of exposure there be a small person right down there on the ground you feel like you be climb a wall of wood but then you enter the redwood canopy and it be like come through a layer of cloud and all of a sudden you lose sight of the ground and you also lose sight of the sky and you be in a three dimensional labyrinth in the air fill with hang garden of fern grow out of soil which be populate with all kind of small organism there be epiphyte plant that grow on tree this be huckleberry bush many species of moss and then all sort of lichen just plaster the tree when you get near the top of the tree you feel like you can not fall in fact it be difficult to move you be worm you way through branch which be crowd with live thing that do not occur near the ground it be like scuba diving into a coral reef except you be go upward instead of downward and then the tree tend to flare out into platform like area at the top Maria sit on one of they this limb could be five to six hundred year old Redwoods grow very slowly in they top they also have a feature thicket of huckleberry bush that grow out of the top of redwood tree that be technically know as huckleberry afro and you can sit there and snack on the berry while you be rest redwood have a enormous surface area that extend upward into space because they have a propensity to do something call reiteration a redwood be a fractal and as they put out limb the limb burst into small tree copy of the Redwood now here we see a reiteration in Chronos one of the old redwood this reiteration be a huge flying buttress that come out the tree itself this buttress be less than halfway up the tree and then it burst into a forest of Redwoods this particular extra trunk be a meter across at the base and extend upward for 150 foot it be as big as any of the big tree east of the Mississippi River and yet it be only a minor feature on Chronos this three dimensional map of the crown structure of a redwood name Iluvatar make by Steve Sillett Marie Antoine and they colleague give you a idea what you be see here be a hierarchical schematic development of the trunk of this tree as it have elaborate itself over time into six layer of fractal of trunk spring from trunk spring from trunk I ask Steve to put a human being in this to give a sense of scale there be the person right there the person be wave to we I have want to ask Craig Venter if it would be possible to insert a synthetic chromosome into a human so that we could reiterate ourselves if we want to and if we be able to reiterate then the finger of we hand would be person who look like we and they would have person on they hand and so on and if we have redwood like biology we would have six layer of person on we hand as it be and it would be a lovely thing to be able to wave to someone and have all we reiteration wave at the same time laughter to reiterate the point let go close into Iluvatar we be look at that yellow box and this hallucinatory drawing show you everything you see in this drawing be Iluvatar this be millennial structure portion of the tree that be believe to be more than 1 000 year old there be four human in this shot one two three four and there be also something that I want to show you this be a fly buttress redwood grow back into themselves as they expand into space and this flying buttress be a limb shoot out of that small trunk go back into the main trunk and fuse with it Flying buttress just as in a cathedral help strengthen the crown of the tree and help the tree exist long through time the scientist be do all kind of experiment in this tree they have wire they like patient in a icu they be find out that Redwoods can move moisture out of the air and down into they trunk possibly all the way into they root system they also have the ability to put root anywhere in the tree itself if a portion of a redwood be rot the redwood will send root into its own form and draw nutrient out of itself as it fall apart if we have redwood like biology if we get a touch of gangrene in we arm then we could just you know extract the nutrient extract the nutrient and the moisture out of it until it fall off Canopy soil can occur up to a meter deep hundred of foot above the ground and there be organism in this soil that have as yet no name this be a unnamed species of copepod a copepod be a crustacean this copepod be a major constituent of the ocean and they be a major part of the diet of graze baleen whale what they be do in the redwood forest canopy soil hundred of foot above the ocean or how they get there be completely unknown there be some interesting theory that if I have time I would tell you about but as you go and you look close at a tree what you see be you see increase complexity we be look at the very top of Gaya which be think to be the old redwood Gaya may be 3 000 to 5 000 year old no one really know but its top have break off and it be be rot back now this little Japanese garden like creation probably take 700 year to form in its complexity that we see right now as you look at a tree it take a magnifying glass to see a giant tree I have to show you something unfortunately very sad at the conclusion of this talk the Eastern Hemlock tree have often be describe as the redwood of the East and we be move in a full circle now in the 1950 a small organism appear in Richmond Virginia call the hemlock woolly adelgid it make a trans species jump out of some other organism in Asia where it be live on hemlock tree in Asia when it move into its new host the Eastern Hemlock tree it escape its predator and the new tree have no resistance to it the Eastern Hemlock forest be be consider in some way the last fragment of primeval rainforest east of the Mississippi River I have not even know that there be rainforest in the east but in great smoky mountain National Park it can rain up to 100 inch of rain a year and in the last two to three summer this invasive organism this kind of Ebola of the tree as it be have sweep through the primeval hemlock forest of the east and have absolutely wipe it out I climb there this past summer this be great smoky mountain National Park and the Hemlocks be dead as far as the eye can see and what we be see be not just the potential death of the Eastern Hemlock species that be to say its extinction from nature due to this invade parasite but we be also see the death of a incredibly complex ecosystem for which this tree be merely the substrate for the aerial labyrinth of the sky that exist in they crown it be absolutely heartbreaking to see one of the thing that be just I almost can not conceive it be the idea that the national news media have not pick this up at all and this be the devastation of one of the most important ecosystem in North America what can the Redwoods tell we about ourselves well I think they can tell we something about human time the flicker transitory quality of human time and the brevity of human life the necessity to love but we be different from tree and they can also teach we something about ourselves in the difference that we have we be human and we have the capacity to love we have the capacity to wonder and we have a sort of boundless curiosity a restless inquisitiveness that so suit we as primate I think and at least for I personally the tree have teach I a entirely new way of love my child explore with they the forest canopy have be one of the most lovely thing of my existence on Earth and I think that one of the happy thing be the sense that with my child I have be able to introduce they into the very small circle of human who be lucky enough or possibly stupid enough to still climb tree thank you very much applause Chris Anderson I think at a previous TED I think it be Nathan Myhrvold who tell I that it be think that because this tree be like 2 000 year and old on many of they there be ecosystem where there be species that be not find anywhere on the Earth except on that one tree be that correct Richard Preston yes that be correct I mention Hyperion the world tall tree and I be a member of a climbing team that make the first climb of it in 2006 and while we be climb Hyperion Marie Antoine spot a unknown species of golden brown ant about halfway up the trunk ant be not know to occur in redwood tree curiously enough and we wonder whether this ant this species of ant be only endemic to that one tree or possibly to that grove and in subsequent climb they could never find that ant again and so no specimen have ever be collect we do not know what it be we just know it be there CA so you have to wonder when you know if some other species than we be record the story that matter on Earth you know we story be about Iraq and war and politics and celebrity gossip you have just tell we a different story of this tragic arm race that be happen and maybe whole ecosystem go forever it be a amazing sense of wonder you have give I and a sense of just how fragile this whole thing be rp it be fragile and you know I think about emerge human disease parasite that move into the human species but that be just a very small facet of a much great problem of invasion of species worldwide all through the ecosystem and you know the Earth itself can partly cause by we inadvertently rp cause by human cause by the movement of human you can think of the Earth biosphere as a palace and the continent be room in the palace and the island be small room but lately the door of the palace have be fling open and the wall be come down CA Richard Preston thank you very much I think rp thank you
