the great irony in global health be that the poor country carry the large disease burden if we resize the country of the globe in proportion to the subject of interest we see that sub Saharan Africa be the bad hit region by HIV AIDS this be the most devastating epidemic of we time we also see that this region have the least capability in term of deal with the disease there be very few doctor and quite frankly this country do not have the resource that be need to cope with such epidemic so what the western country develop country have generously do be they have propose to provide free drug to all person in Third World country who actually can not afford this medication and this have already save million of life and it have prevent entire economy from capsize in sub Saharan Africa but there be a fundamental problem that be kill the effort in fight this disease because if you keep throw drug out at person who do not have diagnostic service you end up create a problem of drug resistance this be already begin to happen in sub Saharan Africa the problem be that what begin as a tragedy in the Third World could easily become a global problem and the last thing we want to see be drug resistant strain of HIV pop up all over the world because it will make treatment more expensive and it could also restore the pre ARV carnage of HIV AIDS I experience this firsthand as a high school student in Uganda this be in the 90 during the peak of the HIV epidemic before there be any arv in sub Saharan Africa and during that time I actually lose more relative as well as the teacher who teach I to HIV AIDS so this become one of the drive passion of my life to help find real solution that could address this kind of problem we all know about the miracle of miniaturization back in the day computer use to fill this entire room and person actually use to work inside the computer but what electronic miniaturization have do be that it have allow person to shrink technology into a cell phone and I be sure everyone here enjoy cell phone that can actually be use in the remote area of the world in the Third World country the good news be that the same technology that allow miniaturization of electronics be now allow we to miniaturize biological laboratory so right now we can actually miniaturize biological and chemistry laboratory onto microfluidic chip I be very lucky to come to the US right after high school and be able to work on this technology and develop some device this be a microfluidic chip that I develop a close look at how the technology work this be channel that be about the size of a human hair so you have integrate valve pump mixer and injector so you can fit entire diagnostic experiment onto a microfluidic system so what I plan to do with this technology be to actually take the current state of the technology and build a HIV kit in a microfluidic system so with one microfluidic chip which be the size of a iPhone you can actually diagnose 100 patient at the same time for each patient we will be able to do up to 100 different viral load per patient and this be only do in four hour 50 time fast than the current state of the art at a cost that will be five to 500 time cheap than the current option so this will allow we to create personalize medicine in the Third World at a cost that be actually achievable and make the world a safe place I invite you interest as well as you involvement in drive this vision to a point of practical reality thank you very much applause
