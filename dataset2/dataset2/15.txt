Music Music end applause applause end hi everyone I be Sirena I be 11 year old and from Connecticut audience cheer applause well I be not really sure why I be here laughter I mean what do this have to do with technology entertainment and design well I count my ipod cellphone and computer as technology but this have nothing to do with that so I do a little research on it well this be what I find of course I hope I can memorize it clear throat the violin be make of a wood box and four metal string by pull a string it vibrate and produce a sound wave which pass through a piece of wood call a bridge and go down to the wood box and get amplify but let I think laughter place you finger at different place on the fingerboard change the string length and that change the frequency of the sound wave sigh oh my gosh laughter ok this be sort of technology but I can call it a 16th century technology but actually the most fascinating thing that I find be that even the audio system or wave transmission nowadays be still base on the same principle of produce and project sound be not that cool laughter applause design I love its design I remember when I be little my mom ask I would you like to play the violin or the piano I look at that giant monster and say to myself I be not go to lock myself on that bench the whole day laughter this be small and lightweight I can play from stand sit or walk and you know what the good of all be that if I do not want to practice whisper I can hide it laughter the violin be very beautiful some person relate it as the shape of a lady but whether you like it or not it be be so for more than 400 year unlike modern stuff that easily look dated but I think it be very personal and unique that although each violin look pretty similar no two violin sound the same even from the same maker or base on the same model entertainment I love the entertainment but actually the instrument itself be not very entertaining I mean when I first get my violin and try to play around on it it be actually really bad because it do not sound the way I have hear from other kid it be so horrible and so scratchy so it be not entertaining at all but besides my brother find this very funny yuk yuk yuk laughter a few year later I hear a joke about the great violinist Jascha Heifetz after Mr Heifetz concert a lady come over and compliment he oh Mr Heifetz you violin sound so great tonight and Mr Heifetz be a very cool person so he pick up he violin and say funny I do not hear anything laughter now I realize that as the musician we human being with we great mind artistic heart and skill can change this 16th century technology and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment now I know why I be here Music Music end applause at first I think I be just go to be here to perform but unexpectedly I learn and enjoy much more but although some of the talk be quite up there for I laughter like the multi dimension stuff I mean honestly I would be happy enough if I could actually get my two dimension correct in school laughter but actually the most impressive thing to I be that well actually I would also like to say this for all child be to say thank you to all adult for actually care for we a lot and to make we future world much good thank you applause music music end applause applause end Music Music end applause
