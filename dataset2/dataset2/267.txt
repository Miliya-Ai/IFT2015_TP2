as a particle physicist I study the elementary particle and how they interact on the most fundamental level for most of my research career I have be use accelerator such as the electron accelerator at Stanford University just up the road to study thing on the small scale but more recently I have be turn my attention to the universe on the large scale because as I will explain to you the question on the small and the large scale be actually very connected so I be go to tell you about we twenty first century view of the universe what it be make of and what the big question in the physical science be at least some of the big question so recently we have realize that the ordinary matter in the universe and by ordinary matter I mean you I the planet the star the galaxy the ordinary matter make up only a few percent of the content of the universe almost a quarter or approximately a quarter of the matter in the universe be stuff that be invisible by invisible I mean it do not absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum it do not emit in the electromagnetic spectrum it do not reflect it do not interact with the electromagnetic spectrum which be what we use to detect thing it do not interact at all so how do we know it be there we know it be there by its gravitational effect in fact this dark matter dominate the gravitational effect in the universe on a large scale and I will be tell you about the evidence for that what about the rest of the pie the rest of the pie be a very mysterious substance call dark energy more about that later ok so for now let turn to the evidence for dark matter in this galaxy especially in a spiral galaxy like this most of the mass of the star be concentrate in the middle of the galaxy this huge mass of all this star keep star in circular orbit in the galaxy so we have this star go around in circle like this as you can imagine even if you know physics this should be intuitive ok that star that be close to the mass in the middle will be rotate at a high speed than that that be further out here ok so what you would expect be that if you measure the orbital speed of the star that they should be slow on the edge than on the inside in other word if we measure speed as a function of distance this be the only time I be go to show a graph ok we would expect that it go down as the distance increase from the center of the galaxy when that measurement be make instead what we find be that the speed be basically constant as a function of distance if it be constant that mean that the star out here be feel the gravitational effect of matter that we do not see in fact this galaxy and every other galaxy appear to be embed in a cloud of this invisible dark matter and this cloud of matter be much more spherical than the galaxy themselves and it extend over a much wide range than the galaxy so we see the galaxy and fixate on that but it be actually a cloud of dark matter that be dominate the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy galaxy themselves be not strew randomly in space they tend to cluster and this be a example of a very actually famous cluster the coma cluster and there be thousand of galaxy in this cluster they be the white fuzzy elliptical thing here so this galaxy cluster we take a snapshot now we take a snapshot in a decade it will look identical but this galaxy be actually move at extremely high speed they be move around in this gravitational potential well of this cluster ok so all of this galaxy be move we can measure the speed of this galaxy they orbital velocity and figure out how much mass be in this cluster and again what we find be that there be much more mass there than can be account for by the galaxy that we see or if we look in other part of the electromagnetic spectrum we see that there be a lot of gas in this cluster as well but that can not account for the mass either in fact there appear to be about ten time as much mass here in the form of this invisible or dark matter as there be in the ordinary matter ok it would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly I be just put this big blue blob on there ok to try to remind you that it be there can we see it more visually yes we can and so let I lead you through how we can do this so here be a observer it could be a eye it could be a telescope and suppose there be a galaxy out here in the universe how do we see that galaxy a ray of light leave the galaxy and travel through the universe for perhaps billion of year before it enter the telescope or you eye now how do we deduce where the galaxy be well we deduce it by the direction that the ray be travel as it enter we eye right we say the ray of light come this way the galaxy must be there ok now suppose I put in the middle a cluster of galaxy and do not forget the dark matter ok now if we consider a different ray of light one go off like this we now need to take into account what Einstein predict when he develop general relativity and that be that the gravitational field due to mass will deflect not only the trajectory of particle but will deflect light itself so this light ray will not continue in a straight line but would rather bend and could end up go into we eye where will this observer see the galaxy you can respond up right we extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy be up here be there any other ray of light that could make into the observer eye from that galaxy yes great I see person go down like this so a ray of light could go down be bend up into the observer eye and the observer see a ray of light here now take into account the fact that we live in a three dimensional universe ok a three dimensional space be there any other ray of light that could make it into the eye yes the ray would lie on a I would like to see yeah on a cone so there be a whole ray of light ray of light on a cone that will all be bend by that cluster and make it into the observer eye if there be a cone of light come into my eye what do I see a circle a ring it be call a Einstein ring Einstein predict that ok now it will only be a perfect ring if the source the deflector and the eyeball in this case be all in a perfectly straight line if they be slightly skew we will see a different image now you can do a experiment tonight over the reception ok to figure out what that image will look like because it turn out that there be a kind of lens that we can devise that have the right shape to produce this kind of effect we call this gravitational lensing and so this be you instrument ok laughter but ignore the top part it be the base that I want you to concentrate ok so actually at home whenever we break a wineglass I save the bottom take it over to the machine shop we shave it off and I have a little gravitational lens ok so it be get the right shape to produce the lensing and so the next thing you need to do in you experiment be grab a napkin I grab a piece of graph paper I be a physicist laughter so a napkin draw a little model galaxy in the middle and now put the lens over the galaxy and what you will find be that you will see a ring a Einstein ring now move the base off to the side and the ring will split up into arc ok and you can put it on top of any image on the graph paper you can see how all the line on the graph paper have be distort and again this be a kind of a accurate model of what happen with the gravitational lensing ok so the question be do we see this in the sky do we see arc in the sky when we look at say a cluster of galaxy and the answer be yes and so here be a image from the Hubble Space Telescope many of the image you be see be early from the Hubble Space Telescope Well first of all for the golden shape galaxy that be the galaxy in the cluster they be the one that be embed in that sea of dark matter that be cause the bend of the light to cause this optical illusion or mirage practically of the background galaxy so the streak that you see all this streak be actually distort image of galaxy that be much further away so what we can do then be base on how much distortion we see in that image we can calculate how much mass there must be in this cluster and it be a enormous amount of mass and also you can tell by eye by look at this that this arc be not center on individual galaxy they be center on some more spread out structure and that be the dark matter in which the cluster be embed ok so this be the close you can get to kind of see at least the effect of the dark matter with you naked eye ok so a quick review then to see that you be follow so the evidence that we have that a quarter of the universe be dark matter this gravitationally attract stuff be that galaxy the speed with which star orbit galaxy be much too large it must be embed in dark matter the speed with which galaxy within cluster be orbit be much too large it must be embed in dark matter and we see this gravitational lensing effect this distortion that say that again cluster be embed in dark matter ok so now let turn to dark energy so to understand the evidence for dark energy we need to discuss something that Stephen Hawking refer to in the previous session and that be the fact that space itself be expand so if we imagine a section of we infinite universe and so I have put down four spiral galaxy ok and imagine that you put down a set of tape measure so every line on here correspond to a tape measure horizontal or vertical for measure where thing be if you could do this what you would find that with each pass day each passing year each pass billion of year ok the distance between galaxy be get great and it be not because galaxy be move away from each other through space they be not necessarily move through space they be move away from each other because space itself be get big ok that be what the expansion of the universe or space mean so they be move far apart now what Stephen Hawking mention as well be that after the Big Bang space expand at a very rapid rate but because gravitationally attract matter be embed in this space it tend to slow down the expansion of the space ok so the expansion slow down with time so in the last century ok person debate about whether this expansion of space would continue forever whether it would slow down you know will be slow down but continue forever slow down and stop asymptotically stop or slow down stop and then reverse so it start to contract again so a little over a decade ago two group of physicist and astronomer set out to measure the rate at which the expansion of space be slow down ok by how much less be it expand today compare to say a couple of billion year ago the startling answer to this question ok from this experiment be that space be expand at a fast rate today than it be a few billion year ago ok so the expansion of space be actually speed up this be a completely surprising result there be no persuasive theoretical argument for why this should happen ok no one be predict ahead of time this be what be go to be find it be the opposite of what be expect so we need something to be able to explain that now it turn out in the mathematics you can put it in as a term that be a energy but it be a completely different type of energy from anything we have ever see before we call it dark energy and it have this effect of cause space to expand but we do not have a good motivation for put it in there at this point ok so it be really unexplained as to why we need to put it in now so at this point then what I want to really emphasize to you be that first of all dark matter and dark energy be completely different thing ok there be really two mystery out there as to what make up most of the universe and they have very different effect dark matter because it gravitationally attract it tend to encourage the growth of structure ok so cluster of galaxy will tend to form because of all this gravitational attraction Dark energy on the other hand be put more and more space between the galaxy make it the gravitational attraction between they decrease and so it impede the growth of structure so by look at thing like cluster of galaxy and how they they number density how many there be as a function of time we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy compete against each other in structure form in term of dark matter I say that we do not have any you know really persuasive argument for dark energy do we have anything for dark matter and the answer be yes we have well motivated candidate for the dark matter now what do I mean by well motivated I mean that we have mathematically consistent theory that be actually introduce to explain a completely different phenomenon ok thing that I have not even talk about that each predict the existence of a very weakly interact new particle so this be exactly what you want in physics where a prediction come out of a mathematically consistent theory that be actually develop for something else but we do not know if either of that be actually the dark matter candidate ok one or both who know or it could be something completely different now we look for this dark matter particle because after all they be here in the room ok and they do not come in the door they just pass through anything they can come through the building through the Earth they be so non interact so one way to look for they be to build detector that be extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle come through and bump it so a crystal that will ring if that happen so one of my colleague up the road and he collaborator have build such a detector and they have put it deep down in a iron mine in Minnesota ok deep under the ground and in fact in the last couple of day announce the most sensitive result so far they have not see anything ok but it put limit on what the mass and the interaction strength of this dark matter particle be there be go to be a satellite telescope launch later this year and it will look towards the middle of the galaxy to see if we can see dark matter particle annihilate and produce gamma ray that could be detect with this the large Hadron Collider a particle physics accelerator that we will be turn on later this year it be possible that dark matter particle might be produce at the large Hadron Collider now because they be so non interactive they will actually escape the detector so they signature will be miss energy ok now unfortunately there be a lot of new physics whose signature could be miss energy so it will be hard to tell the difference and finally for future endeavor there be telescope be design specifically to address the question of dark matter and dark energy ground base telescope and there be three space base telescope that be in competition right now to be launch to investigate dark matter and dark energy so in term of the big question what be dark matter what be dark energy the big question face physics and I be sure you have lot of question which I very much look forward to address over the next 72 hour while I be here thank you applause
