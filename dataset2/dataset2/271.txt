dog have interest they have interest sniff each other chase squirrel and if we do not make that a reward in training that will be a distraction it be always sort of strike I as really a scary thought that if you see a dog in a park and the owner be call it and the owner say you know Puppy come here come here and the dog think hmm interesting I be sniff this other dog rear end the owner call it be a difficult choice right rear end owner rear end win I mean you lose you can not compete with the environment if you have a adolescent dog brain so when we train we be always try to take into account the dog point of view now I be here largely because there be kind of a rift in dog training at the moment that on one side we have person who think that you train a dog number one by make up rule human rule we do not take the dog point of view into account so the human say you be go to act this way damn it we be go to force you to act against you will to bend to we will then number two we keep this rule a secret from the dog and then number three now we can punish the dog for break rule he do not even know exist so you get a little puppy he come he only crime be he grow when he be a little puppy he put he paw on you leg you know be not that nice and you go oh there be a good boy you bend down you pat he you reward he for jump up he one mistake be he be a Tibetan mastiff and a few month late he weigh you know 80 pound every time he jump up he get all sort of abuse I mean it be really very very scary the abuse that dog get so this whole dominance issue number one what we get in dog training be this Mickey Mouse interpretation of a very complicated social system and they take this stuff seriously male dog be very serious about a hierarchy because it prevent physical fight of course female dog bitch on the other hand have several bitch amendment to male hierarchical rule the number one be I have it you do not and what you will find be a very very low rank bitch will quite easily keep a bone away from a high ranking male so we get in dog training this notion of dominance or of the alpha dog I be sure that you have hear this dog get so abused dog horse and human this be the three species which be so abuse in life and the reason be build into they behavior be to always come back and apologize like oh I be sorry you have to beat I I be really sorry yes it be my fault they be just so beatable and that be why they get beat the poor puppy jump up you open the dog book what do it say hold he front paw squeeze he front paw stamp on he hind foot squirt he in the face with lemon juice hit he on the head with a roll up newspaper knee he in the chest flip he over backwards because he grow and because he be perform a behavior you have train he to do this be insanity I ask owner well how would you like the dog to greet you and person say well I do not know to sit I guess I say let teach he to sit and then we give he a reason for sit because the first stage be basically teach a dog ESL I could speak to you and say Laytay chai paisey paisey go on something should happen now why be not you respond oh you do not speak Swahili well I have get news for you the dog do not speak English or American or Spanish or French so the first stage in training be to teach the dog ESL English as a second language and that be how we use the food lure in the hand and we use food because we be deal with owner my wife do not need food she be a great trainer much good than I be I do not need food but the average owner say Puppy sit or they go sit sit sit they be make a hand signal in front of the dog rectum for some reason like the dog have a third eye there it be insane you know sit sit no we go Puppy sit boom it be get it in six to 10 trial then we phase out the food as a lure and now the dog know that sit means sit and you can actually communicate to a dog in a perfectly construct English sentence Phoenix come here take this and go to Jamie please and I have teach she Phoenix come here take this go to and the name of my son Jamie and the dog can take a note and I have get my own little search and rescue dog he will find Jamie wherever he be you know wherever kid be crush rock by a stream or something and take he a little message that say hey dinner ready come in for dinner so at this point the dog know what we want it to do will it do it not necessarily no as I say if he be in the park and there be a rear end to sniff why come to the owner the dog live with you the dog can get you any time the dog can sniff you butt if you like when he want to at the moment he be in the park and you be compete with smell and other dog and squirrel so the second stage in training be to teach the dog to want to do what we want he to do and this be very easy we use the Premack principle basically we follow a low frequency behavior one the dog do not want to do by a high frequency behavior commonly know as a behavior problem or a dog hobby something the dog do like to do that will then become a reward for the low frequency behavior so we go sit on the couch sit tummy rub sit look I throw a tennis ball sit say hello to that other dog yes we put sniff butt on queue sit sniff butt so now all of this distraction that work against training now become reward that work for training and what we be do in essence be we be teach the dog kind of like we be let the dog think that the dog be train we and I can imagine this dog you know speak through the fence to say a Akita say wow my owner they be so incredibly easy to train they be like Golden Retrievers all I have to do be sit and they do everything they open door they drive my car they massage I they will throw tennis ball they will cook for I and serve the food it be like if I just sit that be my command then I have my own personal doorman chauffeur masseuse chef and waiter and now the dog really happy and this to I be always what training be so we really motivate the dog to want to do it such that the need for punishment seldom come up now we move to phase three when now there be time you know when daddy know well and I have a little sign on my fridge and it say because I be the daddy that be why sorry no more explanation I be the daddy you be not sit and there be time for example if my son friend leave the door open the dog have to know you do not step across this line this be a life or death thing you leave this the sanctity of you house and you could be hit on the street so some thing we have to let the dog know you must not do this and so we have to enforce but without force person here get very confused about what a punishment be they think a punishment be something nasty I bet a lot of you do right you think it be something painful or scary or nasty it do not have to be there be several definition of what a punishment be but one definition the most popular be a punishment be a stimulus that reduce the immediately precede behavior such that it be less likely to occur in the future it do not have to be nasty scary or painful and I would say if it do not have to be then maybe it should not be I be work with a very dangerous dog about a year ago and this be a dog that put both he owner in hospital plus the brother in law plus the child and I only agree to work with it if they promise it would stay in they house and they never take it outside the dog be actually euthanize now but this be a dog I work with for a while a lot of the aggression happen around the kitchen so while I be there this be on the fourth visit we do a four and a half hour down stay with the dog on he mat and he be keep there by the owner calm insistence when the dog would try to leave the mat she would say Rover on the mat on the mat on the mat the dog break he down stay 22 time in four and a half hour while she cook dinner because we have a lot of aggression relate towards food the break get few and few you see the punishment be work the behavior problem be go away she never raise she voice if she do she would have get bite it be not a good dog you shout at and a lot of my friend train really neat animal grizzly bear if you have ever see a grizzly bear on the telly or in film then it be a friend of mine who be train it killer whale I love it because it wire you up how be you go to reprimand a grizzly bear bad bear bad bear voom you head now be 100 yard away sail through the air ok this be crazy so where do we go from here we want a good way dog deserve good but for I the reason for this actually have to do with dog it have to do with watch person train puppy and realize they have horrendous interaction skill horrendous relationship skill not just with they puppy but with the rest of the family at class i mean my all time classic be another come here one you see someone in the park and I will cover my mic when I say this because I do not want to wake you up and there be the owner in the park and they dog over here and they say Rover come here Rover come here Rover come here you son of a bitch the dog say I do not think so laughter I mean who in they right mind would think that a dog would want to approach they when they be scream like that instead the dog say I know that tone I know that tone previously when I have approach I have get punish there I be walk onto a plane this for I be a pivotal moment in my career and it really cement what I want to do with this whole puppy training thing the notion of how to teach puppy in a dog friendly way to want to do what we want to do so we do not have to force they you know I puppy train my child and the seminal moment be I be get on a plane in Dallas and in row two be a father I presume and a young boy about five kick the back of the chair Johnny do not do that kick kick kick Johnny do not do that kick kick kick I be stand right here with my bag the father lean over grab he like this and give he ugly face and ugly face be this when you go face to face with a puppy or a child you say what be you do now stop it stop it stop it and I go oh my God do I do something that child have lose everything that one of the two person he can trust in this world have absolutely pull the rug from under he foot and I think do I tell this jerk to quit it I think Ian stay out of it stay out of it you know walk on I walk to the back of the plane I sit down and a thought come to I if that have be a dog I would have lay he out laughter if he have kick a dog I would have punch he out he kick a child grab the child like this and I let it go and this be what it be all about this relationship skill be so easy I mean we as human we shallowness when we choose a life mate base on the three c coat color conformation cuteness you know kind of like a little robot this be how we go into a relationship and it be hunky dory for a year and then a little behavior problem come up no different from the dog bark the husband will not clear up he clothes or the wife always late for meeting whatever it be ok and it then start and we get into this thing and we personal feedback there be two thing about it when you watch person interact with animal or other person there be very little feedback it be too infrequent and when it happen it be bad it be nasty you see it be especially in family especially with spouse especially with child especially with parent you see it especially in the workplace especially from boss to employee it be as if there be some schadenfreude there that we actually take delight in person get thing wrong so that we can then moan and groan and bitch at they and this I would say be the big human foible that we have it really be we take the good for grant and we moan and groan at the bad and I think this whole notion of this skill should be teach you know calculus be wonderful when I be a kid I be a calculus whiz I do not understand a thing about it now but I could do it as a kid geometry fantastic you know quantum mechanic this be cool thing but they do not save marriage and they do not raise child and my look to the future be and what I want to do with this doggy stuff be to teach person that you know you husband just as easy to train probably easy if you get a Rottie much easy to train you kid be easy to train all you have get to do be to watch they to time sample the behavior and say every five minute you ask the question be it good or be it bad if it be good say that be really neat thank you that be such a powerful training technique this should be teach in school Relationships how do you negotiate how you do negotiate with you friend who want you toy you know how to prepare you for you first relationship how on earth about raise child we think how we do it one night in bed we be pregnant and then we be raise the most important thing in life a child no this be what should be teach the good live the good habit which be just as hard to break as bad habit so that would be my wish to the future Ah damn I want to end exactly on time but I get eight seven six five four three two so thank you very much that be my talk thank you applause
