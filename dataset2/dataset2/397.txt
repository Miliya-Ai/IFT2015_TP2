Time fly it be actually almost 20 year ago when I want to reframe the way we use information the way we work together I invent the world wide web now 20 year on at TED I want to ask you help in a new reframe so go back to 1989 I write a memo suggest the global hypertext system nobody really do anything with it pretty much but 18 month later this be how innovation happen 18 month later my boss say I could do it on the side as a sort of a play project kick the tire of a new computer we have get and so he give I the time to code it up so I basically rough out what HTML should look like hypertext protocol http the idea of url this name for thing which start with http I write the code and put it out there why do I do it well it be basically frustration I be frustrated I be work as a software engineer in this huge very exciting lab lot of person come from all over the world they bring all sort of different computer with they they have all sort of different datum format all sort all kind of documentation system so that in all that diversity if I want to figure out how to build something out of a bit of this and a bit of this everything I look into I have to connect to some new machine I have to learn to run some new program I would find the information I want in some new datum format and this be all incompatible it be just very frustrating the frustration be all this unlock potential in fact on all this disc there be document so if you just imagine they all be part of some big virtual documentation system in the sky say on the internet then life would be so much easy well once you have have a idea like that it kind of get under you skin and even if person do not read you memo actually he do it be find after he die he copy he have write vague but exciting in pencil in the corner laughter but in general it be difficult it be really difficult to explain what the web be like it be difficult to explain to person now that it be difficult then but then ok when TED start there be no web so thing like click do not have the same meaning I can show somebody a piece of hypertext a page which have get link and we click on the link and bing there will be another hypertext page not impressive you know we have see that we have get thing on hypertext on cd rom what be difficult be to get they to imagine so imagine that that link could have go to virtually any document you could imagine alright that be the leap that be very difficult for person to make well some person do so yeah it be difficult to explain but there be a grassroots movement and that be what have make it most fun that have be the most exciting thing not the technology not the thing person have do with it but actually the community the spirit of all this person get together send the email that be what it be like then do you know what it be funny but right now it be kind of like that again I ask everybody more or less to put they document I say could you put you document on this web thing and you do thanks it be be a blast have not it I mean it have be quite interesting because we have find out that the thing that happen with the web really sort of blow we away they be much more than we have originally imagine when we put together the little initial website that we start off with now I want you to put you datum on the web turn out that there be still huge unlock potential there be still a huge frustration that person have because we have not get datum on the web as datum what do you mean datum what be the difference document datum well document you read ok more or less you read they you can follow link from they and that be it datum you can do all kind of stuff with a computer who be here or have otherwise see Hans Rosling talk one of the great yes a lot of person have see it one of the great TED Talks Hans put up this presentation in which he show for various different country in various different color he show income level on one axis and he show infant mortality and he shoot this thing animate through time so he have take this datum and make a presentation which just shatter a lot of myth that person have about the economics in the develop world he put up a slide a little bit like this it have underground all the datum ok datum be brown and boxy and boring and that be how we think of it be not it because datum you can not naturally use by itself but in fact datum drive a huge amount of what happen in we life and it happen because somebody take that datum and do something with it in this case Hans have put the datum together he have find from all kind of United Nations website and thing he have put it together combine it into something more interesting than the original piece and then he would put it into this software which I think he son develop originally and produce this wonderful presentation and Hans make a point of say look it be really important to have a lot of datum and I be happy to see that at the party last night that he be still say very forcibly it be really important to have a lot of datum so I want we now to think about not just two piece of datum be connect or six like he do but I want to think about a world where everybody have put datum on the web and so virtually everything you can imagine be on the web and then call that link datum the technology be link datum and it be extremely simple if you want to put something on the web there be three rule first thing be that that http name that thing that start with http we be use they not just for document now we be use they for thing that the document be about we be use they for person we be use they for place we be use they for you product we be use they for event all kind of conceptual thing they have name now that start with http second rule if I take one of this http name and I look it up and I do the web thing with it and I fetch the datum use the http protocol from the web I will get back some datum in a standard format which be kind of useful datum that somebody might like to know about that thing about that event who be at the event whatever it be about that person where they be bear thing like that so the second rule be I get important information back third rule be that when I get back that information it be not just get somebody height and weight and when they be bear it be get relationship datum be relationship interestingly datum be relationship this person be bear in Berlin Berlin be in Germany and when it have relationship whenever it express a relationship then the other thing that it be relate to be give one of that name that start http so I can go ahead and look that thing up so I look up a person I can look up then the city where they be bear then I can look up the region it be in and the town it be in and the population of it and so on so I can browse this stuff so that be it really that be link datum I write a article entitle Linked Data a couple of year ago and soon after that thing start to happen the idea of link datum be that we get lot and lot and lot of this box that Hans have and we get lot and lot and lot of thing sprout it be not just a whole lot of other plant it be not just a root supply a plant but for each of that plant whatever it be a presentation a analysis somebody look for pattern in the datum they get to look at all the datum and they get it connect together and the really important thing about datum be the more thing you have to connect together the more powerful it be so link datum the meme go out there and pretty soon Chris Bizer at the Freie Universitat in Berlin who be one of the first person to put interesting thing up he notice that Wikipedia you know Wikipedia the online encyclopedia with lot and lot of interesting document in it well in that document there be little square little box and in most information box there be datum so he write a program to take the datum extract it from Wikipedia and put it into a blob of link datum on the web which he call dbpedia Dbpedia be represent by the blue blob in the middle of this slide and if you actually go and look up Berlin you will find that there be other blob of datum which also have stuff about Berlin and they be link together so if you pull the datum from dbpedia about Berlin you will end up pull up this other thing as well and the exciting thing be it be start to grow this be just the grassroots stuff again ok let think about datum for a bit datum come in fact in lot and lot of different form think of the diversity of the web it be a really important thing that the web allow you to put all kind of datum up there so it be with datum I could talk about all kind of datum we could talk about government datum enterprise datum be really important there be scientific datum there be personal datum there be weather datum there be datum about event there be datum about talk and there be news and there be all kind of stuff I be just go to mention a few of they so that you get the idea of the diversity of it so that you also see how much unlock potential let start with government datum Barack Obama say in a speech that he American government datum would be available on the internet in accessible format and I hope that they will put it up as link datum that be important why be it important not just for transparency yeah transparency in government be important but that datum this be the datum from all the government department think about how much of that data be about how life be live in America it be actual useful it be get value I can use it in my company I could use it as a kid to do my homework so we be talk about make the place make the world run good by make this data available in fact if you be responsible if you know about some datum in a government department often you find that this person they be very tempt to keep it Hans call it database hug you hug you database you do not want to let it go until you have make a beautiful website for it well I would like to suggest that rather yes make a beautiful website who be I to say do not make a beautiful website make a beautiful website but first give we the unadulterated datum we want the datum we want unadulterated datum ok we have to ask for raw datum now and I be go to ask you to practice that ok can you say raw audience raw Tim Berners Lee can you say datum Audience Data TBL can you say now audience now tbl alright raw datum now Audience Raw datum now practice that it be important because you have no idea the number of excuse person come up with to hang onto they datum and not give it to you even though you have pay for it as a taxpayer and it be not just America it be all over the world and it be not just government of course it be enterprise as well so I be just go to mention a few other thought on datum here we be at TED and all the time we be very conscious of the huge challenge that human society have right now cure cancer understand the brain for Alzheimer understand the economy to make it a little bit more stable understanding how the world work the person who be go to solve that the scientist they have half form idea in they head they try to communicate that over the web but a lot of the state of knowledge of the human race at the moment be on database often sit in they computer and actually currently not share in fact I will just go into one area if you be look at Alzheimer for example drug discovery there be a whole lot of link datum which be just come out because scientist in that field realize this be a great way of get out of that silo because they have they genomic datum in one database in one building and they have they protein datum in another now they be stick it onto link datum and now they can ask the sort of question that you probably would not ask I would not ask they would what proteins be involve in signal transduction and also relate to pyramidal neuron well you take that mouthful and you put it into Google of course there be no page on the web which have answer that question because nobody have ask that question before you get 223 000 hit no result you can use you ask the link datum which they have now put together 32 hit each of which be a protein which have that property and you can look at the power of be able to ask that question as a scientist question which actually bridge across different discipline be really a complete sea change it be very very important scientist be totally stymie at the moment the power of the datum that other scientist have collect be lock up and we need to get it unlock so we can tackle that huge problem now if I go on like this you will think that all the datum come from huge institution and have nothing to do with you but that be not true in fact datum be about we life you just you log on to you social networking site you favorite one you say this be my friend Bing Relationship Data you say this photograph it be about it depict this person bing that be datum datum datum datum every time you do thing on the social networking site the social networking site be take datum and use it re purpose it and use it to make other person life more interesting on the site but when you go to another link data site and let say this be one about travel and you say I want to send this photo to all the person in that group you can not get over the wall the economist write a article about it and lot of person have blogg about it tremendous frustration the way to break down the silo be to get inter operability between social networking site we need to do that with link datum one last type of datum I will talk about maybe it be the most exciting before I come down here I look it up on OpenStreetMap the OpenStreetMap a map but it be also a Wiki Zoom in and that square thing be a theater which we be in right now the Terrace Theater it do not have a name on it so I could go into edit mode I could select the theater I could add down at the bottom the name and I could save it back and now if you go back to the OpenStreetMap org and you find this place you will find that the Terrace Theater have get a name I do that I I do that to the map I just do that I put that up on there hey you know what if I that street map be all about everybody do they bit and it create a incredible resource because everybody else do theirs and that be what link datum be all about it be about person do they bit to produce a little bit and it all connect that be how link datum work you do you bit everybody else do theirs you may not have lot of datum which you have yourself to put on there but you know to demand it and we have practice that so link datum it be huge I have only tell you a very small number of thing there be datum in every aspect of we life every aspect of work and pleasure and it be not just about the number of place where datum come it be about connect it together and when you connect datum together you get power in a way that do not happen just with the web with document you get this really huge power out of it so we be at the stage now where we have to do this the person who think it be a great idea and all the person and I think there be a lot of person at TED who do thing because even though there be not a immediate return on the investment because it will only really pay off when everybody else have do it they will do it because they be the sort of person who just do thing which would be good if everybody else do they ok so it be call link datum I want you to make it I want you to demand it and I think it be a idea worth spread thanks applause
