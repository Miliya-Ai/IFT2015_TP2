so a big question that we be face now and have be for quite a number of year now be we at risk of a nuclear attack now there be a big question that be probably actually more important than that be the notion of permanently eliminate the possibility of a nuclear attack eliminate the threat altogether and I would like to make a case to you that over the year since we first develop atomic weaponry until this very moment we have actually live in a dangerous nuclear world that be characterize by two phase which I be go to go through with you right now first of all we start off the nuclear age in 1945 the United States have develop a couple of atomic weapon through the Manhattan Project and the idea be very straightforward we would use the power of the atom to end the atrocity and the horror of this unending World War II that we have be involve in in Europe and in the Pacific and in 1945 we be the only nuclear power we have a few nuclear weapon two of which we drop on Japan in Hiroshima a few day later in Nagasaki in August 1945 kill about 250 000 person between that two and for a few year we be the only nuclear power on Earth but by 1949 the Soviet Union have decide it be unacceptable to have we as the only nuclear power and they begin to match what the United States have develop and from 1949 to 1985 be a extraordinary time of a buildup of a nuclear arsenal that no one could possibly have imagine back in the 1940 so by 1985 each of that red bomb up here be equivalent of a thousand warhead the world have 65 000 nuclear warhead and seven member of something that come to be know as the nuclear club and it be a extraordinary time and I be go to go through some of the mentality that we that American and the rest of the world be experience but I want to just point out to you that 95 percent of the nuclear weapon at any particular time since 1985 go forward of course be part of the arsenal of the United States and the Soviet Union after 1985 and before the break up of the Soviet Union we begin to disarm from a nuclear point of view we begin to counter proliferate and we drop the number of nuclear warhead in the world to about a total of 21 000 it be a very difficult number to deal with because what we have do be we have quote unquote decommission some of the warhead they be still probably usable they could be re commission but the way they count thing which be very complicated we think we have about a third of the nuclear weapon we have before but we also in that period of time add two more member to the nuclear club Pakistan and North Korea so we stand today with a still fully armed nuclear arsenal among many country around the world but a very different set of circumstance so I be go to talk about a nuclear threat story in two chapter chapter one be 1949 to 1991 when the Soviet Union break up and what we be deal with at that point and through that year be a superpower nuclear arm race it be characterize by a nation versus nation very fragile standoff and basically we live for all that year and some might argue that we still do in a situation of be on the brink literally of a apocalyptic planetary calamity it be incredible that we actually live through all that we be totally dependent during that year on this amazing acronym which be mad it stand for mutually assure destruction so it mean if you attack we we would attack you virtually simultaneously and the end result would be a destruction of you country and mine so the threat of my own destruction keep I from launch a nuclear attack on you that be the way we live and the danger of that of course be that a misreading of a radar screen could actually cause a counter launch even though the first country have not actually launch anything during this chapter one there be a high level of public awareness about the potential of nuclear catastrophe and a indelible image be implant in we collective mind that in fact a nuclear holocaust would be absolutely globally destructive and could in some way mean the end of civilization as we know it so this be chapter one now the odd thing be that even though we know that there would be that kind of civilization obliteration we engage in America in a series and in fact in the Soviet Union in a series of response planning it be absolutely incredible so premise one be we would be destroy the world and then premise two be why do not we get prepare for it so what we offer ourselves be a collection of thing I be just go to go skim through a few thing just to jog you memory if you be bear after 1950 this be just consider this entertainment otherwise it be memory lane this be Bert the Turtle Video this be basically a attempt to teach we schoolchildren that if we do get engage in a nuclear confrontation and atomic war then we want we school child to kind of basically duck and cover that be the principle you there would be a nuclear conflagration about to hit we and if you get under you desk thing would be ok laughter I do not do all that well in psychiatry in medical school but I be interested and I think this be seriously delusional laughter secondly we tell person to go down in they basement and build a fallout shelter maybe it would be a study when we be not have a atomic war or you could use it as a tv room or as many teenager find out a very very safe place for a little privacy with you girlfriend and actually so there be multiple use of the bomb shelter or you could buy a prefabricated bomb shelter that you could simply bury in the ground now the bomb shelter at that point let say you buy a prefab one it would be a few hundred dollar maybe up to 500 if you get a fancy one yet what percentage of American do you think ever have a bomb shelter in they house what percentage live in a house with a bomb shelter less than two percent about 1 4 percent of the population as far as anyone know do anything either make a space in they basement or actually build a bomb shelter many building public building around the country this be New York City have this little civil defense sign and the idea be that you would run into one of this shelter and be safe from the nuclear weaponry and one of the great governmental delusion of all time be something that happen in the early day of the Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA as we now know and be well aware of they behavior from Katrina here be they first big public announcement they would propose actually there be about six volume write on this a crisis relocation plan that be dependent upon the United States have three to four day warn that the Soviets be go to attack we so the goal be to evacuate the target city we would move person out of the target city into the countryside and I be tell you I actually testify at the Senate about the absolute ludicrous idea that we would actually evacuate and actually have three or four day warning it be just completely off the wall turn out that they have another idea behind it even though this be they be tell the public it be to save we the idea be that we would force the Soviets to be target they nuclear weapon very expensive and potentially double they arsenal to not only take out the original site but take out site where person be go this be what apparently as it turn out be behind all this it be just really really frightening the main point here be we be deal with a complete disconnect from reality the civil defense program be disconnect from the reality of what we have see in all out nuclear war so organization like Physicians for Social responsibility around 1979 start say this a lot publicly they would do a bombing run they would go to you city and they would say here be a map of you city here be what be go to happen if we get a nuclear hit so no possibility of medical response to or meaningful preparedness for all out nuclear war so we have to prevent nuclear war if we expect to survive this disconnect be never actually resolve and what happen be when we get in to chapter two of the nuclear threat era which start back in 1945 chapter two start in 1991 when the Soviet Union break up we effectively lose that adversary as a potential attacker of the United States for the most part it be not completely go I be go to come back to that but from 1991 through the present time emphasize by the attack of 2001 the idea of a all out nuclear war have diminish and the idea of a single event act of nuclear terrorism be what we have instead although the scenario have change very considerably the fact be that we have not change we mental image of what a nuclear war mean so I be go to tell you what the implication of that be in just a second so what be a nuclear terror threat and there be four key ingredient to describe that first thing be that the global nuclear weapon in the stockpile that I show you in that original map happen to be not uniformly secure and it be particularly not secure in the former Soviet Union now in Russia there be many many site where warhead be store and in fact lot of site where fissionable material like highly enriched uranium and plutonium be absolutely not safe they be available to be buy steal whatever they be acquirable let I put it that way from 1993 through 2006 the International Atomic Energy Agency document 175 case of nuclear theft 18 of which involved highly enriched uranium or plutonium the key ingredient to make a nuclear weapon the global stockpile of highly enriched uranium be about 1 300 at the low end to about 2 100 metric ton more than 100 megaton of this be store in particularly insecure Russian facility how much of that do you think it would take to actually build a 10 kiloton bomb well you need about 75 pound of it so what I would like to show you be what it would take to hold 75 pound of highly enriched uranium this be not a product placement it be just in fact if I be Coca Cola I would be pretty distressed about this laughter but basically this be it this be what you would need to steal or buy out of that 100 metric ton stockpile that be relatively insecure to create the type of bomb that be use in Hiroshima now you might want to look at plutonium as another fissionable material that you might use in a bomb that you would need 10 to 13 pound of plutonium now plutonium 10 to 13 pound this this be enough plutonium to create a Nagasaki size atomic weapon now this situation already I you know I do not really like think about this although somehow I get myself a job where I have to think about it so the point be that we be very very insecure in term of develop this material the second thing be what about the know how and there be a lot of controversy about whether terror organization have the know how to actually make a nuclear weapon well there be a lot of know how out there there be a unbelievable amount of know how out there there be detailed information on how to assemble a nuclear weapon from part there be book about how to build a nuclear bomb there be plan for how to create a terror farm where you could actually manufacture and develop all the component and assemble it all of this information be relatively available if you have a undergraduate degree in physics I would suggest although I do not so maybe it be not even true but something close to that would allow you with the information that be currently available to actually build a nuclear weapon the third element of the nuclear terror threat be that who would actually do such a thing well what we be see now be a level of terrorism that involve individual who be highly organized they be very dedicated and committed they be stateless somebody once say Al Qaeda do not have a return address so if they attack we with a nuclear weapon what be the response and to whom be the response and they be retaliation proof since there be no real retribution possible that would make any difference since there be person willing to actually give up they life in order to do a lot of damage to we it become apparent that the whole notion of this mutually assure destruction would not work here be Sulaiman Abu Ghaith and Sulaiman be a key lieutenant of Osama Bin Laden He write many many time statement to this effect we have the right to kill four million American two million of whom should be child and we do not have to go overseas to find person willing to do harm for whatever they reason McVeigh and Nichols and the Oklahoma City attack in the 1990 be a good example of homegrown terrorist what if they have get they hand on a nuclear weapon the fourth element be that the high value U S target be accessible soft and plentiful this would be a talk for another day but the level of the preparedness that the United States have achieve since 9 11 of 01 be unbelievably inadequate what you see after Katrina be a very good indicator of how little prepared the United States be for any kind of major attack seven million ship cargo container come into the United States every year five to seven percent only be inspect five to seven percent this be Alexander Lebed who be a general that work with Yeltsin who talk about and present to Congress this idea that the Russian have develop this suitcase bomb they be very low yield 0 1 to one kiloton Hiroshima be around 13 kiloton but enough to do a unbelievable amount of damage and Lebed come to the United States and tell we that many many more than 80 of the suitcase bomb be actually not accountable and they look like this they be basically very simple arrangement you put the element into a suitcase it become very portable the suitcase can be conveniently drop in you trunk of you car you take it wherever you want to take it and you can detonate it you do not want to build a suitcase bomb and you happen to get one of that insecure nuclear warhead that exist this be the size of the little boy bomb that be drop at Hiroshima it be 9 8 foot long weigh 8 800 pound you go down to you local rent a truck and for 50 buck or so you rent a truck that be get the right capacity and you take you bomb you put it in the truck and you be ready to go it could happen but what it would mean and who would survive you can not get a exact number for that kind of probability but what I be try to say be that we have all the element of that happen anybody who dismiss the thought of a nuclear weapon be use by a terrorist be kid themselves I think there be a lot of person in the intelligence community a lot of person who deal with this work in general think it be almost inevitable unless we do certain thing to really try to defuse the risk like good interdiction good prevention good fixing you know well screening of cargo container that be come into the country and so forth there be a lot that can be do to make we a lot safe at this particular moment we actually could end up see a nuclear detonation in one of we city I do not think we would see a all out nuclear war any time soon although even that be not completely off the table there be still enough nuclear weapon in the arsenal of the superpower to destroy the Earth many many time over there be flash point in India and Pakistan in the Middle East in North Korea other place where the use of nuclear weapon while initially locally could very rapidly go into a situation where we would be face all out nuclear war it be very unsettling here we go ok I be back in my truck and we drive over the Brooklyn Bridge we be come down and we bring that truck that you just see somewhere in here in the Financial District this be a 10 kiloton bomb slightly small than be use in Hiroshima and I want to just conclude this by just give you some information I think news you could use kind of concept here so first of all this would be horrific beyond anything we can possibly imagine this be the ultimate and if you be in the half mile radius of where this bomb go off you have a 90 percent chance of not make it if you be right where the bomb go off you will be vaporize and that be I be just tell you this be not good laughter you assume that two mile radius you have a 50 percent chance of be kill and up to about eight mile away now I be talk about kill instantly somewhere between a 10 and 20 percent chance of get kill the thing about this be that the experience of the nuclear detonation be first of all ten of million of degree Fahrenheit at the core here where it go off and a extraordinary amount of energy in the form of heat acute radiation and blast effect a enormous hurricane like wind and destruction of building almost totally within this yellow circle here and what I be go to focus on as I come to conclusion here be that what happen to you if you be in here well if we be talk about the old day of a all out nuclear attack you up here be as dead as the person here so it be a moot point my point now though be that there be a lot that we could do for you who be in here if you have survive the initial blast you have when the blast go off and by the way if it ever come up do not look at it laughter if you look at it you be go to be blind either temporarily or permanently so if there be any way that you can avoid like avert you eye that would be a good thing if you find yourself alive but you be in the vicinity of a nuclear weapon you have that be go off you have 10 to 20 minute depend on the size and exactly where it go off to get out of the way before a lethal amount of radiation come straight down from the mushroom cloud that go up in that 10 to 15 minute all you have to do and I mean this seriously be go about a mile away from the blast and what happen be this be I be go to show you now some fallout plume within 20 minute it come straight down within 24 hour lethal radiation be go out with prevail wind and it be mostly in this particular direction it be go northeast and if you be in this vicinity you have get to get away so you be feel the wind and there be tremendous wind now that you be go to be feel and you want to go perpendicular to the wind not upwind or downwind if you be in fact able to see where the blast be in front of you you have get to get out of there if you do not get out of there you be go to be expose to lethal radiation in very short order if you can not get out of there we want you to go into a shelter and stay there now in a shelter in a urban area mean you have to be either in a basement as deep as possible or you have to be on a floor on a high floor if it be a ground burst explosion which it would be high than the ninth floor so you have to be tenth floor or high or in the basement but basically you have get to get out of town as quickly as possible and if you do that you actually can survive a nuclear blast over the next few day to a week there will be a radiation cloud again go with the wind and settle down for another 15 or 20 mile out in this case over Long Island and if you be in the direct fallout zone here you really have to either be shelter or you have to get out of there and that be clear but if you be shelter you can actually survive the difference between know information of what you be go to do personally and not know information can save you life and it could mean the difference between 150 000 to 200 000 fatality from something like this and half a million to 700 000 fatality so response planning in the twenty first century be both possible and be essential but in 2008 there be not one single American city that have do effective plan to deal with a nuclear detonation disaster part of the problem be that the emergency planner themselves personally be overwhelmed psychologically by the thought of nuclear catastrophe they be paralyzed you say nuclear to they and they be think oh my God we be all go what be the point it be futile and we be try to tell they it be not futile we can change the survival rate by do some commonsensical thing so the goal here be to minimize fatality and I just want to leave you with the personal point that I think you might be interested in the key to survive a nuclear blast be get out and not go into harm way that be basically all we be go to be talk about here and the far you be away in distance the long it be in time from the initial blast and the more separation between you and the outside atmosphere the good so separation hopefully with dirt or concrete or be in a basement distance and time be what will save you so here be what you do First of all as I say do not stare at the light flash if you can I do not know you could possibly resist do that but let assume theoretically you want to do that you want to keep you mouth open so you eardrum do not burst from the pressure if you be very close to what happen you actually do have to duck and cover like Bert tell you Bert the Turtle and you want to get under something so that you be not injure or kill by object if that be at all possible you want to get away from the initial fallout mushroom cloud I say in just a few minute and shelter and place you want to move only crosswind for 1 2 mile you know if you be out there and you see building horribly destroy and down in that direction less destroy here then you know that it be over there the blast and you be go this way as long as you be go crosswise to the wind once you be out and evacuate you want to keep as much of you skin you mouth and nose cover as long as that covering do not impede you move and get out of there and finally you want to get decontaminate as soon as possible and if you be wear clothing you have take off you clothing you be go to get shower down some place and remove the radiation that would be the radioactive material that might be on you and then you want to stay in shelter for 48 to 72 hour minimum but you be go to wait hopefully you will have you little wind up battery less radio and you will be wait for person to tell you when it be safe to go outside that be what you need to do in conclusion nuclear war be less likely than before but by no mean out of the question and it be not survivable nuclear terrorism be possible it may be probable but be survivable and this be Jack Geiger who be one of the hero of the U S public health community and Jack say the only way to deal with nuclear anything whether it be war or terrorism be abolition of nuclear weapon and you want something to work on once you have fix global warming I urge you to think about the fact that we have to do something about this unacceptable inhumane reality of nuclear weapon in we world now this be my favorite civil defense slide and I laughter I do not want to be indelicate but this he be no long in office we do not really care ok this be send to I by somebody who be a aficionado of civil defense procedure but the fact of the matter be that America go through a very hard time we have not be focus we have not do what we have to do and now we be face the potential of bad hell on Earth thank you
