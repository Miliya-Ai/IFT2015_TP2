aside from keep the rain out and produce some usable space architecture be nothing but a special effect machine that delight and disturb the sens we work be across media the work come in all shape and size it be small and large this be a ashtray a water glass from urban planning and master planning to theater and all sort of stuff the thing that all the work have in common be that it challenge the assumption about convention of space and this be everyday convention convention that be so obvious that we be blind by they familiarity and I have assemble a sampling of work that all share a kind of productive nihilism that be use in the service of create a particular special effect and that be something like nothing or something next to nothing it be do through a form of subtraction or obstruction or interference in a world that we naturally sleepwalk through this be a image that win we a competition for a exhibition pavilion for the Swiss expo 2002 on Lake Neuchatel near Geneva and we want to use the water not only as a context but as a primary building material we want to make a architecture of atmosphere so no wall no roof no purpose just a mass of atomized water a big cloud and this proposal be a reaction to the over saturation of emergent technology in recent national and world exposition which feed or have be feed we insatiable appetite for visual stimulation with a ever great digital virtuosity high definition in we opinion have become the new orthodoxy and we ask the question can we use technology high technology to make a expo pavilion that be decidedly low definition that also challenge the convention of space and skin and rethink we dependence on vision so this be how we seek to do it Water pump from the lake and be filter and shoot as a fine mist through a array of high pressure fog nozzle 35 000 of they and a weather station be on the structure it read the shifting condition of temperature humidity wind direction wind speed dew point and it process this data in a central computer that calibrate the degree of water pressure and distribution of water throughout and it be a responsive system that be train on actual weather so this be just in construction and there be a tensegrity structure it be about 300 foot wide the size of a football field and it sit on just four very delicate column this be the fog nozzle the interface and basically the system be kind of read the real weather and produce kind of semi artificial and real weather so we be very interested in create weather I do not know why now here we go one side the outside and then from the inside of the space you can see what the quality of the space be unlike enter any normal space enter blur be like step into a habitable medium it be formless featureless depthless scaleless massless purposeless and dimensionless all reference be erase leave only a optical whiteout and white noise of the pulsing nozzle so this be a exhibition pavilion where there be absolutely nothing to see and nothing to do and we pride ourselves it be a spectacular anti spectacle in which all the convention of spectacle be turn on they head so the audience be disperse focused attention and dramatic build up and climax be all replace by a kind of attenuate attention that be sustain by a sense of apprehension cause by the fog and this be very much like how the Victorian novel use fog in this way so here the world be put out of focus while we visual dependence be put into focus the public you know once disoriented can actually ascend to the angel deck above and then just come down under that lip into the water bar so all the water of the world be serve there so we think that you know after be at the water and move through the water and breathe the water you could also drink this building and so it be sort of a theme but it go a little bit you know deep than that we really want to bring out we absolute dependence on this master sense and maybe share we kind of sensibility with we other sens you know when we do this project it be a kind of tough sell because the Swiss say well why be we go to spend you know 10 million dollar produce a effect that we already have in natural abundance that we hate and you know we think well we try to convince they and in the end you know they adapt this as a national icon that come to represent Swiss doubt which we you know it be kind of a meaning machine that everybody kind of lay on they own meaning off of anyway it be a temporary structure that be ultimately destroy and so it be now a memory of a apparition actually but it continue to live in edible form and this be the high honor to be bestow upon a architect in Switzerland to have a chocolate bar anyway move along so in the 80 and 90 we be mostly know for independent work such as installation artist architect commission project by museum and non for profit organization and we do a lot of media work also a lot of experimental theater project in 2003 the Whitney mount a retrospective of we work that feature a lot of this work from the 80 and 90 however the work itself resist the very nature of a retrospective and this be just some of the stuff that be in the show this be a piece on tourism in the United States this be soft sell for 42nd Street this be something do at the Cartier Foundation Master Slave at the MOMA the project series a piece call Parasite and so there be many many of this kind of project anyway they give we the whole fourth floor and you know the problem of the retrospective be something we be very uncomfortable with it be a kind of invention of the museum that be suppose to bring a kind of cohesive understanding to the public of a body of work and we work do not really resolve itself into a body in any way at all and one of the recur theme by the way that in the work be a kind of hostility toward the museum itself and ask about the convention of the museum like the wall the white wall so what you see here be basically a plan of many installation that be put there and we actually have to install white wall to separate this piece which do not belong together but this white wall become a kind of target and weapon at the same time we use the wall to partition the 13 installation of the project and produce a kind of acoustic and visual separation and what you see be actually the red dot line show the track of this perform element which be a new piece that create that we create for the which be a robotic drill basically that go all the way around cruise the museum go all around the wall and do a lot of damage so the drill be mount on this robotic arm we work with by the way Honeybee Robotics this be the brain Honeybee Robotics design the Mars Driller and it be really very much fun to work with they they be not do they primary work which be for the government while they be help we with this in any case the way it work be that a intelligent navigator basically map the entire surface of this wall so unfold it be about 300 linear foot and it randomly generate point within a three dimensional matrix it select a point it guide the drill to that point it pierce the dry wall leave a half inch hole before travel to the next location initially this hole be lone blemish and as the exhibition continue the wall become increasingly perforated so eventually hole on both side of the wall align opening view from gallery to gallery cluster of hole randomly open up section of wall and so this be a three month performance piece in which the wall be make into kind of a increasingly unstable element and also the acoustic separation be destroy also the visual separation and there be also this constant background groan which be very annoying and this be one of the blackout space where there be a video piece that become totally not useful so rather than secure a neutral background for the artwork on display the wall now actively compete for attention and this acoustical nuisance and visual nuisance basically expose the discomfort of the work to this encompass nature of the retrospective it be really great when it start to break up all of the curatorial text move along to a project that we finish about a year ago it be the ICA the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston which be on the waterfront and there be not enough time to really introduce the building but I will simply say that the building negotiate between this outwardly focused nature of the site you know it be a really great waterfront site in Boston and this contradictory other desire to have a inwardly focused museum so the nature of the building be that it look at look I mean that be its primary objective both its program and its architectural conceit the building incorporate the site but it dispense it in very small dose in the way that the museum be choreographed so you come in and you be basically squeeze by the theater by the belly of the theater into this very compressed space where the view be turn off then you come up in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall this elevator about the size of a New York City studio apartment and then this be a view go up and then you could come into the theater which can actually deny the view or open it up and become a backdrop and many musician choose to use the theater glass wall totally open the view be deny in the gallery where we receive just natural light and then expose again in the north gallery with a panoramic view the original intention of this space which be unfortunately never realize be to use lenticular glass which allow only a kind of perpendicular view out in this very narrow space that connect east and west gallery the intention be really to not get a climax but to have the view stalk you so the view would open up as you walk from one end to the other this be eliminate because the view be too good and the mayor say no we just want this open the architect lose here but culminate and that be where this hook into the theme of my little talk be this Mediatheque which be suspend from the cantilever portion of the building so this be a 80 foot cantilever it be quite substantial so it be already stick out into space enough and then from that be this be this small area call the Mediatheque the Mediatheque have something like 16 station where the public can get onto the server and look at digital artwork or also curate artwork off the web and this be really a kind of very important part of this building and here be a point where architecture this be like technology free architecture be only a frame device it only edit the harbor view the industrial harbor just through its wall its floor and its ceiling to only expose the water itself the texture of water much like a hypnotic effect create by electronic snow or a lava lamp or something like that and here be where we really feel that there be a great convergence of the technological and the natural in the project but there be just no information it be just it be just hypnosis move along to Lincoln Center this be the guy that do the project in the first place 50 year ago we be take over now do work that range in scale from small scale repair to major renovation and major facility expansion but we be do it with a lot less testosterone this be the extent of the work that be to be complete by 2010 and for the purpose of this talk I want to isolate just a part of a project that be even a part of a project that touch a little bit on this theme of architectural special effect and it happen to be we current obsession and it play a little bit with the purging and add of distraction it be Alice Tully Hall and it be tuck under the Juilliard Building and descend several level under the street so this be the entrance to Tully Hall as it use to be before the renovation which we just start and we ask ourselves why could not it be exhibitionistic like the Met or like some of the other building at Lincoln Center and one of the thing that we be ask to do be give it a street identity expand the lobby and make it visually accessible and this building which be just naturally hermetic we strip we basically do a striptease architectural striptease where we be frame with this kind of canopy the underside of three level of expansion of Juilliard about 45 000 square foot cut it to the angle of Broadway and then expose use that canopy to frame Tully Hall before and after shot applause wait a minute it be just in that state we have a long way to go but what I want to do be take a couple of second that I have leave to just talk about the hall itself which be kind of where we be really do a massive amount of work so the hall be a multi purpose hall the client have ask we to produce a great chamber music hall now that be really tough to do with a hall that have 1 100 seat Chamber and the notion of chamber have to do with salon and small scale performance they ask we to bring a intimacy how do you bring a intimacy into a hall intimacy for we mean a lot of different thing it mean acoustic intimacy and it mean visual intimacy one thing be that the subway be run and rumble right under the hall another thing that could be fix be the shape of the hall it be like a coffin it basically send all the sound like a gutter ball effect down the aisle the wall be make of absorptive surface half absorptive half reflective which be not very good for concert sound this be Avery Fisher Hall but the notion of junk visual junk be very very important to we to get rid of visual noise because we can not eliminate a single seat the architecture be restrict to 18 inch so it be a very very thin architecture first we do a kind of partial box and box separation to take away the distraction of the subway noise next we wrap the entire hall almost like this Olivetti keyboard with a material with a wood material that basically cover all the surface wall ceiling floor stage step everything box but it be acoustically engineer to focus the sound into the house and back to the stage and here be a acoustic shelf look up the hall just a section of the stage just everything be line it incorporate every single thing that you could possibly imagine be tuck into this high performance skin but one more add feature so now that we have strip the hall of all visual distraction everything that prevent this intimacy which be suppose to connect the house the audience with the performer we add one little detail one piece of architectural excess a special effect lighting we very strongly believe that the theatric of a concert hall be as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival as it be when the concert start so what we want to do be produce this effect this lighting effect which make we have to bioengineer the wood wall and what it entail be the use of resin of this very thick resin with a veneer of the same kind of wood that be use throughout the hall in a kind of seamless continuity that wrap the hall in light like a belt of light rather than separate like a proscenium would separate the audience from performer it connect audience with player and this be a mockup that be in Salt Lake City that give you a sense of what this be go to look like in full scale and this be a guy from Salt Lake City this be what they look like out there laughter and for we I mean it be really kind of a very strange thing but the moment in the hall that the buzz kind of die down when the audience be wait for the performance to begin very similar to the parting of curtain or the raising of a chandelier the wall will just exude this glow temporarily steal attention from the stage and this be Tully in construction now I have no ending to say except that I be a couple of minute over thank you very much applause
