shit this be arguably the back end of the design of animal laughter but the reason I put this up here be because when I be in Africa last year my wife and I be drive around we have this wonderful guide who show we something that surprise both of we and it be very revealing in term of the fascination that come with the design of animal it turn out that in about the 1880 the missionary come to Africa to spread the word of Christianity to teach English to the native and they bring blackboard and chalk and I would like you to imagine that that be a blackboard and I just use some chalk on there and they bring quite a bit of this stuff but over the year the blackboard be fine but they run out of chalk and this be a real crisis for they and that be where the hyena come in the hyena be probably the most perfectly design scavenge animal in the world it strip mine carcass and it have amazing tooth because it enable the hyena to essentially eat bone now the end product of that action be up on the board here what the missionary would do be they have walk around and they would pick up hyena shit and the incredible thing about hyena shit be it make great chalk laughter that be not what I be here to talk about but it be a fascinating aspect of animal design what I be here to talk about be the camel when I start talk to Richard about what I be go to speak about I have recently come back from Jordan where I have a amazing experience with a camel laughter and we be in the desert Richard Wurman that be the end Keith Bellows yeah yeah we be in the desert in Wadi Rum in a small jeep there be four of we two Bedouin driver you can just imagine this expanse be a ocean of sand 105 degree one water bottle and we be drive in what they tell we be they very very good jeep do not look like it to I and as we start to go through the desert the Jeep break down the guy get out they put the hood up they start work under the hood get it go again about a hundred yard it break down this go on about 6 7 time we be get more and more alarmed we be also get deep and deep into the desert and eventually we bad nightmare happen they flood the engine and they say ah no problem we just get out and walk and we say we get out and walk one water bottle remember guy four person and they say yeah yeah we will walk we will find some camel we get out and walk and sure enough about half a mile we come over the crest of this hill and there be a huge gathering of Bedouin with they camel the guy go up and start dicker and 10 dollar later we have four camel they go down like elevator we get on they they go back up and the Bedouin each Bedouin four of they get behind each of the camel with a little whip and they start slash away at the back of the camel and they start gallop and if you have ever be on a camel it be a very very uncomfortable ride there be also one other aspect about this camel about every 10 step they lean back and try to take a chunk out of you leg laughter so we keep on go and this camel keep on try to take a chunk out of my leg and eventually three mile later we arrive at we destination where a jeep be suppose to meet we and the camel come down again like elevator we sort of clumsily get off and they obviously try to take another chunk out of my leg and I have develop a very wonderful relationship with this creature by this point and I have realize that this be a mean son of a bitch and much mean by the way than the Bedouin who greet I and try to sell I one of he 26 daughter to take back to the States so as we talk Richard and I I say you know maybe I should bring a camel it be the good design animal in the world he go Nah I do not think we want to be bring a camel and you should be really glad we decide not to bring the camel so I do the next good thing I go to the Washington Zoo Richard say I want you to get up close and personal with this camel I want you to inspect its mouth look at its tooth go underneath it go above it go around it pull its tail up take a look in there I want you to get as close to that camel as you possibly can so I get a National Geographic film crew we go down there and I take one look at this camel it be a 2 000 pound creature who be in rut laughter now if you have ever see a 2 000 pound camel in rut it be a scary scary thing to behold and if Richard think I be get in the ring with that camel someone be smoke Bedouin high grade laughter so we get as close to it as possible and I be go to share this Chris if you want to roll this film then I be go to show you a little bit more about the design of camel do you want to roll the film adventure music video hello this be Keith Bellows with the TED National Geographic Camel Investigation Unit I be here to look at the ultimate desert machine music continue Keith Bellows and you will note I start chew gum because I be around this camel all day video that be it ok no see now he be get a little overexcited so we will need to be very careful around he do not let he get you now you can see copious amount of saliva in there I always call myself the unstable stable boy they nose you can see he nose be flare right now when they be in rut they be similar to seal in the way like a seal have to open its nose to breathe and they be similar they have to consciously open they nose kb ear SK they be small but they have excellent hearing but not big for instance in zebra they have a huge ear that be very mobile so they can actually turn they both around and they use they in the same way we use we binocular vision they use that to pinpoint sound the desert extremely windy as well as be very cold so not only do they have the very long eyelash but there be the secondary I guess you would call it the unclear or whatever it be this hair that be above the eye and below it it be long most person think that the hump store water they do not they store fat now I be not a chemist but basically what happen be the fat be oxidize by they breathe and that will turn it into actually usable water like a lot of predator they walk on they toe but there be a big fat pad in there that squish out they be like sun shoe but you know with sand hoof they do not have traditional hoof but they do have one like big nail audience laughter you can not really see too clear the fur kind of grow over but they use they tail a lot especially in rut he will urinate and spin he tail to spread the urine around and make he more attractive I do not know why that would be but it work for they so what the hell audience laughter now they will also defecate in certain area generally they poop wherever they want to but during they rut they will defecate in perimeter area I do not know if you have read or hear about the sub sonic sound from elephant you know what I mean like Br be be this big big rumble sound he will do the same thing you can actually see right here it will vibrate we weigh we animal unfortunately he be a very aggressive animal so he be actually destroy some of the scale we have this big thing that I weigh the bison on for instance I be guess that he be at least 1 600 pound but I would put he close to 2 000 he be basically a walk mulch pile we be kind of like bud but I be also a male as well KB he see you as competition senior keeper yeah exactly and it make he very dangerous at this time of year do not even think about it do not think about it but now we be go to meet out out out no out music applause kb what I do not show you be you get that swinging thing go well and you be glad I do not show you this one of the other thing about the camel beautiful design be that its penis point backwards that way the camel can dip its tail in the stream and just whacker the entire area around he and that be how he really mark he territory now what you also do not see be that and you may have notice in the pen beside he and by the way the camel name be Suki in the pen beside he be Jasmine Jasmine have be he mate for some time but on this particular occasion it be very very clear that as horny as Suki be Jasmine be have none of it and so we start think well if poor old Suki be in search of a mate what would Suki do to find the perfect mate I be go to show you another film but before I do I just want to mention that this animal truly be a sort of the suv of the sand the ship of the desert it be so vital to the inhabitant of the area in which the camel be find largely Mongolia and Sahara that there be 160 word in Arabic to describe the camel and if this be a creature that be design by committee it be certainly be like no committee I have ever be on so here be what Suki would do in search of a mate can you roll it please Camel seek camel lusty beast desire attractive and sincere mate I be seven foot 2 000 lb with brown hair and eye long leg and I be very well hung I be TED Camel the perfect desert machine I be smartly design eyelash that keep out sand and a third eyelash that work like a windshield wiper a distinguished nose with nostril line to filter out sand and dust and a groove that catch moisture amazingly full lip that allow I to eat practically anything that grow callouse on my knee that let I kneel comfortably leathery chest pad that beat the heat short fur that keep my skin cool long leg that allow heat to escape and my hump Ogden Nash once write the camel have a single hump the dromedary two or else the other way around I be never sure be you here be a hint bactarian dromedary my hump contain up to 80 lb of fat but do not store h2o I be build to last I be the go to animal when the oasis be dry I usually will not sweat until my body reach 105 F enough to fry a egg I be able to lose 40 of my weight without die most animal would if they lose half that much I will drink 5 to 7 gallon of water a day but go without for more than a month I be powerful able to pack up to 400 lb of cargo Outrun a horse and cover 26 mile on a good day Camelot Jackie o once say that travel by camel make ride a elephant seem like take a jet plane yet my large soft foot allow I to navigate sand be that why the Bedouin claim I can dance I be a good provider too Bedouins call the camel the gift of God no surprise tent and rug be make of my hair my dry bone be prize as a sort of ivory my dung be burn as fuel my milk be use for cheese camel be like angel a Bedouin once say applause thank you I just want to leave you with one last thought which be probably the most important thing to take away human the animal be pretty lucky creature because by and large we really do not have to adapt to we environment we adapt we environment to we and we have see that repeatedly through this conference not just this year but in past year but this creature that you have just see ultimately adapt and keep adapt and adapt I think when you look at the animal kingdom that be one of the most remarkable thing it do not have a environment that adapt to it it have to adapt to the environment Ricky thank you very much for have I rw that be terrific thank you
