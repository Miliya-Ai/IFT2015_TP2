I want to talk today about I have be ask to take the long view and I be go to tell you what I think be the three big problem for humanity from this long point of view some of this have already be touch upon by other speaker which be encourage it seem that there be not just one person who think that this problem be important the first be death be a big problem if you look at the statistics the odds be not very favorable to we so far most person who have live have also die roughly 90 percent of everybody who have be alive have die by now so the annual death rate add up to 150 000 sorry the daily death rate 150 000 person per day which be a huge number by any standard the annual death rate then become 56 million if we just look at the single big cause of death age it account for roughly two third of all human person who die that add up to a annual death toll of great than the population of Canada sometimes we do not see a problem because either it be too familiar or it be too big can not see it because it be too big I think death might be both too familiar and too big for most person to see it as a problem once you think about it you see this be not statistical point this be let see how far have I talk I have talk for three minute so that would be roughly 324 person have die since I have begin speak person like it be roughly the population in this room have just die now the human cost of that be obvious once you start to think about it the suffer the loss it be also economically enormously wasteful I just look at the information and knowledge and experience that be lose due to natural cause of death in general and age in particular suppose we approximate one person with one book now of course this be a underestimation a person lifetime of learning and experience be a lot more than you could put into a single book but let suppose we do this 52 million person die of natural cause each year correspond then to 52 million volume destroy Library of Congress hold 18 million volume we be upset about the burning of the Library of Alexandria it be one of the great cultural tragedy that we remember even today but this be the equivalent of three library of Congress burn down forever lose each year so that be the first big problem and I wish Godspeed to Aubrey de Grey and other person like he to try to do something about this as soon as possible existential risk the second big problem existential risk be a threat to human survival or to the long term potential of we species now why do I say that this be a big problem well let first look at the probability and this be very very difficult to estimate but there have be only four study on this in recent year which be surprising you would think that it would be of some interest to try to find out more about this give that the stake be so big but it be a very neglect area but there have be four study one by John Lesley write a book on this he estimate a probability that we will fail to survive the current century 50 percent similarly the astronomer Royal whom we hear speak yesterday also have a 50 percent probability estimate another author do not give any numerical estimate but say the probability be significant that it will fail I write a long paper on this I say assign a less than 20 percent probability would be a mistake in light of the current evidence we have now the exact figure here we should take with a big grain of salt but there seem to be a consensus that the risk be substantial everybody who have look at this and study it agree now if we think about what just reduce the probability of human extinction by just one percentage point not very much so that be equivalent to 60 million life save if we just count the currently live person the current generation now one percent of six billion person be equivalent to 60 million so that be a large number if we be to take into account future generation that will never come into existence if we blow ourselves up then the figure become astronomical if we could eventually colonize a chunk of the universe the Virgo supercluster maybe it will take we 100 million year to get there but if we go extinct we never will then even a one percentage point reduction in the extinction risk could be equivalent to this astronomical number 10 to the power of 32 so if you take into account future generation as much as we own every other moral imperative of philanthropic cost just become irrelevant the only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk because even the tiny decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve and even if you just look at the current person and ignore the potential that would be lose if we go extinct it should still have a high priority now let I spend the rest of my time on the third big problem because it be more subtle and perhaps difficult to grasp think about some time in you life some person might never have experience it but some person there be just that moment that you have experience where life be fantastic it might have be at the moment of some great creative inspiration you might have have when you just enter this flow stage or when you understand something you have never do before or perhaps in the ecstasy of romantic love or a aesthetic experience a sunset or a great piece of art every once in a while we have this moment and we realize just how good life can be when it be at its good and you wonder why can not it be like that all the time you just want to cling onto this and then of course it drift back into ordinary life and the memory fade and it be really difficult to recall in a normal frame of mind just how good life can be at its good or how bad it can be at its bad the third big problem be that life be not usually as wonderful as it could be I think that be a big big problem it be easy to say what we do not want here be a number of thing that we do not want illness involuntary death unnecessary suffering cruelty stunt growth memory loss ignorance absence of creativity suppose we fix this thing we do something about all of this we be very successful we get rid of all of this thing we might end up with something like this which be I mean it be a heck of a lot good than that but be this really the good we can dream of be this the good we can do or be it possible to find something a little bit more inspiring to work towards and if we think about this I think it be very clear that there be way in which we could change thing not just by eliminate negative but add positive on my wish list at least would be much long healthy life great subjective well be enhance cognitive capacity more knowledge and understanding unlimited opportunity for personal growth beyond we current biological limit well relationship a unbounded potential for spiritual moral and intellectual development if we want to achieve this what in the world would have to change and this be the answer we would have to change not just the world around we but we ourselves not just the way we think about the world but the way we be we very biology human nature would have to change now when we think about change human nature the first thing that come to mind be this human modification technology growth hormone therapy cosmetic surgery stimulant like Ritalin Adderall anti depressant anabolic steroid artificial heart it be a pretty pathetic list they do great thing for a few person who suffer from some specific condition but for most person they do not really transform what it be to be human and they also all seem a little bit most person have this instinct that well sure there need to be anti depressant for the really depressed person but there be a kind of queasiness that this be unnatural in some way it be worth recall that there be a lot of other modification technology and enhancement technology that we use we have skin enhancement clothing as far as I can see all of you be user of this enhancement technology in this room so that be a great thing Mood modifier have be use from time immemorial caffeine alcohol nicotine immune system enhancement vision enhancement anesthetic we take that very much for grant but just think about how great progress that be like have a operation before anesthetic be not fun contraceptive cosmetic and brain reprogramming technique that sound ominous but the distinction between what be a technology a gadget would be the archetype and other way of change and rewrite human nature be quite subtle so if you think about what it mean to learn arithmetic or to learn to read you be actually literally rewrite you own brain you be change the microstructure of you brain as you go along so in a broad sense we do not need to think about technology as only little gadget like this thing here but even institution and technique psychological method and so forth Forms of organization can have a profound impact on human nature look ahead there be a range of technology that be almost certain to be develop soon or late we be very ignorant about what the time scale for this thing be but they all be consistent with everything we know about physical law law of chemistry etc it be possible to assume set aside a possibility of catastrophe that sooner or later we will develop all of this and even just a couple of this would be enough to transform the human condition so let look at some of the dimension of human nature that seem to leave room for improvement health span be a big and urgent thing because if you be not alive then all the other thing will be to little avail intellectual capacity let take that box which fall into a lot of different sub category memory concentration mental energy intelligence empathy this be really great thing part of the reason why we value this trait be that they make we well at compete with other person they be positional goods but part of the reason and that be the reason why we have ethical ground for pursue this be that they be also intrinsically valuable it be just good to be able to understand more of the world around you and the person that you be communicate with and to remember what you have learn Modalities and special faculty now the human mind be not a single unitary information processor but it have a lot of different special evolve module that do specific thing for we if you think about what we normally take as give life a lot of its meaning music humor eroticism spirituality aesthetics nurture and care gossip chat with person all of this very likely be enable by a special circuitry that we human have but that you could have another intelligent life form that lack this we be just lucky that we have the requisite neural machinery to process music and to appreciate it and enjoy it all of this would enable in principle be amenable to enhancement some person have a good musical ability and ability to appreciate music than other have it be also interesting to think about what other thing be so if this all enable great value why should we think that evolution have happen to provide we with all the modality we would need to engage with other value that there might be imagine a species that just do not have this neural machinery for processing music and they would just stare at we with bafflement when we spend time listen to a beautiful performance like the one we just hear because of person make stupid movement and they would be really irritated and would not see what we be up to but maybe they have another faculty something else that would seem equally irrational to we but they actually tap into some great possible value there but we be just literally deaf to that kind of value so we could think of add on different new sensory capacity and mental faculty bodily functionality and morphology and affective self control Greater subjective well be be able to switch between relaxation and activity be able to go slow when you need to do that and to speed up able to switch back and forth more easily would be a neat thing to be able to do easy to achieve the flow state when you be totally immerse in something you be do conscientiousness and sympathy the ability to it be another interesting application that would have large social ramification perhaps if you could actually choose to preserve you romantic attachment to one person undiminished through time so that would not have to love would never have to fade if you do not want it to that be probably not all that difficult it might just be a simple hormone or something that could do this it be be do in voles you can engineer a prairie vole to become monogamous when it be naturally polygamous it be just a single gene might be more complicated in human but perhaps not that much this be the last picture that I want to now we have get to use the laser pointer a possible mode of be here would be a way of life a way of be experience think see interact with the world down here in this little corner here we have the little sub space of this large space that be accessible to human being being with we biological capacity it be a part of the space that be accessible to animal since we be animal we be a subset of that and then you can imagine some enhancement of human capacity there would be different mode of be you could experience if you be able to stay alive for say 200 year then you could live sort of life and accumulate wisdom that be just not possible for human as we currently be so then you move off to this large sphere of human and you could continue that process and eventually explore a lot of this large space of possible mode of be now why be that a good thing to do well we know already that in this little human circle there there be this enormously wonderful and worthwhile mode of be human life at its good be wonderful we have no reason to believe that within this much much large space there would not also be extremely worthwhile mode of be perhaps one that would be way beyond we wildest ability even to imagine or dream about and so to fix this third problem I think we need slowly carefully with ethical wisdom and constraint develop the means that enable we to go out in this large space and explore it and find the great value that might hide there thanks
