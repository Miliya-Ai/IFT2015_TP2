thank you it be really a honor and a privilege to be here spend my last day as a teenager today I want to talk to you about the future but first I be go to tell you a bit about the past my story start way before I be bear my grandmother be on a train to Auschwitz the death camp and she be go along the track and the track split and somehow we do not really know exactly the whole story but the train take the wrong track and go to a work camp rather than the death camp my grandmother survive and marry my grandfather they be live in Hungary and my mother be bear and when my mother be two year old the Hungarian revolution be rage and they decide to escape Hungary they get on a boat and yet another divergence the boat be either go to Canada or to Australia they get on and do not know where they be go and end up in Canada so to make a long story short they come to Canada my grandmother be a chemist she work at the Banting Institute in Toronto and at 44 she die of stomach cancer I never meet my grandmother but I carry on she name she exact name Eva Vertes and I like to think I carry on she scientific passion too I find this passion not far from here actually when I be nine year old my family be on a road trip and we be in the Grand Canyon and I have never be a reader when I be young my dad have try I with the hardy Boys I try Nancy Drew I try all that and I just do not like read book and my mother buy this book when we be at the Grand Canyon call the Hot Zone it be all about the outbreak of the Ebola virus and something about it just kind of draw I towards it there be this big sort of bumpy look virus on the cover and I just want to read it I pick up that book and as we drive from the edge of the Grand Canyon to Big Sur and to actually here where we be today in Monterey I read that book and from when I be read that book I know that I want to have a life in medicine I want to be like the explorer I would read about in the book who go into the jungle of Africa go into the research lab and just try to figure out what this deadly virus be so from that moment on I read every medical book I could get my hand on and I just love it so much I be a passive observer of the medical world it be not until I enter high school that I think maybe now you know be a big high school kid I can maybe become a active part of this big medical world I be 14 and I email professor at the local university to see if maybe I could go work in they lab and hardly anyone respond but I mean why would they respond to a 14 year old anyway and I get to go talk to one professor Dr Jacobs who accept I into the lab at that time I be really interested in neuroscience and want to do a research project in neurology specifically look at the effect of heavy metal on the develop nervous system so I start that and work in he lab for a year and find the result that I guess you would expect to find when you feed fruit fly heavy metal that it really really impair the nervous system the spinal cord have break the neuron be cross in every which way and from then I want to look not at impairment but at prevention of impairment so that be what lead I to Alzheimer I start read about Alzheimer and try to familiarize myself with the research and at the same time when I be in the I be read in the medical library one day and I read this article about something call purine derivative and they seem to have cell growth promote property and be naive about the whole field I kind of think oh you have cell death in Alzheimer which be cause the memory deficit and then you have this compound purine derivative that be promote cell growth and so I think maybe if it can promote cell growth it can inhibit cell death too and so that be the project that I pursue for that year and it be continue now as well and find that a specific purine derivative call guanidine have inhibit the cell growth by approximately 60 percent so I present that result at the International Science Fair which be just one of the most amazing experience of my life and there I be award good in the World in Medicine which allow I to get in or at least get a foot in the door of the big medical world and from then on since I be now in this huge exciting world I want to explore it all I want it all at once but know I could not really get that and I stumble across something call cancer stem cell and this be really what I want to talk to you about today about cancer at first when I hear of cancer stem cell I do not really know how to put the two together I would hear of stem cell and I would hear of they as the panacea of the future the therapy of many disease to come in the future perhaps but I would hear of cancer as the most feared disease of we time so how do the good and bad go together last summer I work at Stanford University do some research on cancer stem cell and while I be do this I be read the cancer literature try to again familiarize myself with this new medical field and it seem that tumor actually begin from a stem cell this fascinate I the more I read the more I look at cancer differently and almost become less fearful of it it seem that cancer be a direct result to injury if you smoke you damage you lung tissue and then lung cancer arise if you drink you damage you liver and then liver cancer occur and it be really interesting there be article correlate if you have a bone fracture and then bone cancer arise because what stem cell be they be this phenomenal cell that really have the ability to differentiate into any type of tissue so if the body be sense that you have damage to a organ and then it be initiate cancer it be almost as if this be a repair response and the cancer the body be say the lung tissue be damage we need to repair the lung and cancer be originate in the lung try to repair because you have this excessive proliferation of this remarkable cell that really have the potential to become lung tissue but it be almost as if the body have originate this ingenious response but can not quite control it it have not yet become fine tune enough to finish what have be initiate so this really really fascinate I and I really think that we can not think about cancer let alone any disease in such black and white term if we eliminate cancer the way we be try to do now with chemotherapy and radiation we be bombard the body or the cancer with toxin or with radiation try to kill it it be almost as if we be get back to this starting point we be remove the cancer cell but we be reveal the previous damage that the body have try to fix should not we think about manipulation rather than elimination if somehow we can cause this cell to differentiate to become bone tissue lung tissue liver tissue whatever that cancer have be put there to do it would be a repair process we have end up good than we be before cancer so this really change my view of look at cancer and while I be read all this article about cancer it seem that the article a lot of they focus on you know the genetics of breast cancer and the genesis and the progression of breast cancer track the cancer through the body trace where it be where it go but it strike I that I would never hear of cancer of the heart or cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter and skeletal muscle constitute 50 percent of we body or over 50 percent of we body and so at first I kind of think well maybe there be some obvious explanation why skeletal muscle do not get cancer at least not that I know of so I look further into it find as many article as I could and it be amazing because it turn out that it be very rare some article even go as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue be resistant to cancer and furthermore not only to cancer but of metastase go to skeletal muscle and what metastase be be when the tumor when a piece break off and travel through the blood stream and go to a different organ that be what a metastasis be it be the part of cancer that be the most dangerous if cancer be localize we could likely remove it or somehow you know it be contain it be very contain but once it start move throughout the body that be when it become deadly so the fact that not only do cancer not seem to originate in skeletal muscle but cancer do not seem to go to skeletal muscle there seem to be something here so this article be say you know skeletal metastasis to skeletal muscle be very rare but it be leave at that no one seem to be ask why so I decide to ask why at first the first thing I do be I email some professor who specialize in skeletal muscle physiology and pretty much say hey it seem like cancer do not really go to skeletal muscle be there a reason for this and a lot of the reply I get be that muscle be terminally differentiate tissue mean that you have muscle cell but they be not divide so it do not seem like a good target for cancer to hijack but then again this fact that the metastase do not go to skeletal muscle make that seem unlikely and furthermore that nervous tissue brain get cancer and brain cell be also terminally differentiate so I decide to ask why and here be some of I guess my hypothesis that I will be start to investigate this May at the Sylvester Cancer Institute in Miami and I guess I will keep investigate until I get the answer but I know that in science once you get the answer inevitably you be go to have more question so I guess you could say that I will probably be do this for the rest of my life some of my hypothesis be that when you first think about skeletal muscle there be a lot of blood vessel go to skeletal muscle and the first thing that make I think be that blood vessel be like highway for the tumor cell tumor cell can travel through the blood vessel and you think the more highway there be in a tissue the more likely it be to get cancer or to get metastase so first of all I think you know would not it be favorable to cancer get to skeletal muscle and as well cancer tumor require a process call angiogenesis which be really the tumor recruit the blood vessel to itself to supply itself with nutrient so it can grow without angiogenesis the tumor remain the size of a pinpoint and it be not harmful so angiogenesis be really a central process to the pathogenesis of cancer and one article that really stand out to I when I be just read about this try to figure out why cancer do not go to skeletal muscle be that it have report 16 percent of micro metastase to skeletal muscle upon autopsy 16 percent mean that there be this pinpoint tumor in skeletal muscle but only 16 percent of actual metastase suggest that maybe skeletal muscle be able to control the angiogenesis be able to control the tumor recruit this blood vessel we use skeletal muscle so much it be the one portion of we body we heart always beat we be always move we muscle be it possible that muscle somehow intuitively know that it need this blood supply it need to be constantly contract so therefore it be almost selfish it be grab its blood vessel for itself therefore when a tumor come into skeletal muscle tissue it can not get a blood supply and can not grow so this suggest that maybe if there be a anti angiogenic factor in skeletal muscle or perhaps even more a angiogenic routing factor so it can actually direct where the blood vessel grow this could be a potential future therapy for cancer and another thing that be really interesting be that there be this whole the way tumor move throughout the body it be a very complex system and there be something call the chemokine network and chemokine be essentially chemical attractant and they be the stop and go signal for cancer so a tumor express chemokine receptor and another organ a distant organ somewhere in the body will have the correspond chemokine and the tumor will see this chemokine and migrate towards it be it possible that skeletal muscle do not express this type of molecule and the other really interesting thing be that when skeletal muscle there be be several report that when skeletal muscle be injure that be what correlate with metastase go to skeletal muscle and furthermore when skeletal muscle be injure that be what cause chemokine this signal say cancer you can come to I the go sign for the tumor it cause they to highly express this chemokine so there be so much interplay here I mean there be so many possibility for why tumor do not go to skeletal muscle but it seem like by investigate by attack cancer by search where cancer be not there have get to be something there be get to be something that be make this tissue resistant to tumor and can we utilize can we take this property this compound this receptor whatever it be that be control this anti tumor property and apply it to cancer therapy in general now one thing that kind of tie the resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer to the cancer as a repair response go out of control in the body be that skeletal muscle have a factor in it call myod and what myod essentially do be it cause cell to differentiate into muscle cell so this compound myod have be test on a lot of different cell type and be show to actually convert this variety of cell type into skeletal muscle cell so be it possible that the tumor cell be go to the skeletal muscle tissue but once in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue myod act upon this tumor cell and cause they to become skeletal muscle cell maybe tumor cell be be disguise as skeletal muscle cell and this be why it seem as if it be so rare it be not harmful it have just repair the muscle muscle be constantly be use constantly be damage if every time we tear a muscle or every time we stretch a muscle or move in a wrong way cancer occur I mean everybody would have cancer almost and I hate to say that but it seem as though muscle cell possibly because of all its use have adapt fast than other body tissue to respond to injury to fine tune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process which the body want to finish I really believe that the human body be very very smart and we can not counteract something the body be say to do it be different when a bacterium come into the body that be a foreign object we want that out but when the body be actually initiate a process and we be call it a disease it do not seem as though elimination be the right solution so even to go from there it be possible although far fetch that in the future we could almost think of cancer be use as a therapy if that disease where tissue be deteriorate for example Alzheimer where the brain the brain cell die and we need to restore new brain cell new functional brain cell what if we could in the future use cancer a tumor put it in the brain and cause it to differentiate into brain cell that be a very far fetch idea but I really believe that it may be possible this cell be so versatile this cancer cell be so versatile we just have to manipulate they in the right way and again some of this may be far fetch but I figure if there be anywhere to present far fetch idea it be here at TED so thank you very much applause
