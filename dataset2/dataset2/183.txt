I hope you will understand my English in the morning it be terrible and the afternoon be bad laughter during many year I make some speech start with this say City be not a problem it be a solution and more and more I be convince that it be not only a solution for a country but it be a solution for the problem of climate change but we have a very pessimistic approach about the city I be work in city for almost 40 year and where every mayor be try to tell I he city be so big or the other mayor say we do not have financial resource I would like to say from the experience I have every city in the world can be improve in less than three year there be no matter of scale it be not a question of scale it be not a question of financial resource every problem in a city have to have its own equation of co responsibility and also a design so to start I want to introduce some character from a book I make for teenager the good example of quality of life be the turtle because the turtle be a example of live and work together and when you realize that the casque of the turtle look like a urban tessitura and can we imagine if we cut the casque of the turtle how sad she be go to be and that be what we be do in we city live here work here have leisure here and most of the person be leave the city and live outside of the city so the other character be Otto the automobile he be invite for a party he never want to leave the chair be on the table and still drink and he drink a lot laughter and he cough a lot very egotistical he carry only one or two person and he ask always for more infrastructure freeway he be a very demanding person and on the other hand Accordion the friendly bus he carry 300 person 275 in Sweden 300 Brazilian laughter speak about the design every city have its own design Curitiba my city three million in the metropolitan area 1 800 000 person in the city itself Curitiba Rio it be like two bird kiss themselves Oaxaca San Francisco it be very easy Market Street Van Ness and the waterfront and every city have its own design but to make it happen sometimes you have to propose a scenario and to propose a design a idea that everyone or the large majority will help you to make it happen and that be the structure of the city of Curitiba and it be a example of live and work together and this be where we have more density it be where we have more public transport so this system start in 74 we start with 25 000 passenger a day now it be 2 200 000 passenger a day and it take 25 year until another city which be Bogota and they do a very good job and now there be 83 city all over the world that they be do what they call the BRT of Curitiba and one thing it be important not for only you own city every city besides its normal problem they have a very important role in be with the whole humanity that mean mostly two main issue mobility and sustainability be become very important for the city and this be a articulated bus double articulate and we be very close to my house you can come when you be in Curitiba and have a coffee there and that be the evolution of the system what in the design that make the difference be the boarding tube the boarding tube give to the bus the same performance as a subway that be why I be try to say it be like metro nize the bus this be the design of the bus and you can pay before enter the bus you be board and for handicapped they can use this as a normal system what I be try to say be the major contribution on carbon emission be from the car more than 50 percent so when we depend only on car it be that be why when we be talk about sustainability it be not enough green building it be not enough a new material it be not enough new source of energy it be the concept of the city the design of the city that be also important too and also how to teach the child I will speak on this later on we idea of mobility be try to make the connection between all the system we start in 83 propose for the city of Rio how to connect the subway with the bus the subway be against of course and 23 year after they call we to develop we be develop this idea and you can understand how different it be go to be the image of Rio with the system one minute frequency and it be not Shanghai it be not be color during the day only at night it will look this way and before you say it be a Norman Foster design we design this in 83 and this be the model how it be go to work so it be the same system the vehicle be different and that be the model what I be try to say be I be not try to prove which system of transport be good I be try to say we have to combine all the system and with one condition never if you have a subway if you have surface system if you have any kind of system never compete in the same space and come back to the car I always use to say that the car be like you mother in law you have to have good relationship with she but she can not command you life so when the only woman in you life be you mother in law you have a problem laughter so all the idea about how to transform through design old quarry and open university and botanic garden all of it be relate to how we teach the child and the child we teach during six month how to separate they garbage and after the child teach they parent and now we have 70 percent since 20 year it be the high rate of separation of garbage in the world seven zero applause so teach the child I would like to say if we want to have a sustainable world we have to work with everything what be say but do not forget the city and the child I be work in a museum and also a multi use city because you can not have empty place during 18 hour a day you should have always a structure of live and work together try to understand the sector in the city that could play different role during the 24 hour another issue be a city like we family portrait we do not rip we family portrait even if we do not like the nose of we uncle because this portrait be you and this be the reference that we have in any city this be the main pedestrian mall we do it in 72 hour yes you have to be fast and this be the reference from we ethnic contribution this be the Italian portal the ukrainian park the Polish park the Japanese square the German park all of a sudden the Soviet Union they split and since we have person from Uzbekistan Kazakhstan Tajikistan unclear we have to stop the program laughter do not forget creativity start when you cut a zero from you budget if you cut two zero it be much good and this be the Wire Opera theater we do it in two month Parks old quarry that they be transform into park quarry once make the nature and sometimes we take this and we transform and every part can be transform every frog can be transform in a prince so in a city you have to work fast plan take time and I be propose urban acupuncture that mean I with some focal idea to help the normal process of plan and this be a acupuncture note or I M Pei some small one can make the city well the small park in New York the most beautiful 32 meter so I want just to end say that you can always propose new material new sustainable material but keep in mind that we have to work fast to the end because we do not have the whole time to plan and I think creativity innovation be start and we can not have all the answer so when you start and we can not be so prepotent on have all the answer it be important starting and have the contribution from person and they could teach you if you be not in the right track at the end I would like if you can help I to sing the sustainable song ok please allow I just two minute you be go to make the music and the rhythm Toonchi too Toonchi too Toonchi too Toonchi too Toonchi too Toonchi too it be possible it be possible you can do it you can do it use less you car make this decision avoid carbon emission it be possible it be possible you can do it you can do it live close to work work close to home Save energy in you home it be possible it be possible you can do it you can do it separate you garbage Organic schmorganic Save more Waste less it be possible you can do it please do it now thank you applause
