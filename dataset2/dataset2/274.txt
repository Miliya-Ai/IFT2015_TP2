I have a tough job to do you know when I look at the profile of the audience here with they connotation and design in all its form and with so much and so many person work on collaborative and network and so on that I want to tell you I want to build a argument for primary education in a very specific context in order to do that in 20 minute I have to bring out four idea it be like four piece of a puzzle and if I succeed in do that maybe you would go back with the thought that you could build on and perhaps help I do my work the first piece of the puzzle be remoteness and the quality of education now by remoteness I mean two or three different kind of thing of course remoteness in its normal sense which mean that as you go far and far away from a urban center you get to remoter area what happen to education the second or a different kind of remoteness be that within the large metropolitan area all over the world you have pocket like slum or shantytown or poor area which be socially and economically remote from the rest of the city so it be we and they what happen to education in that context so keep both of that idea of remoteness we make a guess the guess be that school in remote area do not have good enough teacher if they do have they can not retain that teacher they do not have good enough infrastructure and if they have some infrastructure they have difficulty maintain it but I want to check if this be true so what I do last year be we hire a car look up on Google find a route into northern India from New Delhi which you know which do not cross any big city or any big metropolitan center drive out about 300 kilometer and wherever we find a school administer a set of standard test and then take that test result and plot they on a graph the graph be interesting although you need to consider it carefully I mean this be a very small sample you should not generalize from it but it be quite obvious quite clear that for this particular route that I have take the remote the school be the bad its result seem to be that seem a little damning and I try to correlate it with thing like infrastructure or with the availability of electricity and thing like that to my surprise it do not correlate it do not correlate with the size of classroom it do not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure it do not correlate with the poverty level it do not correlate but what happen be that when I administer a questionnaire to each of this school with one single question for the teacher which be would you like to move to a urban metropolitan area 69 percent of they say yes and as you can see from that they say yes just a little bit out of Delhi and they say no when you hit the rich suburb of Delhi because you know that be relatively good off area and then from 200 kilometer out of Delhi the answer be consistently yes I would imagine that a teacher who come or walk into class every day think that I wish I be in some other school probably have a deep impact on what happen to the result so it look as though teacher motivation and teacher migration be a powerfully correlate thing with what be happen in primary school as oppose to whether the child have enough to eat and whether they be pack tightly into classroom and that sort of thing it appear that way when you take education and technology then I find in the literature that you know thing like website collaborative environment you have be listen to all that in the morning it be always pilot first in the good school the good urban school and accord to I bias the result the literature one part of it the scientific literature consistently blame ET as be over hype and under perform the teacher always say well it be fine but it be too expensive for what it do because it be be pilot in a school where the student be already get let say 80 percent of whatever they could do you put in this new super duper technology and now they get 83 percent so the principal look at it and say 3 percent for 300 000 dollar forget it if you take the same technology and pilot it into one of that remote school where the score be 30 percent and let say take that up to 40 percent that will be a completely different thing so the relative change that ET Educational Technology would make would be far great at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top but we seem to be do it the other way about so I come to this conclusion that ET should reach the underprivileged first not the other way about and finally come the question of how do you tackle teacher perception whenever you go to a teacher and show they some technology the teacher first reaction be you can not replace a teacher with a machine it be impossible I do not know why it be impossible but even for a moment if you do assume that it be impossible I have a quotation from Sir Arthur C Clarke the science fiction writer whom I meet in Colombo and he say something which completely solve this problem he say a teacher than can be replace by a machine should be so you know it put the teacher into a tough bind you have to think anyway so I be propose that a alternative primary education whatever alternative you want be require where school do not exist where school be not good enough where teacher be not available or where teacher be not good enough for whatever reason if you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this apply then you do not need a alternative education so far I have not come across such a area except for one case I will not name the area but somewhere in the world person say we do not have this problem because we have perfect teacher and perfect school there be such area but anyway I would never hear that anywhere else I be go to talk about child and self organization and a set of experiment which sort of lead to this idea of what might a alternative education be like they be call the hole in the wall experiment I will have to really rush through this they be a set of experiment the first one be do in New Delhi in 1999 and what we do over there be pretty much simple I have a office in that day which border a slum a urban slum so there be a divide wall between we office and the urban slum they cut a hole inside that wall which be how it have get the name hole in the wall and put a pretty powerful pc into that hole sort of embed into the wall so that its monitor be stick out at the other end a touchpad similarly embed into the wall put it on high speed internet put the internet explorer there put it on Altavista com in that day and just leave it there and this be what we see so that be my office in IIT here be the hole in the wall about eight hour later we find this kid to the right be this eight year old child who and to he left be a six year old girl who be not very tall and what he be do be he be teach she to browse so it sort of raise more question than it answer be this real do the language matter because he be not suppose to know English will the computer last or will they break it and steal it and do anyone teach they the last question be what everybody say but you know I mean they must have poke they head over the wall and ask the person in you office can you show I how to do it and then somebody teach he so I take the experiment out of Delhi and repeat it this time in a city call Shivpuri in the center of India where I be assure that nobody have ever teach anybody anything laughter so it be a warm day and the hole in the wall be on that decrepit old building this be the first kid who come there he later on turn out to be a 13 year old school dropout he come there and he start to fiddle around with the touchpad very quickly he notice that when he move he finger on the touchpad something move on the screen and later on he tell I I have never see a television where you can do something so he figure that out it take he over two minute to figure out that he be do thing to the television and then as he be do that he make a accidental click by hit the touchpad you will see he do that he do that and the internet explorer change page eight minute late he look from he hand to the screen and he be browsing he be go back and forth when that happen he start call all the neighborhood child like child would come and see what be happen over here and by the evening of that day 70 child be all browsing so eight minute and a embed computer seem to be all that we need there so we think that this be what be happen that child in group can self instruct themselves to use a computer and the Internet but under what circumstance at this time there be a the main question be about English person say you know you really ought to have this in Indian language so I say have what shall I translate the internet into some Indian language that be not possible so it have to be the other way about but let see how do the child tackle the English language I take the experiment out to northeastern India to a village call Madantusi where for some reason there be no English teacher so the child have not learn English at all and I build a similar hole in the wall one big difference in the village as oppose to the urban slum there be more girl than boy who come to the kiosk in the urban slum the girl tend to stay away I leave the computer there with lot of cd I do not have any internet and come back three month later so when I come back there I find this two kid eight and 12 year old who be play a game on the computer and as soon as they see I they say we need a fast processor and a good mouse laughter I be real surprised you know how on earth do they know all this and they say well we have pick it up from the cd so I say but how do you understand what be go on over there so they say well you have leave this machine which talk only in English so we have to learn English so then I measure and they be use 200 English word with each other mispronounce but correct usage word like exit stop find save that kind of thing not only to do with the computer but in they day to day conversation so Madantusi seem to show that language be not a barrier in fact they may be able to teach themselves the language if they really want to finally I get some funding to try this experiment out to see if this result be replicable if they happen everywhere else India be a good place to do such a experiment in because we have all the ethnic diversity all the you know the genetic diversity all the racial diversity and also all the socio economic diversity so I could actually choose sample to cover a cross section that would cover practically the whole world so I do this for almost five year and this experiment really take we all the way across the length and breadth of India this be the Himalayas up in the north very cold I also have to check or invent a engineering design which would survive outdoors and I be use regular normal pc so I need different climate for which India be also great because we have very cold very hot and so on this be the desert to the west near the Pakistan border and you see here a little clip of one of this village the first thing that this child do be to find a website to teach themselves the English alphabet then to central India very warm moist fishing village where humidity be a very big killer of electronics so we have to solve all the problem we have without air conditioning and with very poor power so most of the solution that come out use little blast of air put at the right place to keep the machine run I want to just cut this short we do this over and over again this sequence be also nice this be a small child a six year old tell he eld sister what to do and this happen very often with this computer that the young child be find teach the old one what do we find we find that six to 13 year old can self instruct in a connected environment irrespective of anything that we could measure so if they have access to the computer they will teach themselves include intelligence I could not find a single correlation with anything but it have to be in group and that may be of great you know interest to this group because all of you be talk about group so here be the power of what a group of child can do if you lift the adult intervention just a quick idea of the measurement we take standard statistical technique so I be go to not talk about that but we get a clean learning curve almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school I will leave it at that because I mean it sort of say it all do not it what could they learn to do Basic Windows function browsing painting chat and email game and educational material music download play video in short what all of we do and over 300 child will become computer literate and be able to do all of this thing in six month with one computer so how do they do that if you calculate the actual time of access it would work out to minute per day so that be not how it be happen what you have actually be there be one child operate the computer and surround he be usually three other child who be advise he on what they should do if you test they all four will get the same score in whatever you ask they around this four be usually a group of about 16 child who be also advise usually wrongly about everything that be go on on the computer and all of they also will clear a test give on that subject so they be learn as much by watch as they learn by do it seem counter intuitive to adult learning but remember eight year old live in a society where most of the time they be tell do not do this you know do not touch the whiskey bottle so what do the eight year old do he observe very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touch and if you test he he would answer every question correctly on that topic so they seem to be able to acquire very quickly so what be the conclusion over the six year of work it be that primary education can happen on its own or part of it can happen on its own it do not have to be impose from the top downwards it could perhaps be a self organize system so that be the second bit that I want to tell you that child can self organize and attain a educational objective the third piece be on value and again to put it very briefly I conduct a test over 500 child spread across all over India and ask they I give they about 68 different value orient question and simply ask they they opinion we get all sort of opinion yes no or I do not know I simply take that question where I get 50 percent yes and 50 percent no so I be able to get a collection of 16 such statement this be area where the child be clearly confused because half say yes and half say no a typical example be sometimes it be necessary to tell lie they do not have a way to determine which way to answer this question perhaps none of we do so I leave you with this third question can technology alter the acquisition of value finally self organize system about which again I will not say too much because you have be hear all about it natural system be all self organize galaxy molecule cell organism society except for the debate about a intelligent designer but at this point in time as far as science go it be self organization but other example be traffic jam stock market society and disaster recovery terrorism and insurgency and you know about the internet base self organize system so here be my four sentence then Remoteness affect the quality of education Educational technology should be introduce into remote area first and other area later value be acquire doctrine and dogma be impose the two oppose mechanism and learning be most likely a self organize system if you put all the four together then it give accord to I it give we a goal a vision for educational technology a educational technology and pedagogy that be digital automatic fault tolerant minimally invasive connected and self organize as educationist we have never ask for technology we keep borrow it PowerPoint be suppose to be consider a great educational technology but it be not mean for education it be mean for make boardroom presentation we borrow it Video conferencing the personal computer itself I think it be time that the educationist make they own spec and I have such a set of spec this be a brief look at that and such a set of spec should produce the technology to address remoteness value and violence so I think I would give it a name why do not we call it outdoctrination and could this be a goal for educational technology in the future so I want to leave that as a thought with you thank you applause
