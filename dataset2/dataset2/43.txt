I be Michael Shermer director of the Skeptics Society publisher of Skeptic magazine we investigate claim of the paranormal pseudo science fringe group and cult and claim of all kind between science and pseudo science and non science and junk science voodoo science pathological science bad science non science and plain old non sense and unless you have be on Mars recently you know there be a lot of that out there some person call we debunker which be kind of a negative term but let face it there be a lot of bunk we be like the bunko squad of the police department out there well we be sort of like the Ralph Naders of bad idea laughter try to replace bad idea with good idea I will show you a example of a bad idea I bring this with I this be give to we by NBC Dateline to test it be produce by the Quadro Corporation of West Virginia it be call the Quadro 2000 Dowser rod laughter this be be sell to high school administrator for 900 apiece it be a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attach to it you could dowse for all sort of thing but this particular one be build to dowse for marijuana in student locker laughter so the way it work be you go down the hallway and you see if it tilt toward a particular locker and then you open the locker so it look something like this I will show you laughter well it have kind of a right lean bias well this be science so we will do a control experiment it will go this way for sure laughter Sir do you want to empty you pocket please sir laughter so the question be can it actually find marijuana in student locker and the answer be if you open enough of they yes laughter applause but in science we have to keep track of the miss not just the hit and that be probably the key lesson to my short talk here this be how psychic work astrologer tarot card reader and so on person remember the hit and forget the miss in science we keep the whole database and look to see if the number of hit somehow stand out from the total number you would expect by chance in this case we test it we have two opaque box one with government approve THC marijuana and one with nothing and it get it 50 percent of the time laughter which be exactly what you would expect with a coin flip model so that be just a fun little example here of the sort of thing we do skeptic be the quarterly publication each one have a particular theme this one be on the future of intelligence be person get smart or dumb I have a opinion of this myself because of the business I be in but in fact person it turn out be get smart three iq point per 10 year go up sort of a interesting thing with science do not think of skepticism as a thing or science as a thing be science and religion compatible it be like be science and plumbing compatible they be just two different thing Science be not a thing it be a verb it be a way of think about thing it be a way of look for natural explanation for all phenomenon I mean what be more likely that extraterrestrial intelligence or multi dimensional being travel across vast distance of interstellar space to leave a crop circle in Farmer Bob field in Puckerbrush Kansas to promote skeptic com we web page or be it more likely that a reader of skeptic do this with Photoshop and in all case we have to ask laughter what be the more likely explanation before we say something be out of this world we should first make sure that it be not in this world what be more likely that Arnold have extraterrestrial help in he run for the governorship or that the World Weekly News make stuff up laughter the same theme be express nicely here in this Sidney Harris cartoon for that of you in the back it say here then a miracle occur I think you need to be more explicit here in step two this single slide completely dismantle the intelligent design argument there be nothing more to it than that applause you can say a miracle occur it be just that it do not explain anything or offer anything there be nothing to test it be the end of the conversation for intelligent design creationist and it be true scientist sometimes throw term out as linguistic place filler dark energy or dark matter something like that until we figure out what it be we will call it this it be the beginning of the causal chain for science for intelligent design creationist it be the end of the chain so again we can ask this what be more likely be ufo alien spaceship or perceptual cognitive mistake or even fake this be a UFO shot from my house in Altadena California look down over Pasadena and if it look a lot like a Buick hubcap it be because it be you do not even need photoshop or high tech equipment you do not need computer this be shoot with a throwaway Kodak Instamatic camera you just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go Camera ready that be it laughter so although it be possible that most of this thing be fake or illusion or so on and that some of they be real it be more likely that all of they be fake like the crop circle on a more serious note in all of science we be look for a balance between datum and theory in the case of Galileo he have two problem when he turn he telescope to Saturn First of all there be no theory of planetary ring second of all he datum be grainy and fuzzy and he could not quite make out what he be look at so he write that he have see I have observe that the furth planet have three body and this be what he end up conclude that he see so without a theory of planetary ring and with only grainy datum you can not have a good theory it be not solve until 1655 this be Christiaan Huygens book that catalog all the mistake person make try to figure out what be go on with Saturn it be not till Huygens have two thing he have a good theory of planetary ring and how the solar system operate and he have good telescopic more fine grain datum in which he could figure out that as the Earth be go around fast accord to Kepler law than Saturn then we catch up with it and we see the angle of the ring at different angle there and that in fact turn out to be true the problem with have a theory be that it may be load with cognitive bias so one of the problem of explain why person believe weird thing be that we have thing on a simple level and then I will go to more serious one like we have a tendency to see face this be the face on Mars in 1976 where there be a whole movement to get NASA to photograph that area because person think this be monumental architecture make by Martian here be the close up of it from 2001 if you squint you can still see the face and when you be squint you be turn that from fine grain to coarse grain so you be reduce the quality of you datum and if I do not tell you what to look for you would still see the face because we be program by evolution to see face face be important for we socially and of course happy face face of all kind be easy to see you see the happy face on Mars there laughter if astronomer be frog perhaps they have see Kermit the Frog do you see he there little froggy leg or if geologist be elephant religious iconography laughter discover by a Tennessee baker in 1996 he charge five buck a head to come see the nun bun till he get a cease and desist from Mother Teresa lawyer here be we lady of Guadalupe and we lady of Watsonville just down the street or be it up the street from here Tree bark be particularly good because it be nice and grainy branchy black and white splotchy and you can get the pattern seek human be pattern seek animal here be the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sao Paulo here be when the Virgin Mary make she appearance on a cheese sandwich which I get to actually hold in a Las Vegas casino of course this be America laughter this casino pay 28 500 on eBay for the cheese sandwich laughter but who do it really look like the Virgin Mary laughter it have that sort of puckered lip 1940 era look virgin Mary in Clearwater Florida I actually go to see this one there be a lot of person there the faithful come in they wheelchair and crutch and so on we go down and investigate just to give you a size that be Dawkins I and the amazing Randi next to this two two and a half story sized image all this candle thousand of candle person have light in tribute to this so we walk around the backside to see what be go on it turn out wherever there be a sprinkler head and a palm tree you get the effect here be the Virgin Mary on the backside which they start to wipe off I guess you can only have one miracle per building laughter so be it really a miracle of Mary or be it a miracle of Marge laughter and now I be go to finish up with another example of this with auditory illusion there be this film white noise with Michael Keaton about the dead talk back to we by the way the whole business of talk to the dead be not that big a deal anybody can do it turn out it be get the dead to talk back that be the really hard part laughter in this case supposedly this message be hide in electronic phenomena there be a ReverseSpeech com web page where I download this stuff this be the most famous one of all of this here be the forward version of the very famous song music with lyric if there be a bustle in you hedgerow do not be alarm now it be just a spring clean for the May Queen yes there be two path you can go by but in the long run there be still time to change the road you be on music end could not you just listen to that all day all right here it be backwards and see if you can hear the hidden message that be supposedly in there music with unintelligible lyric lyric Satan unintelligible lyric continue what do you get audience Satan Satan OK at least we get Satan now I will prime the auditory part of you brain to tell you what you be suppose to hear and then hear it again music with lyric music end laughter applause you can not miss it when I tell you what be there laughter I be go to just end with a positive nice little story the skeptic be a nonprofit educational organization we be always look for little good thing that person do and in England there be a pop singer one of the top popular singer in England today Katie Melua and she write a beautiful song it be in the top five in 2005 call nine million bicycle in Beijing it be a love story she be sort of the Norah Jones of the UK about how she much love she guy and compare to nine million bicycle and so forth and she have this one passage here music lyric we be 12 billion light year from the edgeThat a guess no one can ever say it be true but I know that I will always be with you Michael Shermer well that be nice at least she get it close in America it would be we be 6 000 light year from the edge laughter but my friend Simon Singh the particle physicist now turn science educator who write the book the Big Bang and so on use every chance he get to promote good science and so he write a op ed piece in the Guardian about Katie song in which he say well we know exactly how far from the edge you know it be 13 7 billion light year and it be not a guess we know within precise error bar how close it be so we can say although not absolutely true it be pretty close to be true and to he credit Katie call he up after this op ed piece come out and say I be so embarrassed I be in the astronomy club I should have know good and she be cut the song so I will end with the new version music with lyric we be 13 7 billion light year from the edge of the observable universe that be a good estimate with well define error bar and with the available information I predict that I will always be with you laughter how cool be that applause
