about 10 year ago I take on the task to teach global development to Swedish undergraduate student that be after have spend about 20 year together with African institution study hunger in Africa so I be sort of expect to know a little about the world and I start in we medical university Karolinska Institute a undergraduate course call Global Health but when you get that opportunity you get a little nervous I think this student come to we actually have the high grade you can get in Swedish college system so I think maybe they know everything I be go to teach they about so I do a pre test when they come and one of the question from which I learn a lot be this one which country have the high child mortality of this five pair I put they together so that in each pair of country one have twice the child mortality of the other and this mean that it be much big a difference than the uncertainty of the datum I will not put you at a test here but it be Turkey which be high there Poland Russia Pakistan and South Africa and this be the result of the Swedish student I do it so I get the confidence interval which be pretty narrow and I get happy of course a 1 8 right answer out of five possible that mean that there be a place for a professor of international health and for my course laughter but one late night when I be compile the report I really realize my discovery I have show that Swedish top student know statistically significantly less about the world than the chimpanzee laughter because the chimpanzee would score half right if I give they two banana with Sri Lanka and Turkey they would be right half of the case but the student be not there the problem for I be not ignorance it be preconceived idea I do also a unethical study of the professor of the Karolinska Institute that hand out the Nobel Prize in Medicine and they be on par with the chimpanzee there laughter this be where I realize that there be really a need to communicate because the datum of what be happen in the world and the child health of every country be very well aware we do this software which display it like this every bubble here be a country this country over here be China this be India the size of the bubble be the population and on this axis here I put fertility rate because my student what they say when they look upon the world and I ask they what do you really think about the world well I first discover that the textbook be Tintin mainly laughter and they say the world be still we and they and we be western world and they be third World and what do you mean with western world I say well that be long life and small family and Third World be short life and large family so this be what I could display here I put fertility rate here number of child per woman one two three four up to about eight child per woman we have very good datum since 1962 1960 about on the size of family in all country the error margin be narrow here I put life expectancy at birth from 30 year in some country up to about 70 year and 1962 there be really a group of country here that be industrialize country and they have small family and long life and this be the develop country they have large family and they have relatively short life now what have happen since 1962 we want to see the change be the student right be it still two type of country or have this develop country get small family and they live here or have they get long live and live up there let see we stop the world then this be all u n statistics that have be available here we go can you see there it be China there move against good health there improve there all the green latin American country be move towards small family you yellow one here be the Arabic country and they get long life but not large family the African be the green here they still remain here this be India Indonesia be move on pretty fast laughter in the 80 here you have Bangladesh still among the African country but now Bangladesh it be a miracle that happen in the 80 the imam start to promote family planning they move up into that corner and in the 90 we have the terrible HIV epidemic that take down the life expectancy of the African country and all the rest of they move up into the corner where we have long life and small family and we have a completely new world applause applause end let I make a comparison directly between the United States of America and Vietnam 1964 America have small family and long life Vietnam have large family and short life and this be what happen the datum during the war indicate that even with all the death there be a improvement of life expectancy by the end of the year the family plan start in Vietnam they go for small family and the United States up there be get for long life keep family size and in the 80 now they give up communist planning and they go for market economy and it move fast even than social life and today we have in Vietnam the same life expectancy and the same family size here in Vietnam 2003 as in United States 1974 by the end of the war if we do not look in the datum I think we all underestimate the tremendous change in Asia which be in social change before we see the economical change let move over to another way here in which we could display the distribution in the world of the income this be the world distribution of income of person one dollar 10 dollar or 100 dollar per day there be no gap between rich and poor any long this be a myth there be a little hump here but there be person all the way and if we look where the income end up this be 100 percent the world annual income and the rich 20 percent they take out of that about 74 percent and the poor 20 percent they take about two percent and this show that the concept of develop country be extremely doubtful we think about aid like this person here give aid to this person here but in the middle we have most of the world population and they have now 24 percent of the income we hear it in other form and who be this where be the different country I can show you Africa this be Africa 10 the world population most in poverty this be OECD the rich country the country club of the U N and they be over here on this side quite a overlap between Africa and OECD and this be latin America it have everything on this Earth from the poor to the rich in Latin America and on top of that we can put East Europe we can put East Asia and we put South Asia and how do it look like if we go back in time to about 1970 then there be more of a hump and we have most who live in absolute poverty be Asian the problem in the world be the poverty in Asia and if I now let the world move forward you will see that while population increase there be hundred of million in Asia get out of poverty and some other get into poverty and this be the pattern we have today and the good projection from the World Bank be that this will happen and we will not have a divided world we will have most person in the middle of course it be a logarithmic scale here but we concept of economy be growth with percent we look upon it as a possibility of percentile increase if I change this and take gdp per capita instead of family income and I turn this individual datum into regional datum of gross domestic product and I take the region down here the size of the bubble be still the population and you have the OECD there and you have sub Saharan Africa there and we take off the Arab state there come both from Africa and from Asia and we put they separately and we can expand this axis and I can give it a new dimension here by add the social value there child survival now I have money on that axis and I have the possibility of child to survive there in some country 99 7 of child survive to five year of age other only 70 and here it seem there be a gap between OECD Latin America East Europe East Asia Arab state South Asia and sub Saharan Africa the linearity be very strong between child survival and money but let I split sub Saharan Africa Health be there and good health be up there I can go here and I can split sub Saharan Africa into its country and when it burst the size of its country bubble be the size of the population Sierra Leone down there Mauritius be up there Mauritius be the first country to get away with trade barrier and they could sell they sugar they could sell they textile on equal term as the person in Europe and North America there be a huge difference between Africa and Ghana be here in the middle in Sierra Leone humanitarian aid here in Uganda development aid here time to invest there you can go for a holiday it be a tremendous variation within Africa which we rarely often make that it be equal everything I can split South Asia here India the big bubble in the middle but a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka I can split Arab state how be they same climate same culture same religion huge difference even between neighbor Yemen civil war United Arab Emirates money which be quite equally and well use not as the myth be and that include all the child of the foreign worker who be in the country datum be often good than you think many person say datum be bad there be a uncertainty margin but we can see the difference here Cambodia Singapore the difference be much big than the weakness of the datum East Europe Soviet economy for a long time but they come out after 10 year very very differently and there be latin America today we do not have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country in Latin America Chile will have a low child mortality than Cuba within some few year from now here we have high income country in the OECD and we get the whole pattern here of the world which be more or less like this and if we look at it how the world look in 1960 it start to move this be Mao Tse tung he bring health to China and then he die and then Deng Xiaoping come and bring money to China and bring they into the mainstream again and we have see how country move in different direction like this so it be sort of difficult to get a example country which show the pattern of the world but I would like to bring you back to about here at 1960 I would like to compare South Korea which be this one with Brazil which be this one the label go away for I here and I would like to compare Uganda which be there and I can run it forward like this and you can see how South Korea be make a very very fast advancement whereas Brazil be much slow and if we move back again here and we put on trail on they like this you can see again that the speed of development be very very different and the country be move more or less in the same rate as money and health but it seem you can move much fast if you be healthy first than if you be wealthy first and to show that you can put on the way of United Arab Emirates they come from here a mineral country they cache all the oil they get all the money but health can not be buy at the supermarket you have to invest in health you have to get kid into schooling you have to train health staff you have to educate the population and Sheikh Zayed do that in a fairly good way in spite of fall oil price he bring this country up here so we have get a much more mainstream appearance of the world where all country tend to use they money good than they use in the past now this be more or less if you look at the average datum of the country they be like this now that be dangerous to use average datum because there be such a lot of difference within country so if I go and look here we can see that Uganda today be where South Korea be in 1960 if I split Uganda there be quite a difference within Uganda this be the quintile of Uganda the rich 20 percent of Ugandan be there the poor be down there if I split South Africa it be like this and if I go down and look at Niger where there be such a terrible famine lastly it be like this the 20 percent poor of Niger be out here and the 20 percent rich of South Africa be there and yet we tend to discuss on what solution there should be in Africa Everything in this world exist in Africa and you can not discuss universal access to HIV medicine for that quintile up here with the same strategy as down here the improvement of the world must be highly contextualized and it be not relevant to have it on regional level we must be much more detailed we find that student get very excited when they can use this and even more policy maker and the corporate sector would like to see how the world be change now why do not this take place why be we not use the datum we have we have datum in the United Nations in the national statistical agency and in university and other non governmental organization because the datum be hide down in the database and the public be there and the internet be there but we have still not use it effectively all that information we see change in the world do not include publicly fund statistics there be some web page like this you know but they take some nourishment down from the database but person put price on they stupid password and boring statistics laughter and this will not work applause so what be need we have the database it be not the new database you need we have wonderful design tool and more and more be add up here so we start a nonprofit venture which link datum to design we call Gapminder from the London Underground where they warn you mind the gap so we think Gapminder be appropriate and we start to write software which could link the datum like this and it be not that difficult it take some person year and we have produce animation you can take a data set and put it there we be liberate u n datum some few u n organization some country accept that they database can go out on the world but what we really need be of course a search function a search function where we can copy the datum up to a searchable format and get it out in the world and what do we hear when we go around I have do anthropology on the main statistical unit everyone say it be impossible this can not be do we information be so peculiar in detail so that can not be search as other can be search we can not give the datum free to the student free to the entrepreneur of the world but this be what we would like to see be not it the publicly fund datum be down here and we would like flower to grow out on the net and one of the crucial point be to make they searchable and then person can use the different design tool to animate it there and I have pretty good news for you I have good news that the present new Head of U N Statistics he do not say it be impossible he only say we can not do it laughter and that be a quite clever guy huh laughter so we can see a lot happen in datum in the come year we will be able to look at income distribution in completely new way this be the income distribution of China 1970 this be the income distribution of the United States 1970 almost no overlap and what have happen what have happen be this that China be grow it be not so equal any long and it be appear here overlook the United States almost like a ghost be not it laughter it be pretty scary laughter but I think it be very important to have all this information we need really to see it and instead of look at this I would like to end up by show the internet user per 1 000 in this software we access about 500 variable from all the country quite easily it take some time to change for this but on the axis you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have and the thing would be to get up the database free to get they searchable and with a second click to get they into the graphic format where you can instantly understand they now statistician do not like it because they say that this will not show the reality we have to have statistical analytical method but this be hypothesis generating I end now with the world there the internet be come the number of internet user be go up like this this be the gdp per capita and it be a new technology come in but then amazingly how well it fit to the economy of the country that be why the 100 computer will be so important but it be a nice tendency it be as if the world be flatten off be not it this country be lift more than the economy and will be very interesting to follow this over the year as I would like you to be able to do with all the publicly fund datum thank you very much applause
