I have be at MIT for 44 year I go to TED I there be only one other person here I think who do that all the other ted and I go to they all under Ricky regime I talk about what the Media Lab be do which today have almost 500 person in it and if you read the press last week it actually say I quit the Media Lab I do not quit the media lab I step down as chairman which be a kind of ridiculous title but someone else have take it on and one of the thing you can do as a professor be you stay on as a professor and I will now do for the rest of my life the one laptop per child which I have sort of be do for a year and a half anyway so I be go to tell you about this use my 18 minute to tell you why we be do it how we be do it and then what we be do and at some point I will even pass around what the 100 laptop might be like I be ask by Chris to talk about some of the big issue and so I figure I would start with the three that at least drive I to do this and the first be pretty obvious it be amazing when you meet a head of state and you say what be you most precious natural resource they will not say child at first and then when you say child they will pretty quickly agree with you and so that be not very hard laughter everybody agree that whatever the solution be to the big problem they include education sometimes can be just education and can never be without some element of education so that be certainly part of it and the third be a little bit less obvious and that be that we all in this room learn how to walk how to talk not by be teach how to talk or teach how to walk but by interact with the world by have certain result as a consequence of be able to ask for something or be able to stand up and reach it whereas at about the age six we be tell to stop learn that way and that all learn from then on would happen through teach whether it be person stand up like I be do now or a book or something but it be really through teaching and one of the thing in general that computer have provide to learning be that it now include a kind of learning which be a little bit more like walk and talk in the sense that a lot of it be drive by the learner himself or herself so with that as the principle some of you may know Seymour Papert this be back in 1982 when we be work in Senegal because some person think that the 100 laptop just happen a year ago or two year ago or we be strike by lightning this actually have go back a long time and in fact back to the 60 here we be in the 80 Steve Jobs have give we some laptop we be in Senegal it do not scale but it at least be bring computer to develop country and learn pretty quickly that this kid even though English be not they language the latin alphabet barely be they language but they could just swim like fish they could play this like piano a little bit more recently I get involve personally and this be two anecdote one be in Cambodia in a village that have no electricity no water no television no telephone but have broadband internet now and this kid they first English word be Google and they only know Skype they have never hear of telephony they just use Skype and they go home at night they have get a broadband connection in a hut that do not have electricity the parent love it because when they open up the laptop it be the bright light source in the house and talk about where metaphor and reality mix this be the actual school in parallel with this Seymour Papert get the governor of Maine to legislate one laptop per child in the year 2002 now at the time I think it be fair to say that 80 percent of the teacher be let I say apprehensive really they be actually against it and they really prefer that the money would be use for high salary more school whatever and now three and a half year later guess what they be report five thing drop of truancy to almost zero attend parent teacher meeting which nobody do and now almost everybody do drop in discipline problem increase in student participation teacher be now say it be kind of fun to teach kid be engage they have laptop and then the fifth which interest I the most be that the server have to be turn off at certain time at night because the teacher be get too much email from the kid ask they for help so when you see that kind of thing this be not something that you have to test the day of pilot project be over when person say we would like to do three or four thousand in we country to see how it work Screw you go to the back of the line and someone else will do it and then when you figure out that this work you can join as well and this be what we be do laughter applause so one laptop per child be form about a year and a half ago it be a nonprofit association it raise about 20 million dollar to do the engineering to just get this build and then have it produce afterwards Scale be truly important and it be not important because you can buy component at a low price ok it be because you can go to a manufacturer and I will leave the name out but we want a small display do not have to have perfect color uniformity it can even have a pixel or two miss it do not have to be that bright and this particular manufacturer say we be not interested in that we be interested in the living room we be interested in perfect color uniformity we be interested in big display bright display you be not part of we strategic plan and I say that be kind of too bad because we need 100 million unit a year laughter and they say oh well maybe we could become part of you strategic plan and that be why scale count and that be why we will not launch this without five to 10 million unit in the first run and the idea be to launch with enough scale that the scale itself help bring the price down and that be why I say seven to 10 million there and we be do it without a sale and marketing team I mean you be look at the sale and marketing team we will do it by go to seven large country and get they to agree and launch it and then the other can follow we have partner it be not hard to guess Google would be one the other be all play to pend and this have be in the press a great deal it be the so call Green Machine that we introduce with Kofi Annan in November at the World Summit that be hold in Tunisia now once person start look at this they say ah this be a laptop project well no it be not a laptop project it be a education project and the fun part and I be quite focused on it I tell person I use to be a light bulb but now I be a laser I be just go to get that thing build and it turn out it be not so hard because laptop economics be the follow I say 50 percent here it be more like 60 60 percent of the cost of you laptop be sale marketing distribution and profit now we have none of that ok none of that figure into we cost because first of all we sell it at cost and the government distribute it it get distribute to the school system like a textbook so that piece disappear then you have display and everything else now the display on you laptop cost in rough number 10 dollar a diagonal inch that can drop to eight it can drop to seven but it be not go to drop to two or to one and a half unless we do some pretty clever thing it be the rest that little brown box that be pretty fascinating because the rest of you laptop be devote to itself it be a little bit like a obese person have to use most of they energy to move they obesity laughter and we have a situation today which be incredible I have be use laptop since they inception and my laptop run slow less reliably and less pleasantly than it ever have before and this year be bad applause person clap sometimes you even get stand ovation and I say what the hell wrong with you why be we all sit there and somebody to remain nameless call we laptop a gadget recently and I say God we laptop be go to go like a bat out of hell when you open it up it be go to go bing it will be on it will be just like it be in 1985 when you buy a Apple Macintosh 512 it work really well and we have be go steadily downhill now person ask all the time what it be that be what it be the two piece that be probably notable it will be a mesh network so when the kid open up they laptop they all become a network and then just need one or two point of backhaul you can serve a couple of thousand kid with two megabit so you really can bring into a village and then the village can connect themselves and you really can do it quite well the dual mode display the idea be to have a display that both work outdoors be not it fun use you cell phone outdoors in the sunlight well you can not see it and one of the reason you can not see it be because it be backlight most of the time most cell phone now what we be do be we be do one that will be both frontlit and backlit and whether you manually switch it or you do it in the software be to be see but when it be backlit it be color and when it be frontlit it be black and white at three time the resolution be it all work out no that be why a lot of we person be more or less live in Taiwan right now and in about 30 day we will know for sure whether this work probably the most important piece there be that the kid really can do the maintenance and this be again something that person do not believe but I really think it be quite true that be the machine we show in Tunis this be more the direction that we be go to go and it be something that we do not think be possible now I be go to pass this around this be not a design ok so this be just a mechanical engineering sort of embodiment of it for you to play with and it be clearly just a model the work one be at MIT I be go to pass it to this handsome gentleman at least you can decide whether it go left or Chris Anderson before you do it for the person down in simulcast Nicholas Negroponte sorry I forget CA just show it off a bit so wherever the camera be ok good point thank you Chris the idea be that it would be not only a laptop but that it could transform into a electronic book so it be sort of a electronic book this be where when you go outside it be in black and white the game button be miss but it will also be a game machine book machine set it up this way and it be a television set etc etc be that enough for simulcast ok sorry I will let Jim decide which way to send it afterwards ok seven country laughter I say maybe for Massachusetts because they actually have to do a bid by law you have get to bid and so on and so forth so I can not quite name they in the other case they do not have to do bid they can decide it be the federal government in each case it be kind of agonizing because a lot of person say let do it at the state level because state be more nimble than the feds just because of size and yet we count we be really deal with the federal government we be really deal with ministry of education and if you look at government around the world ministry of education tend to be the most conservative and also the one that have huge payroll everybody think they know about education a lot of culture be build into it as well it be really hard and so it be certainly the hard road if you look at the country they be pretty geoculturally distribute have they all agree no not completely probably Thailand Brazil and Nigeria be the three that be the most active and most agree we be purposely not sign anything with anybody until we actually have the work one and since I visit each one of that country within at least every three month I be just go around the world every three week here be sort of the schedule and I put at the bottom we might give some away free in two year at this meeting everybody say it be a 100 laptop you can not do it well guess what we be not we be come in probably at 135 to start then drift down and that be very important because so many thing hit the market at a price and then drift up it be kind of the loss leader and then as soon as it look interesting it can not be afford or it can not be scale out so we be target 50 dollar in 2010 the gray market a big issue and one of the way just one but one of the way to help in the case of the gray market be to make something that be so utterly unique it be a little bit like the fact that automobile thousand of automobile be steal every day in the United States not one single post office truck be steal laughter and why because there be no market for post office truck it look like a post office truck you can spray paint it you can do anything you want I just learn recently in South Africa no white Volvos be steal period none zero so we want to make it very much like a white Volvo each government have a task force this perhaps be less interesting but we be try to get the government to all work together and it be not easy the economics of this be to start with the federal government and then later to subsequently go to other whether it be child to child funding so a child in this country buy one for a child in the develop world maybe of the same gender maybe of the same age a uncle give a niece or a nephew that as a birthday present I mean there be all sort of thing that will happen and they will be very very exciting and everybody say I say it be a education project be we provide the software the answer be the system certainly have software but no we be not provide the education content that be really do in the country but we be certainly constructionist and we certainly believe in learning by do and everything from Logo which be start in 1968 to more modern thing like scratch if you have ever even hear of it be very very much part of it and that be the rollout be we dream be this real it actually be real the only criticism and person really do not want to criticize this because it be a humanitarian effort a nonprofit effort and to criticize it be a little bit stupid actually laughter but the one thing that person could criticize be great idea but this guy can not do it and that could either mean this guy professor and so on could not do it or that it be not possible well on December 12 a company call Quanta agree to build it and since they make about one third of all the laptop on the planet today that question disappear so it be not a matter of whether it be go to happen it be go to happen and if it come out at 138 dollar so what if it come out six month late so what that be a pretty soft landing thank you applause
