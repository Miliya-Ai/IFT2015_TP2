as other speaker have say it be a rather daunting experience a particularly daunting experience to be speak in front of this audience but unlike the other speaker I be not go to tell you about the mystery of the universe or the wonder of evolution or the really clever innovative way person be attack the major inequality in we world or even the challenge of nation state in the modern global economy my brief as you have just hear be to tell you about statistics and to be more precise to tell you some exciting thing about statistics and that be laughter that be rather more challenging than all the speaker before I and all the one come after I laughter one of my senior colleague tell I when I be a youngster in this profession rather proudly that statistician be person who like figure but do not have the personality skill to become accountant laughter and there be another in joke among statistician and that be how do you tell the introverted statistician from the extroverted statistician to which the answer be the extroverted statistician the one who look at the other person shoe laughter but I want to tell you something useful and here it be so concentrate now this evening there be a reception in the University Museum of Natural History and it be a wonderful setting as I hope you will find and a great icon to the good of the Victorian tradition it be very unlikely in this special setting and this collection of person but you might just find yourself talk to someone you would rather wish that you be not so here be what you do when they say to you what do you do you say I be a statistician laughter well except they have be pre warn now and they will know you be make it up and then one of two thing will happen they will either discover they long lose cousin in the other corner of the room and run over and talk to they or they will suddenly become parched and or hungry and often both and sprint off for a drink and some food and you will be leave in peace to talk to the person you really want to talk to it be one of the challenge in we profession to try and explain what we do we be not top on person list for dinner party guest and conversation and so on and it be something I have never really find a good way of do but my wife who be then my girlfriend manage it much good than I have ever be able to many year ago when we first start go out she be work for the BBC in Britain and I be at that stage work in America I be come back to visit she she tell this to one of she colleague who say well what do you boyfriend do Sarah think quite hard about the thing I have explain and she concentrate in that day on listen laughter do not tell she I say that and she be think about the work I do develop mathematical model for understand evolution and modern genetics so when she colleague say what do he do she pause and say he model thing laughter well she colleague suddenly get much more interested than I have any right to expect and go on and say what do he model well Sarah think a little bit more about my work and say gene laughter he model gene that be my first love and that be what I will tell you a little bit about what I want to do more generally be to get you think about the place of uncertainty and randomness and chance in we world and how we react to that and how well we do or do not think about it so you have have a pretty easy time up till now a few laugh and all that kind of thing in the talk to date you have get to think and I be go to ask you some question so here be the scene for the first question I be go to ask you can you imagine toss a coin successively and for some reason which shall remain rather vague we be interested in a particular pattern here be one a head follow by a tail follow by a tail so suppose we toss a coin repeatedly then the pattern head tail tail that we have suddenly become fixate with happen here and you can count one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 it happen after the 10th toss so you might think there be more interesting thing to do but humor I for the moment imagine this half of the audience each get out coin and they toss they until they first see the pattern head tail tail the first time they do it maybe it happen after the 10th toss as here the second time maybe it be after the fourth toss the next time after the 15th toss so you do that lot and lot of time and you average that number that be what I want this side to think about the other half of the audience do not like head tail tail they think for deep cultural reason that be boring and they be much more interested in a different pattern head tail head so on this side you get out you coin and you toss and toss and toss and you count the number of time until the pattern head tail head appear and you average they ok so on this side you have get a number you have do it lot of time so you get it accurately which be the average number of toss until head tail tail on this side you have get a number the average number of toss until head tail head so here be a deep mathematical fact if you have get two number one of three thing must be true either they be the same or this one big than this one or this one big than that one so what be go on here so you have all get to think about this and you have all get to vote and we be not move on and I do not want to end up in the two minute silence to give you more time to think about it until everyone express a view ok so what you want to do be compare the average number of toss until we first see head tail head with the average number of toss until we first see head tail tail who think that a be true that on average it will take long to see head tail head than head tail tail who think that b be true that on average they be the same who think that c be true that on average it will take less time to see head tail head than head tail tail ok who have not vote yet because that be really naughty I say you have to laughter ok so most person think b be true and you might be relieve to know even rather distinguished mathematician think that it be not a be true here it take long on average in fact the average number of toss till head tail head be 10 and the average number of toss until head tail tail be eight how could that be anything different about the two pattern there be Head tail head overlap itself if you go head tail head tail head you can cunningly get two occurrence of the pattern in only five toss you can not do that with head tail tail that turn out to be important there be two way of think about this I will give you one of they so imagine let suppose we be do it on this side remember you be excited about head tail tail you be excited about head tail head we start toss a coin and we get a head and you start sit on the edge of you seat because something great and wonderful or awesome might be about to happen the next toss be a tail you get really excited the champagne on ice just next to you you have get the glass chilled to celebrate you be wait with bated breath for the final toss and if it come down a head that be great you be do and you celebrate if it be a tail well rather disappointedly you put the glass away and put the champagne back and you keep toss to wait for the next head to get excited on this side there be a different experience it be the same for the first two part of the sequence you be a little bit excited with the first head you get rather more excited with the next tail then you toss the coin if it be a tail you crack open the champagne if it be a head you be disappointed but you be still a third of the way to you pattern again and that be a informal way of present it that be why there be a difference another way of think about it if we toss a coin eight million time then we would expect a million head tail head and a million head tail tail but the head tail head could occur in clump so if you want to put a million thing down amongst eight million position and you can have some of they overlap the clump will be far apart it be another way of get the intuition what be the point I want to make it be a very very simple example a easily state question in probability which every you be in good company everybody get wrong this be my little diversion into my real passion which be genetics there be a connection between head tail head and head tail tail in genetics and it be the follow when you toss a coin you get a sequence of head and tail when you look at dna there be a sequence of not two thing head and tail but four letter as g c and t and there be little chemical scissors call restriction enzyme which cut dna whenever they see particular pattern and they be a enormously useful tool in modern molecular biology and instead of ask the question how long until I see a head tail head you can ask how big will the chunk be when I use a restriction enzyme which cut whenever it see G A A G for example how long will that chunk be that be a rather trivial connection between probability and genetics there be a much deep connection which I do not have time to go into and that be that modern genetics be a really exciting area of science and we will hear some talk later in the conference specifically about that but it turn out that unlock the secret in the information generate by modern experimental technology a key part of that have to do with fairly sophisticated you will be relieve to know that I do something useful in my day job rather more sophisticated than the head tail head story but quite sophisticated computer modeling and mathematical modeling and modern statistical technique and I will give you two little snippet two example of project we be involve in in my group in Oxford both of which I think be rather exciting you know about the Human Genome Project that be a project which aim to read one copy of the human genome the natural thing to do after you have do that and that be what this project the International HapMap Project which be a collaboration between lab in five or six different country think of the Human Genome Project as learn what we have get in common and the HapMap Project be try to understand where there be difference between different person why do we care about that well there be lot of reason the most pressing one be that we want to understand how some difference make some person susceptible to one disease type 2 diabetes for example and other difference make person more susceptible to heart disease or stroke or autism and so on that be one big project there be a second big project recently fund by the Wellcome Trust in this country involve very large study thousand of individual with each of eight different disease common disease like type 1 and type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease bipolar disease and so on to try and understand the genetics to try and understand what it be about genetic difference that cause the disease why do we want to do that because we understand very little about most human disease we do not know what cause they and if we can get in at the bottom and understand the genetics we will have a window on the way the disease work and a whole new way about think about disease therapy and preventative treatment and so on so that be as I say the little diversion on my main love back to some of the more mundane issue of think about uncertainty here be another quiz for you now suppose we have get a test for a disease which be not infallible but it be pretty good it get it right 99 percent of the time and I take one of you or I take someone off the street and I test they for the disease in question let suppose there be a test for HIV the virus that cause AIDS and the test say the person have the disease what be the chance that they do the test get it right 99 percent of the time so a natural answer be 99 percent who like that answer come on everyone be get to get involved do not think you do not trust I anymore laughter well you be right to be a bit skeptical because that be not the answer that be what you might think it be not the answer and it be not because it be only part of the story it actually depend on how common or how rare the disease be so let I try and illustrate that here be a little caricature of a million individual so let think about a disease that affect it be pretty rare it affect one person in 10 000 amongst this million individual most of they be healthy and some of they will have the disease and in fact if this be the prevalence of the disease about 100 will have the disease and the rest will not so now suppose we test they all what happen well amongst the 100 who do have the disease the test will get it right 99 percent of the time and 99 will test positive Amongst all this other person who do not have the disease the test will get it right 99 percent of the time it will only get it wrong one percent of the time but there be so many of they that there will be a enormous number of false positive put that another way of all of they who test positive so here they be the individual involve less than one in 100 actually have the disease so even though we think the test be accurate the important part of the story be there be another bit of information we need here be the key intuition what we have to do once we know the test be positive be to weigh up the plausibility or the likelihood of two compete explanation each of that explanation have a likely bit and a unlikely bit one explanation be that the person do not have the disease that be overwhelmingly likely if you pick someone at random but the test get it wrong which be unlikely the other explanation be that the person do have the disease that be unlikely but the test get it right which be likely and the number we end up with that number which be a little bit less than one in 100 be to do with how likely one of that explanation be relative to the other each of they take together be unlikely here be a more topical example of exactly the same thing that of you in Britain will know about what be become rather a celebrated case of a woman call Sally Clark who have two baby who die suddenly and initially it be think that they die of what be know informally as cot death and more formally as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome for various reason she be later charge with murder and at the trial she trial a very distinguished pediatrician give evidence that the chance of two cot death innocent death in a family like hers which be professional and non smoking be one in 73 million to cut a long story short she be convict at the time late and fairly recently acquit on appeal in fact on the second appeal and just to set it in context you can imagine how awful it be for someone to have lose one child and then two if they be innocent to be convict of murder they to be put through the stress of the trial convict of murder they and to spend time in a woman prison where all the other prisoner think you kill you child be a really awful thing to happen to someone and it happen in large part here because the expert get the statistics horribly wrong in two different way so where do he get the one in 73 million number he look at some research which say the chance of one cot death in a family like Sally Clark be about one in 8 500 so he say I will assume that if you have one cot death in a family the chance of a second child die from cot death be not change so that be what statistician would call a assumption of independence it be like say if you toss a coin and get a head the first time that will not affect the chance of get a head the second time so if you toss a coin twice the chance of get a head twice be a half that be the chance the first time time a half the chance a second time so he say here I will assume that this event be independent when you multiply 8 500 together twice you get about 73 million and none of this be state to the court as a assumption or present to the jury that way unfortunately here and really regrettably first of all in a situation like this you would have to verify it empirically and secondly it be palpably false there be lot and lot of thing that we do not know about sudden infant death it might well be that there be environmental factor that we be not aware of and it be pretty likely to be the case that there be genetic factor we be not aware of so if a family suffer from one cot death you would put they in a high risk group they have probably get this environmental risk factor and or genetic risk factor we do not know about and to argue then that the chance of a second death be as if you do not know that information be really silly it be bad than silly it be really bad science nonetheless that be how it be present and at trial nobody even argue it that be the first problem the second problem be what do the number of one in 73 million mean so after Sally Clark be convict you can imagine it make rather a splash in the press one of the journalist from one of Britain more reputable newspaper write that what the expert have say be the chance that she be innocent be one in 73 million now that be a logical error it be exactly the same logical error as the logical error of think that after the disease test which be 99 percent accurate the chance of have the disease be 99 percent in the disease example we have to bear in mind two thing one of which be the possibility that the test get it right or not and the other one be the chance a priori that the person have the disease or not it be exactly the same in this context there be two thing involve two part to the explanation we want to know how likely or relatively how likely two different explanation be one of they be that Sally Clark be innocent which be a priori overwhelmingly likely most mother do not kill they child and the second part of the explanation be that she suffer a incredibly unlikely event not as unlikely as one in 73 million but nonetheless rather unlikely the other explanation be that she be guilty now we probably think a priori that be unlikely and we certainly should think in the context of a criminal trial that that be unlikely because of the presumption of innocence and then if she be try to kill the child she succeed so the chance that she be innocent be not one in 73 million we do not know what it be it have to do with weigh up the strength of the other evidence against she and the statistical evidence we know the child die what matter be how likely or unlikely relative to each other the two explanation be and they be both implausible there be a situation where error in statistics have really profound and really unfortunate consequence in fact there be two other woman who be convict on the basis of the evidence of this pediatrician who have subsequently be release on appeal many case be review and it be particularly topical because he be currently face a disrepute charge at Britain General Medical Council so just to conclude what be the take home message from this well we know that randomness and uncertainty and chance be very much a part of we everyday life it be also true and although you as a collective be very special in many way you be completely typical in not get the example I give right it be very well document that person get thing wrong they make error of logic in reasoning with uncertainty we can cope with the subtlety of language brilliantly and there be interesting evolutionary question about how we get here we be not good at reasoning with uncertainty that be a issue in we everyday life as you have hear from many of the talk statistics underpin a enormous amount of research in science in social science in medicine and indeed quite a lot of industry all of quality control which have have a major impact on industrial processing be underpin by statistics it be something we be bad at do at the very least we should recognize that and we tend not to to go back to the legal context at the Sally Clark trial all of the lawyer just accept what the expert say so if a pediatrician have come out and say to a jury I know how to build bridge I have build one down the road please drive you car home over it they would have say well pediatrician do not know how to build bridge that be what engineer do on the other hand he come out and effectively say or imply I know how to reason with uncertainty I know how to do statistics and everyone say well that be fine he be a expert so we need to understand where we competence be and be not exactly the same kind of issue arise in the early day of dna profiling when scientist and lawyer and in some case judge routinely misrepresent evidence usually one hope innocently but misrepresent evidence forensic scientist say the chance that this guy innocent be one in three million even if you believe the number just like the 73 million to one that be not what it mean and there have be celebrate appeal case in Britain and elsewhere because of that and just to finish in the context of the legal system it be all very well to say let do we good to present the evidence but more and more in case of dna profiling this be another one we expect jury who be ordinary person and it be document they be very bad at this we expect jury to be able to cope with the sort of reasoning that go on in other sphere of life if person argue well except possibly for politics but in other sphere of life if person argue illogically we would say that be not a good thing we sort of expect it of politician and do not hope for much more in the case of uncertainty we get it wrong all the time and at the very least we should be aware of that and ideally we might try and do something about it thanks very much
