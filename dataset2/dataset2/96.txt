scary enough so Al I actually think I be rather good at brand so I have try to figure out a good design process to come up with a new term to replace global warming so we start with Babel Fish we put in global warming and then we decide that we have change it from English to Dutch into Het globale Verwarmen from Dutch to Korean into Hordahordaneecheewa laughter Korean to Portuguese aquecer se

a little bit too big it be burst at the seam here a little bit so we try to come up with a program how we could remake this structure to well accommodate TED so first of all we decide laughter that we need about one third bookstore one third Google cafe about 20 percent registration 80 percent luxury hotel about five percent for restroom and then of course we want to have the simulcast lounge the lobby and the Steinbeck forum now let I show you how that literally translate into the design program so first one of the problem with Monterey be that if there be global warming and Greenland melt as
