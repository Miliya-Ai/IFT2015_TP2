what I be go to show you first as quickly as I can be some foundational work some new technology that we bring to Microsoft as part of a acquisition almost exactly a year ago this be Seadragon and it be a environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amount of visual datum we be look at many many gigabyte of digital photo here and kind of seamlessly and continuously zoom in pan through it rearrange it in any way we want and it do not matter how much information we be look at how big this collection be or how big the image be most of they be ordinary digital camera photo but this one for example be a scan from the Library of Congress and it be in the 300 megapixel range it do not make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one be the number of pixel on you screen at any given moment it be also very flexible architecture this be a entire book so this be a example of non image datum this be Bleak House by Dickens every column be a chapter to prove to you that it be really text and not a image we can do something like so to really show that this be a real representation of the text it be not a picture maybe this be a artificial way to read a e book I would not recommend it this be a more realistic case a issue of the Guardian Every large image be the beginning of a section and this really give you the joy and the good experience of read the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper which be a inherently multi scale kind of medium we have do something with the corner of this particular issue of the Guardian we have make up a fake ad that be very high resolution much high than in a ordinary ad and we have embed extra content if you want to see the feature of this car you can see it here or other model or even technical specification and this really get at some of this idea about really do away with that limit on screen real estate we hope that this mean no more pop up and other rubbish like that should not be necessary of course mapping be one of that obvious application for a technology like this and this one I really will not spend any time on except to say that we have thing to contribute to this field as well but that be all the road in the U S superimpose on top of a NASA geospatial image so let pull up now something else this be actually live on the web now you can go check it out this be a project call Photosynth which marry two different technology one of they be Seadragon and the other be some very beautiful computer vision research do by Noah Snavely a graduate student at the University of Washington co advise by Steve Seitz at U W and Rick Szeliski at Microsoft Research A very nice collaboration and so this be live on the web it be power by Seadragon you can see that when we do this sort of view where we can dive through image and have this kind of multi resolution experience but the spatial arrangement of the image here be actually meaningful the computer vision algorithm have register this image together so that they correspond to the real space in which this shot all take near Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies all this shot be take so you see element here of stabilize slide show or panoramic imaging and this thing have all be relate spatially I be not sure if I have time to show you any other environment some be much more spatial I would like to jump straight to one of Noah original datum set this be from a early prototype that we first get work this summer to show you what I think be really the punch line behind the Photosynth technology it be not necessarily so apparent from look at the environment we have put up on the website we have to worry about the lawyer and so on this be a reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral that be do entirely computationally from image scrape from Flickr you just type Notre Dame into Flickr and you get some picture of guy in t shirt and of the campus and so on and each of this orange cone represent a image that be discover to belong to this model and so this be all Flickr image and they have all be relate spatially in this way we can just navigate in this very simple way applause applause end you know I never think that I would end up work at Microsoft it be very gratifying to have this kind of reception here laughter I guess you can see this be lot of different type of camera it be everything from cell phone camera to professional slr quite a large number of they stitch together in this environment if I can find some of the sort of weird one so many of they be occlude by face and so on somewhere in here there be actually a series of photograph here we go this be actually a poster of Notre Dame that register correctly we can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment what the point here really be be that we can do thing with the social environment this be now take datum from everybody from the entire collective memory visually of what the Earth look like and link all of that together that photo become link and they make something emergent that be great than the sum of the part you have a model that emerge of the entire Earth think of this as the long tail to Stephen Lawler virtual earth work and this be something that grow in complexity as person use it and whose benefit become great to the user as they use it they own photo be get tag with meta datum that somebody else enter if somebody bother to tag all of this saint and say who they all be then my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral suddenly get enrich with all of that datum and I can use it as a entry point to dive into that space into that meta verse use everybody else photo and do a kind of a cross modal and cross user social experience that way and of course a by product of all of that be immensely rich virtual model of every interesting part of the Earth collect not just from overhead flight and from satellite image and so on but from the collective memory thank you so much applause applause end Chris Anderson do I understand this right what you software be go to allow be that at some point really within the next few year all the picture that be share by anyone across the world be go to link together BAA Yes what this be really do be discover create hyperlink if you will between image it be do that base on the content inside the image and that get really exciting when you think about the richness of the semantic information a lot of image have like when you do a web search for image you type in phrase and the text on the web page be carry a lot of information about what that picture be of what if that picture link to all of you picture the amount of semantic interconnection and richness that come out of that be really huge it be a classic network effect ca truly incredible congratulation
