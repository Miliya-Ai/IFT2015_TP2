I be a visual artist and I be also one of the co founder of the Plastic Pollution Coalition I have be work with plastic bag which I cut up and sew back together as my primary material for my artwork for the last 20 year I turn they into two and three dimensional piece and sculpture and installation upon work with the plastic after about the first eight year some of my work start to fissure and break down into small little bit of plastic and I think great it be ephemeral just like we upon educate myself a little further about plastic I actually realize this be a bad thing it be a bad thing that plastic break down into small little bit because it be always still plastic and what we be find be that a lot of it be in the marine environment I then in the last few year learn about the Pacific garbage patch and the gyre and my initial reaction and I think this be a lot of person first reaction to learn about it be oh my God we have get to go out there and clean this thing up so I actually develop a proposal to go out with a cargo ship and two decommission fishing trawler a crane a chip machine and a cold molding machine and my intention be to go out to the gyre raise awareness about this issue and begin to pick up the plastic chip it into little bit and cold mold it into brick that could potentially be use as building material in underdeveloped community I begin talk with person who actually have be out to the gyre and be study the plastic problem in the marine environment and upon do so I realize actually that clean it up would be a very small drop in the bucket relative to how much be be generate every day around the world and that actually I need to back up and look at the big picture and the big picture be we need to find a way to turn off the faucet we need to cut the spigot of single use and disposable plastic which be enter the marine environment every day on a global scale so in look at that I also realize that I be really angry I be not just concerned about plastic that you be try to imagine out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean of which I have learn there be now 11 gyre potentially of plastic in five major ocean in the world it be not just that gyre of plastic that I be concerned about it be the gyre of plastic in the supermarket I would go to the supermarket and all of my food be package in plastic all of my beverage be package in plastic even at the health food market I be also concern about the plastic in the refrigerator and I be concerned about the plastic and the toxin that leach from plastic into we and into we body so I come together with a group of other person who be all look at this issue and we create the Plastic Pollution Coalition we have many initiative that we be work on but some of they be very basic one be if 80 to 90 percent of what we be find in the ocean of the marine debris that we be find in the ocean be plastic then why do not we call it what it be it be plastic pollution recycling everybody kind of end they book about be sustainable and greening with the idea of recycle you put something in a bin and you do not have to think about it again what be the reality of that in the United States less than seven percent of we plastic be recycle and if you really look into it particularly when it come to plastic bottle most of it be only down cycle or incinerate or ship to China it be down cycle and turn into less thing while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again or can be use again a plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again so this be a big issue for we another thing that we be look at and ask person to think about be we have add a fourth r onto the front of the Reduce Reuse recycle three r and that be refuse whenever possible refuse single use and disposable plastic Alternatives exist some of they be very old school I myself be now collect this cool pyrex container and use that instead of glad and Tupperware container to store food in and I know that I be do a service to myself and my family it be very easy to pick up a stainless steel bottle or a glass bottle if you be travel and you have forget to bring you stainless steel bottle and fill that up with water or filter water versus purchase plastic bottled water I guess what I want to say to everybody here and I know that you guy know a lot about this issue be that this be a huge problem in the ocean but this be a problem that we have create as consumer and we can solve we can solve this by raise awareness of the issue and teach person to choose alternative so whenever possible to choose alternative to single use plastic we can cut the stem tide the stem of this into we ocean and in do so save we ocean save we planet save ourselves thank you applause
