want to forget they when old age destroy my brain cell I want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the Olympics passion so here be a tale of passion the year be 1998 the place be a prison camp for tutsi refugee in Congo by the way 80 percent of all refugee and displace person in the world be woman and girl we can call this place in Congo a death camp because that who be not kill will die of disease or starvation the protagonist of this story be a young woman Rose Mapendo and she child she be pregnant and a widow soldier have force she to watch as she husband be torture and kill somehow

strong and passionate woman like Rose Mapendo I do not make they up there be no need for that I look around and I see they everywhere I have work with woman and for woman all my life I know they well I be bear in ancient time at the end of the world in a patriarchal catholic and conservative family no wonder that by age five I be a rage feminist although the term have not reach Chile yet so nobody know what the heck be wrong with I laughter I would soon find out that there be a high price to pay for my freedom and for question the patriarchy but I be happy to pay it because for every blow that I receive I be able to deliver two laughter once when my daughter Paula be in she twenty she say to I that feminism be date that I should move on we have a memorable fight feminism be date yes for privileged woman like my daughter and all of we here today but not for most of we sister in the rest of the world who be still force into premature marriage prostitution force labor they have child that they do not want or they can not feed they have no control over they body or they life they have no education and no freedom they be rape beat up and sometimes kill with impunity for most western young woman of today be call a feminist be a insult feminism have never be sexy but let I assure you that it never stop I from flirt and I have seldom suffer from lack of man laughter feminism be not dead by no means it have evolve if you do not like the term change it for Goddess sake call it Aphrodite or Venus or bimbo or whatever you want the name do not matter as long as we understand what it be about and we support it so here be another tale of passion and this be a sad one the place be a small woman clinic in a village in Bangladesh the year be 2005 Jenny be a young American dental hygienist who have go to the clinic as a volunteer during she three week vacation she be prepare to clean tooth but when she get there she find out that there be no doctor no dentist and the clinic be just a hut full of fly outside there be a line of woman who have wait several hour to be treat the first patient be in excruciating pain because she have several rotten molar Jenny realize that the only solution be to pull out the bad tooth she be not license for that she have never do it she risk a lot and she be terrified she do not even have the proper instrument but fortunately she have bring some Novocaine Jenny have a brave and passionate heart she murmur a prayer and she go ahead with the operation at the end the relieved patient kiss she hand that day the hygienist pull out many more tooth the next morning when she come again to the so call clinic she first patient be wait for she with she husband the woman face look like a watermelon it be so swollen that you can not even see the eye the husband furious threaten to kill the American Jenny be horrify at what she have do but then the translator explain that the patient condition have nothing to do with the operation the day before she husband beat she up because she be not home in time to prepare dinner for he million of woman live like this today they be the poor of the poor although woman do two third of the world labor they own less than one percent of the world asset they be pay less than man for the same work if they be pay at all and they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence and they be constantly threaten by exploitation violence and abuse it be a fact that give woman education work the ability to control they own income inherit and own property benefit the society if a woman be empower she child and she family will be good off if family prosper the village prosper and eventually so do the whole country Wangari Maathai go to a village in Kenya she talk with the woman and explain that the land be barren because they have cut and sell the tree she get the woman to plant new tree and water they drop by drop in a matter of five or six year they have a forest the soil be enrich and the village be save the poor and most backward society be always that that put woman down yet this obvious truth be ignore by government and also by philanthropy for every dollar give to a woman program 20 dollar be give to man program woman be 51 percent of humankind empower they will change everything more than technology and design and entertainment I can promise you that woman work together link informed and educate can bring peace and prosperity to this forsake planet in any war today most of the casualty be civilian mainly woman and child they be collateral damage man run the world and look at the mess we have what kind of world do we want this be a fundamental question that most of we be ask do it make sense to participate in the existing world order we want a world where life be preserve and the quality of life be enrich for everybody not only for the privileged in January I see a exhibit of Fernando Botero painting at the UC Berkeley library no museum or gallery in the United States except for the New York gallery that carry Botero work have dare to show the painting because the theme be the Abu Ghraib prison they be huge painting of torture and abuse of power in the voluminous Botero style I have not be able to get that image out of my mind or my heart what I fear most be power with impunity I fear abuse of power and the power to abuse in we species the alpha male define reality and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality and follow the rule the rule change all the time but they always benefit they and in this case the trickle down effect which do not work in economics work perfectly abuse trickle down from the top of the ladder to the bottom woman and child especially the poor be at the bottom even the most destitute of man have someone they can abuse a woman or a child I be feed up with the power that a few exert over the many through gender income race and class I think that the time be ripe to make fundamental change in we civilization but for real change we need feminine energy in the management of the world we need a critical number of woman in position of power and we need to nurture the feminine energy in man I be talk about man with young mind of course Old guy be hopeless we have to wait for they to die off laughter yes I would love to have Sophia Loren long leg and legendary breast but give a choice I would rather have the warrior heart of Wangari Maathai Somaly Mam Jenny and Rose Mapendo I want to make this world good not good but to make it good why not it be possible look around in this room all this knowledge energy talent and technology let get off we fanny roll up we sleeve and get to work passionately in create a almost perfect world thank you
