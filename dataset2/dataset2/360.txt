of the five sen vision be the one that I appreciate the most and it be the one that I can least take for grant I think this be partially due to my father who be blind it be a fact that he do not make much of a fuss about usually one time in Nova Scotia when we go to see a total eclipse of the sun laughter yeah same one as in the Carly Simon song which may or may not refer to James Taylor Warren Beatty or Mick Jagger we be not really sure they hand out this dark plastic viewer that allow we to look directly at the sun without damage we eye but Dad get really scared he do not want we do that he want we instead to use this cheap cardboard viewer so that there be no chance at all that we eye would be damage I think this be a little strange at the time what I do not know at the time be that my father have actually be bear with perfect eyesight when he and he sister Martha be just very little they mom take they out to see a total eclipse or actually a solar eclipse and not long after that both of they start lose they eyesight decade later it turn out that the source of they blindness be most likely some sort of bacterial infection as near as we can tell it have nothing whatsoever to do with that solar eclipse but by then my grandmother have already go to she grave think it be she fault so Dad graduate Harvard in 1946 marry my mom and buy a house in Lexington Massachusetts where the first shot be fire against the British in 1775 although we do not actually hit any of they until Concord he get a job work for Raytheon design guidance system which be part of the Route 128 high tech axis in that day so the equivalent of Silicon Valley in the 70 Dad be not a real militaristic kind of guy he just feel bad that he be not able to fight in World War II on account of he handicap although they do let he get through the several hour long army physical exam before they get to the very last test which be for vision laughter so Dad start rack up all of this patent and gain a reputation as a blind genius rocket scientist inventor but to we he be just Dad and we home life be pretty normal as a kid I watch a lot of television and have lot of nerdy hobby like mineralogy and microbiology and the space program and a little bit of politics I play a lot of chess but at the age of 14 a friend get I interested in comic book and I decide that be what I want to do for a live so here be my dad he be a scientist he be a engineer and he be a military contractor so he have four kid right one grow up to become a computer scientist one grow up to join the Navy one grow up to become a engineer and then there be I the comic book artist laughter which incidentally make I the opposite of Dean Kamen because I be a comic book artist son of a inventor and he be a inventor son of a comic book artist laughter right it be true applause the funny thing be Dad have a lot of faith in I he have faith in my ability as a cartoonist even though he have no direct evidence that I be any good whatsoever everything he see be just a blur now this give a real meaning to the term blind faith which do not have the same negative connotation for I that it do for other person now faith in thing which can not be see which can not be prove be not the sort of faith that I have ever really relate to all that much I tend to like science where what we see and can ascertain be the foundation of what we know but there be a middle ground too a middle ground tread by person like poor old Charles Babbage and he steam drive computer that be never build nobody really understand what it be that he have in mind except for Ada Lovelace and he go to he grave try to pursue that dream Vannevar Bush with he memex this idea of all of human knowledge at you fingertip he have this vision and I think a lot of person in he day probably think he be a bit of a kook and yeah we can look back in retrospect and say yeah ha ha it be all microfilm laughter but that be not the point he understand the shape of the future so do j c r licklider and he notion for computer human interaction same thing he understand the shape of the future even though it be something that would only be implement by person much later or Paul Baran and he vision for packet switch hardly anybody listen to he in he day or even the person who actually pull it off the person at Bolt Beranek and Newman in Boston who just would sketch out this structure of what would eventually become a worldwide network and sketch thing on the back of napkin and on note paper and argue over dinner at Howard Johnson on Route 128 in Lexington Massachusetts just two mile from where I be study the Queen Gambit Deferred and listen to Gladys Knight the Pips sing Midnight Train to Georgia laughter in my dad big easy chair you know so three type of vision right vision base on what one can not see the vision of that unseen and unknowable the vision of that which have already be prove or can be ascertain and this third kind a vision of something which can be which may be base on knowledge but be as yet unproven now we have see a lot of example of person who be pursue that sort of vision in science but I think it be also true in the art it be true in politics it be even true in personal endeavor what it come down to really be four basic principle learn from everyone follow no one watch for pattern and work like hell I think this be the four principle that go into this and it be that third one especially where vision of the future begin to manifest themselves what be interesting be that this particular way of look at the world be I think only one of four different way that manifest themselves in different field of endeavor in comic I know that it result in sort of a formalist attitude towards try to understand how it work then there be another more classical attitude which embrace beauty and craft another one which believe in the pure transparency of content and then another which emphasize the authenticity of human experience and honesty and rawness this be four very different way of look at the world I even give they name the classicist the animist the formalist and iconoclast interestingly they seem to correspond more or less to Jung four subdivision of human thought and they reflect a dichotomy of art and delight on left and the right tradition and revolution on the top and the bottom and if you go on the diagonal you get content and form and then beauty and truth and it probably apply just as much to music and movie and fine art which have nothing whatsoever to do with vision at all or for that matter nothing to do with we conference theme of inspire by Nature except to the extent of the fable of the frog who give a ride to the scorpion on he back to get across the river because the scorpion promise not to sting he but the scorpion sting he anyway and they both die but not before the frog ask he why and the scorpion say because it be my nature in that sense yes laughter so this be my nature the thing be I see that the route I take to discover this focus in my work and who I be I see it as just this road to discovery actually it be just I embrace my nature which mean that I do not actually fall that far from the tree after all so what do a scientific mind do in the art I start make comic but I also start try to understand they almost immediately one of the most important thing about comic that I discover be that comic be a visual medium but they try to embrace all of the sen within it so the different element of comic like picture and word and the different symbol and everything in between that comic present be all funnel through the single conduit a vision so we have thing like resemblance where something which resemble the physical world can be abstract in a couple of different direction abstract from resemblance but still retain the complete meaning or abstract away from both resemblance and mean towards the picture plane put all this three together and you have a nice little map of the entire boundary of visual iconography which comic can embrace and if you move to the right you also get language because that be abstract even further from resemblance but still maintain mean vision be call upon to represent sound and to understand the common property of that two and they common heritage as well also to try to represent the texture of sound to capture its essential character through visual there be also a balance between the visible and the invisible in comic Comics be a kind of call and response in which the artist give you something to see within the panel and then give you something to imagine between the panel also another sense which comic vision represent and that be time sequence be a very important aspect of comic Comics present a kind of temporal map and this temporal map be something that energize modern comic but I be wonder if perhaps it also energize other sort of form and I find some in history you can see this same principle operating in this ancient version of the same idea what be happen be a art form be collide with a give technology whether it be paint on stone like the Tomb of Menna the Scribe in ancient Egypt or a bas relief sculpture rise up a stone column or a 200 foot long embroidery or paint deerskin and tree bark run across 88 accordion fold page what be interesting be once you hit print and this be from 1450 by the way all of the artifact of modern comic start to present themselves rectilinear panel arrangement simple line draw without tone and a leave to right reading sequence and within 100 year you already start to see word balloon and caption and it be really just a hop skip and a jump from here to here so I write a book about this in 93 but as I be finish the book I have to do a little bit of typesetting and I be tired of go to my local copy shop to do it so I buy a computer and it be just a little thing it be not good for much except text entry but my father have tell I about Moore law back in the 70 and I know what be come and so I keep my eye peel to see if the sort of change that happen when we go from pre print comic to print comic would happen when we go beyond to post print comic so one of the first thing propose be that we could mix the visual of comic with the sound motion and interactivity of the cd rom be make in that day this be even before the web and one of the first thing they do be they try to take the comic page as be and transplant it to monitor which be a classic McLuhanesque mistake of appropriate the shape of the previous technology as the content of the new technology and so what they would do be have this comic page that resemble print comic page and they would introduce all this sound and motion the problem be that if you go with this basic idea that space equal time in comic what happen be that when you introduce sound and motion which be temporal phenomenon that can only be represent through time they break with that continuity of presentation interactivity be another thing there be hypertext comic but the thing about hypertext be that everything in hypertext be either here not here or connect to here it be profoundly nonspatial the distance from Abraham Lincoln to a Lincoln penny to penny Marshall to the Marshall Plan to Plan 9 to nine life it be all the same laughter but in comic every aspect of the work every element of the work have a spatial relationship to every other element at all time so the question be be there any way to preserve that spatial relationship while still take advantage of all of the thing that digital have to offer we and I find my personal answer for this in that ancient comic that I be show you each of they have a single unbroken reading line whether it be go zigzag across the wall or spiral up a column or just straight leave to right or even go in a backwards zigzag across that 88 accordion fold page the same thing be happen that be that the basic idea that as you move through space you move through time be be carry out without any compromise but there be compromise when print hit adjacent space be no long adjacent moment so the basic idea of comic be be break again and again and again and again and I think ok well if that be true be there any way when we go beyond today print to somehow bring that back now the monitor be just as limit as the page technically right it be a different shape but other than that it be the same basic limitation but that be only if you look at the monitor as a page but not if you look at the monitor as a window and that be what I propose that perhaps we could create this comic on a infinite canvas along the x axis and the y axis and staircase we could do circular narrative that be literally circular we could do a turn in a story that be literally a turn parallel narrative could be literally parallel x y and also z so I have all this notion this be back in the late 90 and other person in my business think I be pretty crazy but a lot of person then go on and actually do it I be go to show you a couple now this be a early collage comic by a fellow name Jasen Lex and notice what be go on here what I be search for be a durable mutation that be what all of we be search for as media head into this new era we be look for mutation that be durable that have some sort of stay power now we be take this basic idea of present comic in a visual medium and we be carry it through all the way from begin to end that be that entire comic you just see up on the screen right now but even though we be only experience it one piece at a time that be just where the technology be right now as the technology evolve as you get full immersive display and whatnot this sort of thing will only grow it will adapt it will adapt to its environment it be a durable mutation here be another one this be by Drew Weing this be call pup ponder the heat death of the Universe see what be go on here as we draw this story on a infinite canvas be you be create a more pure expression of what this medium be all about we will go by this a little quickly you get the idea I just want to get to the last panel cat 1 pup earth to pup cat 2 come play baseball with we laughter pup do either of you realize that eventually the universe will be nothing but a thin cold gas spread across infinite lonely space cat 1 oh cat 2 we have good hurry then laughter just one more talk about you infinite canvas it be by a guy name Daniel Merlin Goodbrey in Britain why be this important I think this be important because media all media provide we a window back into we world now it could be that motion picture and eventually virtual reality or something equivalent to it some sort of immersive display be go to provide we with we most efficient escape from the world that we be in that be why most person turn to storytelling to escape but media provide we with a window back into the world we live in and when media evolve so that the identity of the media become increasingly unique because what you be look at be comic cube you be look at comic that be more comic like than they have ever be before when that happen you provide person with multiple way of reenter the world through different window and when you do that it allow they to triangulate the world they live in and see its shape that be why I think this be important one of many reason but I have get to go now thank you for have I
