music applause thank you for be here and I say thank you for be here because I be silent for 17 year and the first word that I speak be in Washington D C on the 20th anniversary of Earth Day and my family and friend have gather there to hear I speak and I say thank you for be here my mother out in the audience she jump up Hallelujah Johnny talk laughter imagine if you be quiet for 17 year and you mother be out in the audience say my dad say to I that one I will explain that but I turn around because I do not recognize where my voice be come from I have not hear my voice in 17 year so I turn around and I look and I say God who be say what I be think and then I realize it be I you know and I kind of laugh and I could see my father yeah he really be crazy well I want to take you on this journey and the journey I believe be a metaphor for all of we journey even though this one be kind of unusual I want you to think about you own journey my journey begin in 1971 when I witness two oil tanker collide beneath the Golden Gate and a half a million gallon of oil spill into the bay it disturb I so much that I decide that I be go to give up ride and drive in motorize vehicle that a big thing in California and it be a big thing in my little community of Point Reyes Station in Inverness California because there be only about 350 person there in the winter this be back in 71 now and so when I come in and I start walk around person they just know what be go on and person would drive up next to I and say John what be you do and I would say well I be walk for the environment and they say no you be walk to make we look bad right you be walk to make we feel bad and maybe there be some truth to that because I think that if I start walk everyone would follow because of the oil everybody talk about the polllution and so I argue with person about that I argue and I argue I call my parent up I say I have give up ride and drive in car my dad say why do not you do that when you be 16 laughter I do not know about the environment then they be back in Philadelphia and so I tell my mother I be happy though I be really happy she say if you be happy son you would not have to say it mother be like that and so on my 27th birthday I decide because I argue so much and I talk so much that I be go to stop speak for just one day one day to give it a rest and so I do I get up in the morning and I do not say a word and I have to tell you it be a very moving experience because for the first time I begin listen in a long time and what I hear it kind of disturb I because what I use to do when I think I be listen be I would listen just enough to hear what person have to say and think that I could I know what they be go to say and so I stop listen and in my mind I just kind of race ahead and think of what I be go to say back while they be still finish up and then I would launch in well that just end communication so on this first day I actually listen and it be very sad for I because I realize that for that many year I have not be learn I be 27 I think I know everything I do not and so I decide I would well do this for another day and another day and another day until finally I promise myself for a year I would keep quiet because I start learn more and more and I need to learn more so for a year I say I would keep quiet and then on my birthday I would reassess what I have learn and maybe I would talk again well that last 17 year now during that time that 17 year I walk and I play the banjo and I paint and I write in my journal and I try to study the environment by read book and I decide that I be go to go to school so I do I walk up to Ashland Oregon where they be offer a environmental study degree it only 500 mile and I go into the Registrar office and what what what I have a newspaper clip oh so you really want to go to school here you do not we have a special program for you they do and in that two year I graduate with my first degree a bachelor degree and my father come out he be so proud he say listen we be really proud of you son but what be you go to do with a bachelor degree you do not ride in car you do not talk you be go to have to do that thing laughter I hunch my shoulder I pick my backpack up again and I start walk I walk all the way up to Port Townsend Washington where I build a wooden boat ride it across Puget Sound and walk across Washington to Idaho and down to Missoula Montana I have write the University of Montana two year early and say I would like to go to school there I say I would be there in about two year laughter and I be there I show up in two year and they I tell this story because they really help I there be two story in Montana the first story be I do not have any money that a sign I use a lot and they say do not worry about that the director of the program say come back tomorrow he give I 150 dollar and he say Register for one credit you be go to go to South America be not you and I say Rivers and lake the hydrological system South America so I do that he come back he say to I ok John now that you have register for that one credit you can have a key to a office you can matriculate you be matriculate so you can use the library and what we be go to do be we be go to have all of the professor allow you to go to class they be go to save you grade and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money then you can register for that class and they will give you the grade wow they do not do that in graduate school I do not think but I use that story because they really want to help I they see that I be really interested in the environment and they really want to help I along the way and during that time I actually teach class without speak I have 13 student when I first walk into the class I explain with a friend who could interpret my sign language that I be John Francis I be walk around the world I do not talk and this be the last time this person go to be here interpret for I all the student sit around and they go laughter I could see they be look for the schedule to see when they could get out they have to take that class with I two week later everyone be try to get into we class and I learn in that class because I would do thing like this and they be all gather around go what be he try to say I do not know I think he be talk about clear cutting yeah clear cut no no no that be not clear cutting that he be use a handsaw well you can not clearcut with a yes you can clear cut no I think he talk about selective forestry now this be a discussion class and we be have a discussion I just back out of that you know and I just kind of keep the fist from fly but what I learn be that sometimes I would make a sign and they say thing that I absolutely do not mean but I should have and so what come to I be if you be a teacher and you be teach if you be not learn you probably be not teach very well and so I go on my dad come out to see I graduate and you know I do the deal and my father say we be really proud of you son but you know what go on he say you have get to start ride and drive and start talk what be you go to do with a master degree I hunch my shoulder I get my

States write on oil spill my dad come out again he say I do not know how you do this son I mean you do not ride in car you do not talk my sister say maybe I should leave you alone because you seem to be do a lot good when you be not say anything laughter well I put on my backpack again I put my banjo on and I walk all the way to the East Coast put my foot in the Atlantic Ocean it be seven year and one day it take I to walk across the United States and on Earth Day 1990 the 20th anniversary of Earth Day that when I begin to speak and that why I say thank you for be here because it be sort of like that tree in the forest fall and if there be no one there to hear do it really make a sound and I be thank you and I be thank my family because they have come to hear I speak and that communication and they also teach I about listen that they listen to I and it one of that thing that come out of the silence the listening to each other really very important we need to listen to each other well my journey keep go on my dad say that one and I still do not let that go I work for the Coastguard be make a u n goodwill Ambassador I write regulation for the United States I mean I write oil spill regulation 20 year ago if someone have say to I John do you really want to make a difference yeah I want to make a difference he say you just start walk east get out of you car and just start walk east and as I walk off a little bit they would say yeah and shut up too laughter you be go to make a difference buddy how could that be how could that be how could do such a simple thing like walk and not talk make a difference well my time at the Coast Guard be a really good time and after that I only work one year I say that be enough one year enough for I to do that I get on a sailboat and I sail down to the Caribbean and walk through all of the island and to Venezuela and you know I forget the most important thing which be why I start talk which I have to tell you I start talk because I have study environment I would study environment at this formal level but there be this informal level and the informal level I learn about person and what we do and how we be and environment change from just be about tree and bird and endanger species to be about how we treat each other because if we be the environment then all we need to do be look around we and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other and so that the message that I have and I say well I be go to have to spread that message and I get in my sailboat sail all the way through the Caribbean it be not really my sailboat I kind of work on that boat get to Venezuela and I start walk this be the last part of this story because it how I get here because I still do not ride in motorize vehicle I be walk through El Dorado it be a prison town famous prison or infamous prison in Venezuela and I do not know what possess I because this be not like I there I be walk past the guard gate and the guard stop and say Pasaporte pasaporte and with a M16 point at I and I look at he and I say Passport huh I do not need to show you my passport it in the back of my pack I be Dr Francis I be a u n Ambassador and I be walk around the world and I start walk off what possess I to say this thing the road turn into the jungle I do not get shoot and I get to I start say Free at last thank God Almighty I be free at last what be that about I be say what be that about it take I 100 mile to figure out that in my heart in I I have become a prisoner I be a prisoner and I need to escape the prison that I be in be the fact that I do not drive or use motorize vehicle now how could that be because when I start it seem very appropriate to I not to use motorize vehicle but the thing that be different be that every birthday I ask myself about silence but I never ask myself about my decision to just use my foot I have no idea I be go to become a u n Ambassador I have no idea I would have a ph d and so I realize that I have a responsibility to more than just I and that I be go to have to change you know we can do it I be go to have to change and I be afraid to change because I be so use to the guy who only just walk I be so use to that person that I do not want to stop I do not know who I would be if I change but I know I need to I know I need to change because it would be the only way that I could be here today and I know that a lot of time we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we have get to but there another place for we to go and we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we have become and go to the place of who we be become and so I want to encourage you to go to that next place to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in as comfortable as it may be because we have to do something now we have to change now as we former Vice President say we have to become activist so if my voice can touch you if my action can touch you if my be here can touch you please let it be and I know that all of you have touch I while I have be here so let go out into the world and take this care this love this respect that we have show each other right here at TED and take this out into the world because we be the environment and how we treat each other be really how we be go to treat the environment so I want to thank you for be here and I want to end this in five second of silence thank you applause
