what I want to talk about be as background be the idea that car be art this be actually quite meaningful to I because car designer tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole we do not do coffee table book with just one lamp inside of it and car be think so much as a product that it be a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art and so car as art bring it into a emotional plane if you accept that that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital a now at this point you be go to see a picture of Michelangelo this be completely different than automobile automobile be self move thing right elevator be automobile and they be not very emotional they solve a purpose and certainly automobile have be around for 100 year and have make we life functionally a lot good in many way they have also be a real pain in the ass because automobile be really the thing we have to solve we have to solve the pollution we have to solve the congestion but that be not what interest I in this speech what interest I in this speech be car automobile may be what you use but car be what we be in many way and as long as we can solve the problem of automobile and I believe we can with fuel cell or hydrogen like BMW be really hip on and lot of other thing then I think we can look past that and try and understand why this hook be in many of we of this car y ness and what that mean what we can learn from it that be what I want to get to car be not a suit of clothes car be a avatar car be a expansion of yourself they take you think you idea you emotion and they multiply it you anger whatever it be a avatar it be a super waldo that you happen to be inside of and if you feel sexy the car be sexy and if you be full of road rage you have get a Chevy like a Rock right car be a sculpture do you know this that every car you see out there be sculpt by hand many person think well it be computer and it be do by machine and stuff like that well they reproduce it but the original be all do by hand it be do by man and woman who believe a lot in they craft and they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum that tension between the need to express the need to discover then you put something new into it and at the same time you have bind of craftsmanship rule that say this be how you handle surface this be what control be all about this be how you show you be a master of you craft and that tension that discovery that push for something new and at the same time that sense of obligation to the regards of craftsmanship that be as strong in car as it be in anything we work in clay which have not change much since Michelangelo start screw around with it and there be a very interesting analogy to that too real quickly Michelangelo once say he be there to discover the figure within ok there we go the automobile that be 100 year right there do you catch that between that one there and that one there it change a lot do not it ok it be not market there be a very interesting car concept here but the marketing part be not what I want to talk about here I want to talk about this why it mean you have to wash a car what be it that sensuality you have to touch about it that be the sculpture that go into it that sensuality and it be do by man and woman work just like this make car now this little quote about sculpture from Henry Moore I believe that that pressure within that Moore talk about at least when it come to car come right back to this idea of the mean it be that will to live that need to survive to express itself that come in a car and take over person like I and we tell other person do this do this do this until this thing come alive we be completely infected and beauty can be the result of this infectiousness it be quite wonderful this sculpture be of course at the heart of all of it and it be really what put the craftsmanship into we car and it be not a whole lot different really when they be work like this or when somebody work like this it be that same kind of commitment that same kind of beauty now now I get to the point I want to talk about car as art art in the Platonic sense be truth it be beauty and love now this be really where designer in car business diverge from the engineer we do not really have a problem talk about love we do not have a problem talk about truth or beauty in that sense that be what we be search for when we be work we craft we be really try to find that truth out there we be not try to find vanity and beauty we be try to find the beauty in the truth however engineer tend to look at thing a little bit more Newtonian instead of this quantum approach we be deal with irrationalism and we be deal with paradox that we admit exist and the engineer tend to look thing a little bit more like two and two be four and if you get 4 0 it be good and 4 000 be even good and that sometimes lead to bit of a divergence in why we be do what we be do we have pretty much accept the fact though that we be the woman in the organization at BMW BMW be a very manly type business man man man it be engineer and we be kind of the female side to that that be ok that be cool you go off and be manly we be go to be a little bit more female because what we be interested in be find form that be more than just a function we be interested in find beauty that be more than just a aesthetic it be really a truth and I think this idea of soul as be at the heart of great car be very applicable you all know it you know a car when you have see it with soul you know how strong this be well this experience of love and the experience of design to I be interchangeable and now I be come to my story I discover something about love and design through a project call Deep Blue and first of all you have to go with I for a second and say you know you could take the word love out of a lot of thing in we society put the word design in and it still work like this quote here you know it kind of work you know you can understand that it work in truism all be fair in design and war certainly we live in a competitive society I think this one here there be a pop song that really describe Philippe Starck for I you know this be like you know this be like puppy love you know this be cool right Toothbrush cool it really only get serious when you look at something like this ok laughter this be one substitution that I believe all of we in design management be guilty of and this idea that there be more to love more to design when it get down to you neighbor you other it can be physical like this and maybe in the future it will be but right now it be in deal with we own person we own team who be do the create so to my story the idea of person work be what we work with here and I have to make a bond with my designer when we be create BMWs we have to have a share intimacy a share vision that mean we have to work as one family we have to understand ourselves that way there be good time there be interesting time and there be some stress time too you want to do car you have get to go outside you have get to do car in the rain you have get to do car in the snow that be by the way be a presentation we make to we board of director we haul they butt out in the snow too you want to know car outside well you have get to stand outside to do this and because this be artist they have very artistic temperament all right now one thing about art be art be discovery and art be discover yourself through you art right and one thing about car be we be all a little bit like Pygmalion we be completely in love with we own creation this be one of my favorite painting it really describe we relationship with car this be sick beyond belief laughter but because of this the intimacy with which we work together as a team take on a new dimension a new meaning we have a share center we have a share focus that car stay at the middle of all we relationship and it be my job in the competitive process to narrow this down I hear today about Joseph death gene that have to go in and kill cell reproduction you know that be what I have to do sometimes we start out with 10 car we narrow it down to five car down to three car down to two car down to one car and I be in the middle of that kill basically someone love someone baby this be very difficult and you have to have a bond with you team that permit you to do this because they life be wrap up in that too they have get that gene infect in they as well and they want that to live more than anything else well this project Deep Blue put I in contact with my team in a way that I never expect and I want to pass it on to you because I want you to reflect on this perhaps in you own relationship we want to a do a car which be a complete leap of faith for BMW we want to do a team which be so remove from the way we have do it that I only have a phone number that connect I to they so what we do be instead of have a staff of artist that be just you wrist we decide to free up a team of creative designer and engineer to find out what be the successor to the suv phenomenon in America this be 1996 we do this project and so we send they off with this team name Deep Blue now many person know Deep Blue from IBM we actually steal it from they because we figure if anybody read we fax they would think we be talk about computer it turn out it be quite clever because Deep Blue in a company like BMW have a hook deep blue wow cool name so person get wrap up in it and we take a team of designer and we send they off to America and we give they a budget what we think be a set of deliverable a timetable and nothing else like I say I just have a phone number that connect I to they and a group of engineer work in Germany and the idea be they would work separately on this problem of what be the successor to the suv they would come together compare note then they would work apart come together and they would produce together a monumental set of diverse opinion that do not pollute each other idea but at the same time come together and resolve the problem hopefully really understand the customer at its heart where the customer be live with they in America so send the team off and actually something different happen they go other place laughter they disappear quite honestly and all I get be postcard now I get some postcard of this guy in Las Vegas and I get some postcard of this guy in the Grand Canyon and I get this postcard of Niagara Falls and pretty soon they be in New York and I do not know where else and I be tell myself this be go to be a great car they be do research that I have never even think about before right and they decide that instead of like have a studio and six or seven apartment it be cheap to rent Elizabeth Taylor ex house in Malibu and at least they tell I it be she house I guess it be at one time she have a party there or something but anyway this be the house and they all live there now this be 24 7 live half a dozen person who have leave they some have leave they wife behind and family behind and they literally live in this house for the entire six month the project be in America but the first three month be the most intensive and one of the young woman in the project she be a fantastic lady she actually build she room in the bathroom the bathroom be so big she build the bed over the bathtub it be quite fascinating on the other hand I do not know anything about this ok nothing this be all go on and all I be get be postcard of this guy in Las Vegas or whatever say do not worry Chris this be really go to be good ok so my concept of what a design studio be probably I be not up to speed on where this guy be however the engineer back in Munich have take on this kind of Newtonian solution and they be try to find how many cup holder can dance on the head of a pin and you know this really serious question that be confront the modern consumer and one be hope that this two team would get together and this collusion of incredible creativity under this incredible surroundings and this incredibly stress out engineer would create some incredible solution well what I do not know be and what we find out be this guy they can not even like talk to each other under that condition you get a divergence of Newtonian and quantum thinking at that point you have a split in you dialog that be so deep and so far that they can not bring this together at all and so we have we first meeting after three month in Tiburon which be just up the road from here you know Tiburon and the idea be after the first three month of this independent research they would present it all to Dr Goschel who be now my boss and at that time he be co mentor on the project and they would present they result we would see where we be go we would see the first indication of what could be the successive phenomenon to the suv in America and so I have this idea in my head that this be go to be great I mean I be go to see so much work it be so intense I know probably Las Vegas mean a lot about it and I be not really sure where the Grand Canyon come in either but somehow all this be go to come together and I be go to see some really great product so we go to Tiburon after three month and the team have get together the week before many day ahead of time the engineer fly over and designer get together with they and they put they presentation together well it turn out that the engineer have not do anything and they have not do anything because kind of like in car business engineer be there to solve problem and we be ask they to create a problem and the engineer be wait for the designer to say this be the problem that we have create now help we solve it and they could not talk about it so what happen be the engineer show up with nothing and the engineer tell the designer if you go in with all you stuff we will walk out we will walk right out of the project so I do not know any of this and we get a presentation that have a agenda look like this there be a whole lot of dialog we spend four hour be tell all about vocabulary that need to be build between engineer and designer and here I be expect at any moment ok they be go to turn the page and I be go to see the car I be go to see the sketch I be go to see maybe some idea of where it be go Dialog keep on go with mental map of word and pretty soon it be become obvious that instead of be dazzle with brilliance I be seriously be baffle with bullshit and if you can imagine what this be like to have this month of postcard indication of how great this team be work and they be out there spend all this money and they be learn and they be do all this stuff I go fucking ballistic right I go nut you can probably remember Tiburon it use to look like this after four hour of this I stand up and I take this team apart I scream at they I yell at they what the hell be you do you be let I down you be my designer you be suppose to be the creative one what the hell be go on around here it be probably one of my good tirade I have some good one but this be probably one of my good one and I go into this person how could they take BMW money how could they have a holiday for three month and produce nothing nothing because of course they do not tell we that they have three station wagon full of draw model concept picture everything I want they have lock up in the car because they have show solidarity with the engineer and they would decide not to show I anything in order to give the chance for problem solve a chance to start because they have not realize of course that they could not do problem create so we go to lunch laughter and I have get to tell you this be one seriously quiet lunch the engineer all sit at one end of the table the designer and I sit at the other end of the table really quiet and I be just fucking furious furious ok probably because they have all the fun and I do not you know that be what you get furious about right and somebody ask I about Catherine my wife you know do she fly out with I or something I say no and it trigger a set of thought about my wife and I recall that when Catherine and I be marry the priest give a very nice sermon and he say something very important he say love be not selfish he say Love do not mean count how many time I say I love you it do not mean you have sex this many time this month and it be two time less than last month so that mean you do not love I as much love be not selfish and I think about this and I think you know I be not show love here I be seriously not show love I be in the air I be in the air without trust this can not be this can not be that I be expect a certain number of sketch and to I that be my quantification method for qualify a team this can not be so I tell they this story I say guy I be think about something here this be not right I can not have a relationship with you guy base on a premise that be a quantifiable one base on a dictate premise that say I be a boss you do what I say without trust I say this can not be actually we all break down into tear to be quite honest about it because they still could not tell I how much frustration they have build up inside of they not be able to show I what I want and merely have to ask I to trust they that it would come and I think we feel much close that day we cut a lot of string that do not need to be there and we forge the concept for what real team and creativity be all about we put the car back at the center of we think and we put love I think truly back into the center of the process by the way that team go on to create six different concept for the next model of what would be the proposal for the next generation after suv in America one of that be the idea of a crossover coupe you see it downstairs the X Coupe they have a lot of fun with that it be the rendition of we motorcycle the g as Carl Magnusson say brute iful as the idea of what could be a motorcycle if you add two more wheel and so in conclusion my lesson that I want to pass on to you be this one here I be also go to steal a little quote out of little Prince there be a lot to be say about trust and love if you know that that two word be synonymous for design I have a very very meaningful relationship with my team that day and it be stay that way ever since and I hope that you too find that there be more to design and more towards the art of the design than do it yourself it be true that the trust and the love that make it worthwhile thanks so much applause
