and the man say he be come down a long way have not he laughter applause there be be kind of a series of epiphany laughter the very next day continue the totally true story I get on a g v to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria in the city of Lagos on the topic of energy and I begin the speech by tell they the story of what have just happen the day before in Nashville and I tell it pretty much the same way I have just share it with you Tipper and I be drive ourselves Shoney low cost family restaurant chain what the man say they laugh I give my speech then go back out to the airport to fly back home I fall asleep on the plane until during the middle of the night we land on the Azores Islands for refuel I wake up they open the door I go out to get some fresh air and I look and there be a man run across the runway and he be wave a piece of paper and he be yell call Washington Call Washington and I think to myself in the middle of the night in the middle of the Atlantic what in the world could be wrong in Washington then I remember it could be a bunch of thing laughter but what it turn out to be be that my staff be extremely upset because one of the wire service in Nigeria have already write a story about my speech and it have already be print in city all across the United States of America it be print in Monterey I check laughter and the story begin former Vice President Al Gore announce in Nigeria yesterday quote my wife Tipper and I have open a low cost family restaurant laughter name Shoney and we be run it ourselves laughter before I could get back to U S soil David Letterman and Jay Leno have already start in on one of they have I in a big white chef hat Tipper be say one more burger with fries laughter three day later I get a nice long handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton say congratulation on the new restaurant Al laughter we like to celebrate each other success in life laughter I be go to talk about information ecology but I be think that since I plan to make a lifelong habit of come back to TED that maybe I could talk about that another time applause Chris Anderson it be a deal applause Al Gore I want to focus on what many of you have say you would like I to elaborate on what can you do about the climate crisis I want to start with a couple of I be go to show some new image and I be go to recapitulate just four or five now the slide show I update the slide show every time I give it I add new image because I learn more about it every time I give it it be like beach comb you know every time the tide come in and out you find some more shell just in the last two day we get the new temperature record in January this be just for the United States of America historical average for Januarys be 31 degree last month be 39 5 degree now I know that you want some more bad news about the environment I be kid but this be the recapitulation slide and then I be go to go into new material about what you can do but I want to elaborate on a couple of this First of all this be where we be project to go with the U S contribution to global warming under business as usual efficiency in end use electricity and end use of all energy be the low hang fruit efficiency and conservation it be not a cost it be a profit the sign be wrong it be not negative it be positive this be investment that pay for themselves but they be also very effective in deflect we path car and truck I talk about that in the slideshow but I want you to put it in perspective it be a easy visible target of concern and it should be but there be more global warming pollution that come from building than from car and truck car and truck be very significant and we have the low standard in the world and so we should address that but it be part of the puzzle other transportation efficiency be as important as car and truck renewable at the current level of technological efficiency can make this much difference and with what Vinod and John Doerr and other many of you here there be a lot of person directly involve in this this wedge be go to grow much more rapidly than the current projection show it Carbon capture and sequestration that be what cc stand for be likely to become the killer app that will enable we to continue to use fossil fuel in a way that be safe not quite there yet ok now what can you do reduce emission in you home most of this expenditure be also profitable Insulation good design buy green electricity where you can I mention automobile buy a hybrid use light rail figure out some of the other option that be much good it be important be a green consumer you have choice with everything you buy between thing that have a harsh effect or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis consider this make a decision to live a carbon neutral life that of you who be good at brand I would love to get you advice and help on how to say this in a way that connect with the most person it be easy than you think it really be a lot of we in here have make that decision and it be really pretty easy it mean reduce you carbon dioxide emission with the full range of choice that you make and then purchase or acquire offset for the remainder that you have not completely reduce and what it mean be elaborate at climatecrisis net there be a carbon calculator participant Productions convene with my active involvement the leading software writer in the world on this arcane science of carbon calculation to construct a consumer friendly carbon calculator you can very precisely calculate what you co2 emission be and then you will be give option to reduce and by the time the movie come out in May this will be update to 2 0 and we will have click through purchase of offset next consider make you business carbon neutral again some of we have do that and it be not as hard as you think integrate climate solution into all of you innovation whether you be from the technology or entertainment or design and architecture community Invest sustainably Majora mention this listen if you have invest money with manager who you compensate on the basis of they annual performance do not ever again complain about quarterly report ceo management over time person do what you pay they to do and if they judge how much they be go to get pay on you capital that they have invest base on the short term return you be go to get short term decision a lot more to be say about that become a catalyst of change teach other learn about it talk about it the movie be a movie version of the slideshow I give two night ago except it be a lot more entertaining and it come out in May many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of person see it consider send somebody to Nashville pick well and I be personally go to train person to give this slideshow re purpose with some of the personal story obviously replace with a generic approach and it be not just the slide it be what they mean and it be how they link together and so I be go to be conduct a course this summer for a group of person that be nominate by different folk to come and then give it en masse in community all across the country and we be go to update the slideshow for all of they every single week to keep it right on the cut edge work with Larry Lessig it will be somewhere in that process post with tool and limited use copyright so that young person can remix it and do it in they own way applause where do anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm length from politics it do not mean that if you be a Republican that I be try to convince you to be a Democrat we need Republican as well this use to be a bipartisan issue and I know that in this group it really be become politically active make we democracy work the way it be suppose to work support the idea of cap carbon dioxide emission global warm pollution and trading it here be why as long as the United States be out of the world system it be not a closed system once it become a closed system with U S participation then everybody who be on a board of director how many person here serve on the board of director of a corporation once it be a closed system you will have legal liability if you do not urge you ceo to get the maximum income from reduce and trade the carbon emission that can be avoid the market will work to solve this problem if we can accomplish this help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring we have to change the mind of the American person because presently the politician do not have permission to do what need to be do and in we modern country the role of logic and reason no long include mediate between wealth and power the way it once do it be now repetition of short hot button 30 second 28 second television ad we have to buy a lot of that ad let re brand global warming as many of you have suggest I like climate crisis instead of climate collapse but again that of you who be good at brand I need you help on this somebody say the test we be face now a scientist tell I be whether the combination of a opposable thumb and a neocortex be a viable combination laughter that be really true I say the other night and I will repeat now this be not a political issue again the Republican here this should not be partisan you have more influence than some of we who be Democrat do this be a opportunity not just this but connect to the idea that be here to bring more coherence to they we be one thank you very much I appreciate it applause
