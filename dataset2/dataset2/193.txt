by day I be a venture capitalist on weekend I love rocket I love photography I love rocket I be go to talk about a hobby that can scale and show you photo I have take over the year with kid like this that hopefully will grow up to love rocketry and eventually become a Richard Branson or Diamandis my son design a rocket that become stable a golf ball rocket I think it be quite a interesting experiment in the principle of rocket science and it fly straight as a arrow baking soda and vinegar night shot be beautiful pierce the big Dipper and the Milky Way 2 stage rocket with video camera on they onboard computer log they flight rocket glider that fly back to Earth I use RockSim to simulate flight before they go to see if they will break supersonic then fly they with onboard computer to verify performance to launch the big stuff you go to the middle of nowhere Black Rock Desert where dangerous thing happen the boy and the rocket get big they use motor use on cruise missile booster they rumble the belly and leave even photographer in awe watch the spectacle this rocket use experimental motor like nitrous oxide they use solid propellant most frequently it be a strange kind of love RocketMavericks com with my photo if you want to learn about this participate be a spectator we have to call it Rocket Mavericks this one be great go to 100 000 foot but do not quite actually it go 11 foot into solid clay and become a bunker buster it have to be dig out Rockets often spiral out of control if you put too much propellant in they here be a drag race at night you can see what happen in a second in daytime we call they land shark sometimes they just explode before you eye or come down supersonic laughter to take this shot I do what I often do which be go way beyond the pad where none of the spectator be and if we can run the video I will show you what it take to get this DreamWorks shoot Video Voices Woo hoo yeah Nice Steve Jurvetson they realize the computer fail they be yell Deploy Video Man Oh shit sj this be when they realize everything go haywire Video Man it be go ballistic sj I will just be quiet Video Woman No come on come on come on sj and that be I over there take photo the whole way thing often go wrong some person watch this because of a NASCAR like fascination with thing bump and grind burn the parachute as it fall that be last weekend this guy go up go supersonic rip the fin can off the art sale in the sky a burn metal hunk come back this thing drop down from above all through the weekend of rocket launch after rocket launch it be a cadence you can not quite imagine I try to capture the mishap it be a challenge in photography when this thing take place in a fraction of a second why do it for thing like this gene from Alabama drive out there with this rocket he be build with x ray sensor video camera festoon with electronics he succeed get to 100 000 foot leave the atmosphere see a thin blue line of space it be this breathtaking image success of course that motivate we and motivate kid to follow and understand rocket science understand the importance of physics and math and in many way to have that awe at exploration of the frontier of the unknown thank you applause
