I be go to talk to you today about hopefully convert fear into hope when we go to the physician today when we go to the doctor office and we walk in there be word that we just do not want to hear there be word that we be truly afraid of diabetes cancer Parkinson Alzheimer heart failure lung failure thing that we know be debilitate disease for which there be relatively little that can be do and what I want to lay out for you today be a different way of think about how to treat debilitate disease why it be important why without it perhaps we health care system will melt down if you think it already have not and where we be clinically today and where we might go tomorrow and what some of the hurdle be and we be go to do all of that in 18 minute I promise I want to start with this slide because this slide sort of tell the story the way Science Magazine think of it this be a issue from 2002 that they publish with a lot of different article on the bionic human it be basically a regenerative medicine issue regenerative medicine be a extraordinarily simple concept that everybody can understand it be simply accelerate the pace at which the body heal itself to a clinically relevant timescale so we know how to do this in many of the way that be up there we know that if we have a damage hip you can put a artificial hip in and this be the idea that Science Magazine use on they front cover this be the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine this be not regenerative medicine regenerative medicine be what Business Week put up when they do a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago the idea be that instead of figure out how to ameliorate symptom with device and drug and the like and I will come back to that theme a few time instead of do that we will regenerate lose function of the body by regenerate the function of organ and damage tissue so that at the end of the treatment you be the same as you be at the beginning of the treatment very few good idea if you agree that this be a good idea very few good idea be truly novel and this be just the same if you look back in history Charles Lindbergh who be well know for fly airplane be actually one of the first person along with Alexis Carrel one of the Nobel Laureates from Rockefeller to begin to think about could you culture organ and they publish this book in 1937 where they actually begin to think about what could you do in bio reactor to grow whole organ we have come a long way since then I be go to share with you some of the exciting work that be go on but before do that what I would like to do be share my depression about the health care system and the need for this with you many of the talk yesterday talk about improve the quality of life and reduce poverty and essentially increase life expectancy all around the globe one of the challenge be that the rich we be the long we live and the long we live the more expensive it be to take care of we disease as we get old this be simply the wealth of a country versus the percent of population over the age of 65 and you can basically see that the rich a country be the old the person be within it why be this important and why be this a particularly dramatic challenge right now if the average age of you population be 30 then the average kind of disease that you have to treat be maybe a broken ankle every now and again maybe a little bit of asthma if the average age in you country be 45 to 55 now the average person be look at diabetes early onset diabetes heart failure coronary artery disease thing that be inherently more difficult to treat and much more expensive to treat just have a look at the demographic in the U S here this be from the Untied States of America in 1930 there be 41 worker per retiree 41 person who be basically outside of be really sick pay for the one retiree who be experience debilitate disease in 2010 two worker per retiree in the U S and this be match in every industrialize wealthy country in the world how can you actually afford to treat patient when the reality of get old look like this this be age versus cost of health care and you can see that right around age 45 40 to 45 there be a sudden spike in the cost of health care it be actually quite interesting if you do the right study you can look at how much you as a individual spend on you own health care plot over you lifetime and about seven year before you be about to die there be a spike and you can actually laughter we will not get into that laughter there be very few thing very few thing that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat this kind of disease and experience what I would call healthy aging I have suggest there be four thing and none of this thing include a insurance system or a legal system all that thing do be change who pay they do not actually change what the actual cost of the treatment be one thing you can do be not treat you can ration health care we will not talk about that anymore it be too depressing you can prevent obviously a lot of money should be put into prevention but perhaps most interesting to I anyway and most important be the idea of diagnose a disease much early on in the progression and then treat the disease to cure the disease instead of treat a symptom think of it in term of diabetes for instance today with diabetes what do we do we diagnose the disease eventually once it become symptomatic and then we treat the symptom for 10 20 30 40 year and we do ok insulin a pretty good therapy but eventually it stop work and diabetes lead to a predictable onset of debilitate disease why could not we just inject the pancreas with something to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease perhaps even before it be symptomatic and it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we do it but if it work we would truly be able to do something different this video I think get across the concept that I be talk about quite dramatically this be a newt re grow its limb if a newt can do this kind of thing why can not we I will actually show you some more important feature about limb regeneration in a moment but what we be talk about in regenerative medicine be do this in every organ system of the body for tissue and for organ themselves so today reality be that if we get sick the message be we will treat you symptom and you need to adjust to a new way of life I would pose to you that tomorrow and when tomorrow be we could debate but it be within the foreseeable future we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation there be a limb prosthetic up here similar actually one on the soldier that be come back from Iraq there be 370 soldier that have come back from Iraq that have lose limb imagine if instead of face that they could actually face the regeneration of that limb it be a wild concept I will show you where we be at the moment in work towards that concept but it be applicable again to every organ system how can we do that the way to do that be to develop a conversation with the body we need to learn to speak the body language and to switch on process that we know how to do when we be a fetus a mammalian fetus if it lose a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy will be grow that limb so we dna have the capacity to do this kind of wound healing mechanism it be a natural process but it be lose as we age in a child before the age of about six month if they lose they fingertip in a accident they will re grow they fingertip by the time they be five they will not be able to do that anymore so to engage in that conversation with the body we need to speak the body language and there be certain tool in we toolbox that allow we to do this today I be go to give you a example of three of this tool through which to converse with the body the first be cellular therapy clearly we heal ourselves in a natural process use cell to do most of the work therefore if we can find the right cell and implant they in the body they may do the healing secondly we can use material we hear yesterday about the importance of new material if we can invent material design material or extract material from a natural environment then we might be able to have that material induce the body to heal itself and finally we may be able to use smart device that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal I be go to show you a example of each of this and I be go to start with material Steve Badylak who be at the University of Pittsburgh about a decade ago have a remarkable idea and that idea be that the small intestine of a pig if you throw away all the cell and if you do that in a way that allow it to remain biologically active may contain all of the necessary factor and signal that would signal the body to heal itself and he ask a very important question he ask the question if I take that material which be a natural material that usually induce healing in the small intestine and I place it somewhere else on a person body would it give a tissue specific response or would it make small intestine if I try to make a new ear I would not be tell you this story if it be not compelling the picture I be about to show you be a compelling picture laughter however for that of you that be even the slight bit squeamish even though you may not like to admit it in front of you friend the light be down this be a good time to look at you foot check you blackberry do anything other than look at the screen laughter what I be about to show you be a diabetic ulcer and although it be good to laugh before we look at this this be the reality of diabetes I think a lot of time we hear about diabetic diabetic ulcer we just do not connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment which be amputation if you can not heal it so I be go to put the slide up now it will not be up for long this be a diabetic ulcer it be tragic the treatment for this be amputation this be a old lady she have cancer of the liver as well as diabetes and have decide to die with what s left of she body intact and this lady decide after a year of attempt treatment of that ulcer that she would try this new therapy that Steve invent that be what the wound look like 11 week later that material contain only natural signal and that material induce the body to switch back on a healing response that it do not have before there be go to be a couple more distressing slide for that of you I will let you know when you can look again this be a horse the horse be not in pain if the horse be in pain I would not show you this slide the horse just have another nostril that be develop because of a riding accident just a few week after treatment in this case take that material turn it into a gel and packing that area and then repeat the treatment a few time and the horse heal up and if you take a ultrasound of that area it would look great here be a dolphin where the fin be be re attach there be now 400 000 patient around the world who have use that material to heal they wound could you regenerate a limb DARPA just give Steve 15 million dollar to lead a eight institution project to begin the process of ask that question and I will show you the 15 million dollar picture this be a 78 year old man who be lose the end of he fingertip remember that I mention before the child who lose they fingertip after treatment that be what it look like this be happen today this be clinically relevant today there be material that do this here be the heart patch but could you go a little further could you say instead of use material can I take some cell along with the material and remove a damaged piece of tissue put a bio degradable material on there you can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish this be do by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women Hospital he can actually grow beat tissue in a dish he chill the dish it change its property and he peel it right out of the dish it be the cool stuff now I be go to show you cell base regeneration and what I be go to show you here be stem cell be remove from the hip of a patient again if you be squeamish you do not want to watch but this one kind of cool so this be a bypass operation just like what Al Gore have with a difference in this case at the end of the bypass operation you be go to see the stem cell from the patient that be remove at the beginning of the procedure be inject directly into the heart of the patient and I be stand up here because at one point I be go to show you just how early this technology be here go the stem cell right into the beating heart of the patient and if you look really carefully it be go to be right around this point you will actually see a back flush you see the cell come back out we need all sort of new technology new device to get the cell to the right place at the right time just a little bit of datum a tiny bit of datum this be a randomized trial at this time this be a n of 20 now there be a n of about 100 basically if you take a extremely sick patient and you give they a bypass they get a little bit well if you give they stem cell as well as they bypass for this particular patient they become asymptomatic this be now two year out the cool thing would be be if you could diagnose the disease early and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state this be the same procedure but now do minimally invasively with only three hole in the body where they be take the heart and simply inject stem cell through a laparoscopic procedure there go the cell we do not have time to go into all of that detail but basically that work too you can take patient who be less sick and bring they back to a almost asymptomatic state through that kind of therapy here be another example of stem cell therapy that be not quite clinical yet but I think very soon will be this be the work of Kacey Marra from Pittsburgh along with a number of colleague around the world they have decide that liposuction fluid which in the United States we have a lot of liposuction fluid laughter it be a great source of stem cell stem cell be pack in that liposuction fluid so you could go in you could get you tummy tuck out come the liposuction fluid and in this case the stem cell be isolate and turn into neuron all do in the lab and I think fairly soon you will see patient be treat with they own fat derive or adipose derive stem cell I talk before about the use of device to dramatically change the way we treat disease here be just one example before I close up this be equally tragic we have a very abide and heartbreaking partnership with we colleague at the Institute for Surgical Research in the US Army who have to treat the now 11 000 kid that have come back from Iraq many of that patient be very severely burn and if there be anything that be be learn about burn it be that we do not know how to treat it everything that be do to treat burn basically we do a sodding approach we make something over here and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound and we try and get the two to take in this case here a new wearable bio reactor have be design it should be test clinically later this year at ISR by Joerg Gerlach in Pittsburgh and that bio reactor will lay down in the wound bed the gun that you see there spray cell that be go to spray cell over that area the reactor will serve to fertilize the environment deliver other thing as well at the same time and therefore we will seed that lawn as oppose to try the sodding approach it be a completely different way of do it so my 18 minute be up so let I finish up with some good news and maybe a little bit of bad news the good news be that this be happen today it be very powerful work clearly the image kind of get that across it be incredibly difficult because it be highly inter disciplinary almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice be involve in try to get this to happen a number of government and a number of region have recognize that this be a new way to treat disease the Japanese government be perhaps the first when they decide to invest first 3 billion later another 2 billion in this field it be no coincidence Japan be the old country on earth in term of its average age they need this to work or they health system die so they be put a lot of strategic investment focus in this area the European Union same thing China the same thing China just launch a national tissue engineering center the first year budget be 250 million US dollar in the United States we have have a somewhat different approach laughter oh for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president we have have a different approach and the approach have basically be to just sort of fund thing as they come along but there be be no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary thing to bear and focus they in a careful way and I be go to finish up with a quote maybe a little cheap shot at the director of the NIH who be a very charming man myself and Jay Vacanti from Harvard go to visit with he and a number of he director of he institute just a few month ago to try and convince he that it be time to take just a little piece of that 27 5 billion dollar that he be go to get next year and focus it in a strategic way to make sure we can accelerate the pace at which this thing get to patient and at the end of a very testy meeting what the NIH director say be you vision be large than we appetite I would like to close by say that no one be go to change we vision but together we can change he appetite thank you
