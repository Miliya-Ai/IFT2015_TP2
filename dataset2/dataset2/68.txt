we be go to talk my a new lecture just for TED and I be go show you some illusion that we have create for TED and I be go to try to relate this to happiness what I be think about with happiness be what give happiness or happiness which I equate with joy in my particular area and I think there be something very fundamental and I be think about this and it be in term of both illusion and movie that we go see and joke and magic show be that there be something about this thing where we expectation be violate in some sort of pleasing way you go see a movie and it have a unexpected twist something that you do not expect and you find a joyful experience you look at that sort of illusion in my book and it be not as what you would expect and there be something joyful about it and it be the same thing with joke and all this sort of thing so what I be go to try and do in my lecture be go a little bit far and see if I can violate you expectation in a pleasing way I mean sometimes expectation that be violate be not pleasant but I be go to try to do it in a pleasant way in a very primal way so I can make the audience here happy so I be go to show you some way that we can violate you expectation first of all I want to show you the particular illusion here I want you first of all when it pop up on the screen to notice that the two hole be perpendicular to each other this be all perceptual trick this be real object that I be go to show you now I be go to show you how it be do I have loop the film here so you can get a very interesting experience I want you to see how this illusion be construct and it be go to rotate so you see that it be inside out now watch as it rotate back how quickly you perception snap ok now watch it as it rotate back again and this be a very bright audience all right see if you can stop it from happen even though you know 100 percent it be true that bam you can not undo it what do that tell you about yourselve we be go to do it again no doubt about it see if you can stop it from happen no it be difficult and we can violate you expectation in a whole variety of way about representation about shape about color and so forth and it be very primal and it be a interesting question to ponder why this thing we find this thing joyful why would we find they joyful so here be something that Lionel do a while ago I like this sort of little thing like this again this be not a optical trick this be what you would see in other word it be not a camera cut it be a perceptual trick ok we can violate you expectation about shape we can violate you expectation on representation what a image represent what do you see here how many of you here see dolphin raise you hand if you see dolphin ok that person who raise they hand afterwards the rest of the audience go talk to they all right actually this be the good example of priming by experience that I know if you be a child under the age of 10 who have not be ruin yet you will look at this image and see dolphin now some of you adult here be say what dolphin what dolphin but in fact if you reverse the figure ground in other word the dark area here I forget to ask for a pointer but if you reverse it you will see a whole series of little dolphin by the way if you be also a student at CalTech they also tend to just see the dolphin it be base on experience now something like this can be use because this be after all talk about design too this be do by Saatchi and Saatchi and they actually get away with this ad in Australia so if you look at this ad for beer all that person be in sort of provocative position but they get it pass and actually win the Clio award so it be funny how you can do this thing remember that sort of um this be the joke I do when the Florida ballot be go around you know count the dot for Gore count the dot for Bush count em again you can violate you expectation about experience here be a outside water fountain that I create with some friend of mine but you can stop the water in drop and actually make all the drop levitate this be something we be build for you know amusement park and that kind of stuff now let take a static image can you see this do you see the middle section move down and the outer section move up it be completely static it be a static image how many person see this illusion it be completely static right now when it be interesting that when we look at a image we see you know color depth texture and you can look at this whole scene and analyze it you can see the woman be in close than the wall and so forth but the whole thing be actually flat it be paint it be trompe l oeil and it be such a good trompe l oeil that person get irritated when they try to talk to the woman and she would not respond now you can make design mistake like this building in New York so that when you see it from this side it look like the balcony tilt up and when you walk around to the other side it look like the balcony go down so there be case where you have mistake in design that incorporate illusion or you take this particular un retouch photograph now interestingly enough I get a lot of email from person who say be there any perceptual difference between male and female and I really say no I mean woman can navigate through the world just as well as male can and why would not they however this be the one illusion that woman can consistently do good than male in matching which head because they rely on fashion cue they can match the hat okay now get to a part I want to show design in illusion I believe that the first example of illusion be use purposely be by da Vinci in this anamorphic image of a eye so that when you see from one little angle be like this and this little technique get popular in the 16th century and the 17th century to disguise hidden meaning where you could flip the image and see it from one little point of view like this but this be early incorporation of illusion bring to sort of high point with Hans Holbein Ambassadors and Hans Holbein work for Henry VIII this be hang on a wall where you could walk down from the stair and you can see this hidden skull all right now I be go to show you some designer who work with illusion to give that element of surprise one of my favorite be Scott Kim I work with Scott to create some illusion for TED that I hope you will enjoy we have one here on TED and happiness ok now Arthur Ganson have not talk yet but he be go to be a delightful talk and he have some of he really fantastic machine outside and so we Scott create this wonderful tribute to Arthur Ganson well there be analog and digital thought that be appropriate here and figure go to ground and for the musician and of course since happiness we want joy to the world now another great designer he be very well know in Japan Shigeo Fukuda and he just build some fantastic thing this be simply amazing this be a pile of junk that when you view it from one particular angle you see its reflection in the mirror as a perfect piano pianist transform to violinist this be really wild this assemblage of fork knife and spoon and various cutlery weld together it give a shadow of a motorcycle you learn something in the sort of thing that I do which be there be person out there with a lot of time on they hand Ken Knowlton do wonderful composite image like create Jacques Cousteau out of seashell un retouch seashell but just by rearrange they he do Einstein out of dice because after all Einstein say God do not play dice with the universe Bert Herzog out of un retouch keyboard will Shortz crossword puzzle John Cederquist do this wonderful trompe l oeil cabinet now I be go to skip ahead since I be sort of run behind I want to show you quickly what I have create some new type of illusion I have do something with take the Pixar type illusion so you see this kid the same size here run down the hall the two table top of the same size they be look out two direction at once you have a large piece fit in with a small and that be something for you to think about all right so you see large piece fit in within small piece here do everyone see that which be impossible you can see the two kid be look out simultaneously out of two different direction at once now can you believe this two table top be the same size and shape they be so if you measure they they would be and as I say that two figure be identical in size and shape and it be interesting by do this in this sort of render fashion how much strong the illusion be any case I hope this have bring you a little joy and happiness and if you be interested in see more cool effect see I outside I would be happy to show you lot of thing
