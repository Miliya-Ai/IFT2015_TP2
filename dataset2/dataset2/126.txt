it be very very difficult to speak at the end of a conference like this because everyone have speak everything have be say so I think that what may be useful be to remind we of some of the thing that have go on here and then maybe offer some idea which we can take away and take forward and work on that be what I would like to try and do we come here say we want to talk about Africa the Next chapter but we be talk about Africa the Next chapter because we be look at the old and the present chapter that we be look at and say it be not such a good thing the picture I show you before and this picture of drought death and disease be what we usually see what we want to look at be Africa the Next chapter and that be this a healthy smile beautiful African and I think it be worth remember what we have hear through the conference right from the first day where I hear that all the important statistics have be give about where we be now about how the continent be do much good and the importance of that be that we have a platform to build on so I be not go to spend too much time just to show you refresh you memory that we be here for Africa the Next chapter because for the first time there really be a platform to build on we really do have it go right that the continent be grow at rate that person have think would not happen after decade of 2 percent we be now at 5 percent and it be go to project 6 and 7 percent even and inflation have come down external debt something that I can tell you a long story about because I personally work on one of the big debt on the continent have come down dramatically you know as you can see from almost 50 billion down to about 12 or 13 billion now this be a huge achievement you know we have build up reserve why be that important it be because it show off we economy show off we currency and give a platform on which person can plan and build include business we have also see some evidence that all this be make a difference because private investment flow have increase I want to remind you again I know you see this statistics before from almost 6 billion we be now at about 18 billion in 2005 remittance I just take one country Nigeria skyrocket skyrocket be too dramatic but increase dramatically and in many other country this be happen why be this important because it show confidence person be now confident to bring if you person in the diaspora bring they money back it show other person that look there be emerge confidence in you country and instead of a outflow you be now get a net inflow now why be all this important to have to go really fast it be important that we build this platform that we have the president Kikwete and other of we leader who be say look we must do something different because we be confront with a challenge 62 percent of we population be below the age of 24 what do this mean this mean that we have to focus on how we youth be go to be engage in productive endeavor in they life you have to focus on how to create job make sure they do not fall into disease and that they get a education but most of all that they be productively engage in life and that they be create the kind of productive environment in we country that will make thing happen and to support this I just recently one of the thing I have do since leave government be to start a opinion research organization in Nigeria Most of we country do not even have any opinion research person do not have voice there be no way you can know what person want one of the thing we ask they recently be what be they top issue like in every other country where this have be do job be the top issue I want to leave this up here and come back to it but before I get to this slide I just want to run you through this and to say that for I the next stage of build this platform that now enable we to move forward and we must not make light of it it be only 5 6 7 year ago we could not even talk about the next chapter because we be in the old chapter we be go nowhere the economy be not grow we be have negative per capita growth the microeconomic framework and foundation for move forward be not even there so let not forget that it be take a lot to build this include all that thing that we try to do in Nigeria that Dele refer to create we own program to solve problem like fight corruption building institution stabilize the micro economy so now we have this platform we can build on and it bring we to the debate that have be go on here aid versus private sector aid versus trade etc and someone stand up to say that one of the frustrating thing be that it be be a simplistic debate and that be not what the debate should be about that be engage in the wrong debate the issue here be how do we get a partnership that involve government donor the private sector and ordinary African person take charge of they own life how do we combine all this to move we continent forward to do the thing that need do that I talk about get young person employ get the creative juice flow on this continent much of what you have see here so I be afraid we have be engage a little bit in the wrong debate we need to bring it back to say what be the combination of all this factor that be go to yield what we want applause and I want to tell you something for I the issue about aid I do not think that African need to now go all the way over to the other side and feel bad about aid Africa have be give the other country aid Mo Ibrahim say at a debate we be at that he dream one day when Africa will be give aid and I say Mo you be right we have no but we have already be do it the U K and the U S could not have be build today without Africa aid applause it be all the resource that be take from Africa include human that build this country today so when they try to give back we should not be on the defensive the issue be not that the issue be how be we use what have be give back how be we use it be it be direct effectively I want to tell you a little story why I do not mind if we get aid but we use it well from 1967 to 70 Nigeria fight a war the Nigeria Biafra war and in the middle of that war I be 14 year old we spend much of we time with my mother cook for the army my father join the army as a brigadier the biafran army we be on the biafran side and we be down to eat one meal a day run from place to place but wherever we could help we do at a certain point in time in 1969 thing be really bad we be down to almost nothing in term of a meal a day person child be die of kwashiorkor I be sure some of you who be not so young will remember that picture well I be in the middle of it in the midst of all this my mother fall ill with a stomach ailment for two or three day we think she be go to die my father be not there he be in the army so I be the old person in the house my sister fall very ill with malaria she be three year old and I be 15 and she have such a high fever we try everything it do not look like it be go to work until we hear that 10 kilometer away there be a doctor who be look at person and give they med now I put my sister on my back burn and I walk 10 kilometer with she strap on my back it be really hot I be very hungry I be scared because I know she life depend on my get to this woman we hear there be a woman doctor who be treat person I walk 10 kilometer put one foot in front of the other I get there and I see huge crowd almost a thousand person be there try to break down the door she be do this in a church how be I go to get in I have to crawl in between the leg of this person with my sister strap on my back find a way to a window and while they be try to break down the door I climb in through the window and jump in this woman tell I it be in the nick of time by the time we jump into that hall she be barely move she give a shot of she chloroquine what I learn be the chloroquine then give she some it must have be a re hydration and some other therapy and put we in a corner in about two to three hour she start to move and then they towel she down because she start sweat which be a good sign and then my sister wake up and about five or six hour later she say we could go home I strap she on my back I walk the 10 kilometer back and it be the short walk I ever have I be so happy applause that my sister be alive today she be 41 year old a mother of three and she be a physician save other life why be I tell that I be tell you that because when it be you or you person involve you do not care where whether it be aid you do not care what it be applause you just want the person to be alive and now let I become less sentimental and say that save life which some of the aid we get do on this continent when you save the life of anyone a farmer a teacher a mother they be contribute productively into the economy and as a economist we can also look at that side of the story this be person who be productive agent in the economy so if we save person from HIV AIDS if we save they from malaria it mean they can form the base of production for we economy and by the same token as someone say yesterday if we do not and they die they child will become a burden on the economy so even from a economic standpoint if we leave the social and the humanitarian we need to save life now so that be one of the reason from a personal experience that I say let channel this resource we get into something productive however I will also tell you that I be one of that who do not believe that this be the sole answer that be why I say the debate have to get more sophisticated you know we have to use it well what have happen in Europe do you all know that Spain part of the EU get 10 billion dollar in aid from the rest of the EU Resources that be transfer to they and be the Spanish ashamed of this no the EU transfer 10 billion where do they use it have you be to southern Spain lately there be road everywhere infrastructure everywhere it be on the back of this that the whole of southern Spain have develop into a service economy do you know that Ireland get 3 billion dollar in aid Ireland be one of the fast grow economy in the European Union today for which many person even from other part of the world be go there to find job what do they do with the 3 billion dollar in aid they use it to build a information superhighway gain infrastructure that enable they to participate in the information technology revolution and to create job in they economy they do not say no you know we be not go to take this today the European Union be busy transfer aid my frustration be if they can build infrastructure in Spain which be road highway other thing that they can build I say then why do they refuse to use the same aid to build the same infrastructure in we country applause when we ask they and tell they what we need one of my worry today be that we have many foundation now now we talk about the World Bank IMF and accountability all that and the EU we also have private citizen now who have a lot of money some of they in this audience with private foundation and one day this foundation have so much money they will overtake the official aid that be be give but I fear and I be very grateful to all of they for what they be try to do on the continent but I be also worried I wake up with a gnaw in my belly because I see a new set of aid entrepreneur on the continent and they be also go from country to country and many time try to find what to do but I be not really sure that they assistance be also be channel in the right way and many of they be not really familiar with the continent they be just discover and many time I do not see African work with they they be just go alone applause and many time I get the impression that they be not really even interested in hear from African who might know they want to visit we see what be happen on the ground and make a decision and now I be maybe be harsh but I worry because this money be so important now who be they accountable to be we on they board when they make decision about where to channel money be we there will we make the same mistake that we make before have we president and we leader everyone be talk about have they ever call this person together and say look you foundation and you foundation you have so much money we be grateful let sit down and really tell you where the money should be channel and where this aid should go have we do that the answer be no and each one be make they own individual effort and then 10 year from now billion will again have go into Africa and we would still have the same problem this be what give we the hopeless image we inability to take charge and say to all this person bring they money sit down and we do not do it because there be so many of we we do not coordinate we have not call the Bill Gates and the Soros and everybody else who be help and say sit down let have a conference with you as a continent here be we priority here be where we want you to channel this money each one should not be a entrepreneur go out and find what be good we be not try to stop they at all but to help they help we good and what be disappoint I be that we be not do this ten year from now we will have the same story and we will be repeat the same thing so we problem right now be how can we leverage all this good will that be come towards we way how can we get government to combine properly with this private foundation with the international organization and with we private sector I firmly believe in that private sector thing too but it can not do it alone so there might be a few idea we could think of that could work they say this be about proliferate and share idea so why do not we think of use some of this aid well why do not we first say to that help we out do not be shy about infrastructure that health that you be work on can not be sustainable without infrastructure that education will work good if we have get electricity and railroad and so on that agriculture will work good if there be railroad to get the goods to market do not be shy of it Invest some of you resource in that too and then we can see that this be one combination of private international multilateral money private sector and the African that we can put together as a partnership so that aid can be a facilitator that be all aid can be Aid can not solve we problem I be firmly convince about that but it can be catalytic and if we fail to use it as catalytic we would have fail one of the reason why China be a bit popular with African now one of the reason be not only just that you know this person be stupid and China be come to take resource it be because there be a little more leverage in term of the Chinese if you tell they we need a road here they will help you build it they do not shy away from infrastructure in fact the Chinese minister of finance say to I when I ask he what be we do wrong in Nigeria he say there be two thing you need only infrastructure infrastructure infrastructure and discipline you be undisciplined applause and I repeat it for the continent it be the same we need infrastructure infrastructure and discipline so we can make a catalytic to help we provide some of that now I realize I be not say health and education no you can also provide that as well but I be say it be not either or let see how aid can be a facilitator in partnership one idea second thing for the private sector person be afraid to take risk on the continent why can not some of this aid be use as a kind of guarantee mechanism to enable person to take risk applause and finally because they be both stand at my i be out of time be I out of time ok so let I not forget my punchline one of the thing I want everybody to collaborate on be to support woman to create job applause a lot have be say here about woman I do not need to repeat it but there be person woman create job and we know study have show that when you put resource in the hand of the woman in fact there be a econometric study the World Bank Review do in 2000 show that transfer into the hand of woman result in healthy child more for the household more for the economy and all that so I be say that one of the takeaway from here I be not say the man be not important obviously if you leave the husband out what will they do they will come back home and get disgruntle and it will result in difficulty we do not want we do not want man beat they wife because they do not have a job and so on but at the margin we also I want to push this because the reason be the man automatically they get not automatically but they tend to get more support but I want you to realize that resource in the hand of African woman be a powerful tool there be person create job Beatrice Gakuba have create 200 job from she flower business in Rwanda we have Ibukun Awosika in Nigeria with the chair company she want to expand she need another 20 million she will create another 100 200 more job so take away from here be how be you go to put together the resource to put money in the hand of woman in the middle who be ready business person who want to expand and create more job and lastly what be you go to do to be part of this partnership of aid government private sector and the African as a individual thank you applause
