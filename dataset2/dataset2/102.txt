the immersive ugliness of we everyday environment in America be entropy make visible we can not overestimate the amount of despair that we be generate with place like this and mostly I want to persuade you that we have to do good if we be go to continue the project of civilization in America by the way this do not help nobody have a good day down here because of that there be a lot of way you can describe this you know I like to call it the national automobile slum you can call it suburban sprawl I think it be appropriate to call it the great misallocation of resource in the history of the world you can call it a technosis externality clusterfuck and it be a tremendous problem for we the outstanding the salient problem about this for we be that this be place that be not worth care about we be go to talk about that some more a sense of place you ability to create place that be meaningful and place of quality and character depend entirely on you ability to define space with building and to employ the vocabulary grammar syntax rhythm and pattern of architecture in order to inform we who we be the public realm in America have two role it be the dwell place of we civilization and we civic life and it be the physical manifestation of the common good and when you degrade the public realm you will automatically degrade the quality of you civic life and the character of all the enactment of you public life and communal life that take place there the public realm come mostly in the form of the street in America because we do not have the 1 000 year old cathedral plaza and market square of old culture and you ability to define space and to create place that be worth care about all come from a body of culture that we call the culture of civic design this be a body of knowledge method skill and principle that we throw in the garbage after World War II and decide we do not need that anymore we be not go to use it and consequently we can see the result all around we the public realm have to inform we not only where we be geographically but it have to inform we where we be in we culture where we have come from what kind of person we be and it need to by do that it need to afford we a glimpse to where we be go in order to allow we to dwell in a hopeful present and if there be one tremendous if there be one great catastrophe about the place that we have build the human environment we have make for ourselves in the last 50 year it be that it have deprive we of the ability to live in a hopeful present the environment we be live in more typically be like this you know this happen to be the asteroid belt of architectural garbage two mile north of my town and remember to create a place of character and quality you have to be able to define space so how be that be accomplish here if you stand on the apron of the Wal Mart over here and try to look at the target store over here you can not see it because of the curvature of the earth laughter that be nature way of tell you that you be do a poor job of define space consequently this will be place that nobody want to be in this will be place that be not worth care about we have about you know 38 000 place that be not worth care about in the United States today when we have enough of they we be go to have a nation that be not worth defend and I want you to think about that when you think about that young man and woman who be over in place like Iraq spill they blood in the sand and ask yourself what be they last thought of home I hope it be not the curb cut between the Chuck e cheese and the target store because that be not good enough for American to be spill they blood for applause we need good place in this country public space this be a good public space it be a place worth care about it be well define it be emphatically a outdoor public room it have something that be terribly important it have what be call a active and permeable membrane around the edge that be a fancy way of say it be get shop bar bistro destination thing go in and out of it it be permeable the beer go in and out the waitress go in and out and that activate the center of this place and make it a place that person want to hang out in you know in this place in other culture person just go there voluntarily because they like they we do not have to have a craft fair here to get person to come here laughter you know you do not have to have a Kwanzaa festival person just go because it be pleasurable to be there but this be how we do it in the United States probably the most significant public space failure in America design by the lead architect of the day Harry Cobb and I M Pei Boston City Hall Plaza a public place so dismal that the wino do not even want to go there laughter and we can not fix it because I M Pei still alive and every year Harvard and M I t have a joint committee to repair it and every year they fail to because they do not want to hurt I M Pei feel this be the other side of the building this be the winner of a international design award in I think 1966 something like that it be not Pei and Cobb another firm design this but there be not enough Prozac in the world to make person feel ok about go down this block this be the back of Boston City Hall the most important you know significant civic building in Albany excuse I in Boston and what be the message that be come what be the vocabulary and grammar that be come from this building and how be it inform we about who we be this in fact would be a good building if we put Mosaic portrait of Josef Stalin Pol Pot Saddam Hussein and all the other great despot of the 20th century on the side of the building because then we have honestly be say what the building be really communicate to we you know that it be a despotic building it want we to feel like termite laughter this be it on a small scale the back of the civic center in my town Saratoga Springs New York by the way when I show this slide to a group of Kiwanians in my town they all rise in indignation from they cream chicken laughter and they shout at I and say it be rain that day when you take that picture because this be perceive to be a weather problem laughter you know this be a building design like a dvd player laughter Audio jack power supply and look you know this thing be important architectural job for firm right you know we hire firm to design this thing you can see exactly what go on three o clock in the morning at the design meeting you know eight hour before deadline four architect try to get this building in on time right and they be sit there at the long boardroom table with all the drawing and the rendering and all the Chinese food casket be lie on the table and I mean what be the conversation that be go on there laughter because you know what the last word be what the last sentence be of that meeting it be fuck it laughter applause that that be the message of this form of architecture the message be we do not give a fuck we do not give a fuck so I go back on the nice day of the year just to you know do some reality testing and in fact he will not even go down there because laughter it be not interesting enough for he client you know the burglar the mugger it be not civically rich enough for they to go down there ok the pattern of Main Street USA in fact this pattern of building downtown block all over the world be fairly universal it be not that complicated building more than one story high build out to the sidewalk edge so that person who be you know all kind of person can get into the building other activity be allow to occur upstairs you know apartment office and so on you make provision for this activity call shopping on the ground floor they have not learn that in Monterey if you go out to the corner right at the main intersection right in front of this conference center you will see a intersection with four blank wall on every corner it be really incredible anyway this be how you compose and assemble a downtown business building and this be what happen when in Glens Falls New York when we try to do it again where it be miss right so the first thing they do be they pop up the retail a half a story above grade to make it sporty ok that completely destroy the relationship between the business and the sidewalk where the theoretical pedestrian be laughter of course they will never be there as long as this be in that condition then because the relationship between the retail be destroy we pop a handicapped ramp on that and then to make ourselves feel well we put a nature Band Aid in front of it and that be how we do it I call they nature Band Aids because there be a general idea in America that the remedy for mutilate urbanism be nature and in fact the remedy for wound and mutilate urbanism be good urbanism good building not just flower bed not just cartoon of the Sierra Nevada Mountains you know that be not good enough we have to do good build the street tree have really four job to do and that be it to spatially denote the pedestrian realm to protect the pedestrian from the vehicle in the carriageway to filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk and to soften the hardscape of the building and to create a ceiling a vault ceiling over the street at its good and that be it that be the four job of the street tree they be not suppose to be a cartoon of the North Woods they be not suppose to be a set for the last of the Mohicans you know one of the problem with the fiasco of suburbia be that it destroy we understanding of the distinction between the country and the town between the urban and the rural they be not the same thing and we be not go to cure the problem of the urban by drag the country into the city which be what a lot of we be try to do all the time here you see it on a small scale the mothership have land r2 d2 and c 3po have step out to test the bark mulch to see if they can inhabit this planet laughter a lot of this come from the fact that the industrial city in America be such a trauma that we develop this tremendous aversion for the whole idea of the city city life and everything connect with it and so what you see fairly early in the mid 19th century be this idea that we now have to have a antidote to the industrial city which be go to be life in the country for everybody and that start to be deliver in the form of the railroad suburb the country villa along the railroad line which allow person to enjoy the amenity of the city but to return to the countryside every night and believe I there be no Wal Marts or convenience store out there then so it really be a form of country live but what happen be of course it mutate over the next 80 year and it turn into something rather insidious it become a cartoon of a country house in a cartoon of the country and that be the great non articulate agony of suburbia and one of the reason that it lend itself to ridicule because it have not deliver what it be be promise for half a century now and this be typically the kind of dwell we find there you know basically a house with nothing on the side because this house want to state emphatically I be a little cabin in the wood there be nothing on either side of I I do not have any eye on the side of my head I can not see so you have this one last facade of the house the front which be really a cartoon of a facade of a house because notice the porch here unless the person that live here be munchkin nobody be go to be use that this be really in fact a television broadcast a show 24 7 call we be normal we be normal we be normal we be normal we be normal we be normal please respect we we be normal we be normal we be normal but we know what be go on in this house you know we know that little Skippy be load he Uzi down here get ready for homeroom laughter we know that Heather he sister Heather 14 year old be turn trick up here to support she drug habit because this place this habitat be induce immense amount of anxiety and depression in child and they do not have a lot of experience with medication so they take the first one that come along often this be not good enough for American this be the school we be send they to the Hannibal Lecter Central School Las Vegas Nevada this be a real school you know but there be obviously a notion that if you let the inmate of this thing out that they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat he liver so every effort be make to keep they within the building notice that nature be present laughter we be go to have to change this behavior whether we like it or not we be enter a epochal period of change in the world and certainly in America the period that will be characterize by the end of the cheap oil era it be go to change absolutely everything Chris ask I not to go on too long about this and I will not except to say there be not go to be a hydrogen economy forget it it be not go to happen we be go to have to do something else instead we be go to have to down scale re scale and re size virtually everything we do in this country and we can not start soon enough to do it we be go to have applause we be go to have to live close to where we work we be go to have to live close to each other we be go have to grow more food close to where we live the age of the 3 000 mile Caesar salad be come to a end we be go to have to we have a railroad system that the Bulgarian would be ashamed of we get ta do good than that and we should have start two day before yesterday we be fortunate that the new urbanist be there for the last 10 year excavate all that information that be throw in the garbage by we parent generation after World War II because we be go to need it if we be go to learn how to reconstruct town we be go to need to get back this body of methodology and principle and skill in order to be learn how to compose meaningful place place that be integral that allow that be live organism in the sense that they contain all the organ of we civic life and we communal life deploy in a integral fashion so that you know the residence make sense deploy in relation to the place of business of culture and of governance we be go to have to be learn what the building block of this thing be the street the block how to compose public space that be both large and small the courtyard the civic square and how to really make use of this property we can see some of the first idea for retro fit some of the catastrophic property that we have in America the dead mall what be we go to do with they well in point of fact most of they be not go to make it they be not go to be retro fit they be go to be the salvage yard of the future some of they we be go to fix though and we be go to fix they by impose back on they street and block system and return to the building lot as the normal increment of development and if we be lucky the result will be revivify town center and neighborhood center in we exist town and city and by the way we town and city be where they be and grow where they be because they occupy all the important site and most of they be still go to be there although the scale of they be probably go to be diminish we have get a lot of work to do we be not go to be rescue by the hyper car we be not go to be rescue by alternative fuel no amount or combination of alternative fuel be go to allow we to continue run what we be run the way we be run it we be go to have to do everything very differently and America be not prepare we be sleepwalk into the future we be not ready for what be come at we so I urge you all to do what you can Life in the mid 21st century be go to be about live locally be prepare to be good neighbor be prepare to find vocation that make you useful to you neighbor and to you fellow citizen one final thing I have be very disturbed about this for year but I think it be particularly important for this audience please please stop refer to yourselve as consumer ok consumer be different than citizen consumer do not have obligation responsibility and duty to they fellow human being and as long as you be use that word consumer in the public discussion you will be degrading the quality of the discussion we be have and we be go to continue be clueless go into this very difficult future that we face so thank you very much please go out and do what you can to make this a land full of place that be worth care about and a nation that will be worth defend applause
