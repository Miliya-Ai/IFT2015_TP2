my work be about the behavior that we all engage in unconsciously on a collective level and what I mean by that it be the behavior that we be in denial about and the one that operate below the surface of we daily awareness and as individual we all do this thing all the time everyday it be like when you be mean to you wife because you be mad at somebody else or when you drink a little too much at a party just out of anxiety or when you overeat because you feeling be hurt or whatever and when we do this kind of thing when 300 million person do unconscious behavior then it can add up to a catastrophic consequence that nobody want and no one intend and that be what I look at with my photographic work this be a image I just recently complete that be when you stand back at a distance it look like some kind of neo Gothic cartoon image of a factory spew out pollution and as you get a little bit close it start look like lot of pipe like maybe a chemical plant or a refinery or maybe a hellish freeway interchange and as you get all the way up close you realize that it be actually make of lot and lot of plastic cup and in fact this be one million plastic cup which be the number of plastic cup that be use on airline flight in the United States every six hour we use four million cup a day on airline flight and virtually none of they be reuse or recycle they just do not do that in that industry now that number be dwarf by the number of paper cup we use every day and that be 40 million cup a day for hot beverage most of which be coffee I could not fit 40 million cup on a canvas but I be able to put 410 000 that be what 410 000 cup look like that be 15 minute of we cup consumption and if you could actually stack up that many cup in real life that be the size it would be and there be a hour worth of we cup and there be a day worth of we cup you can still see the little person way down there that be as high as a 42 story building and I put the Statue of Liberty in there as a scale reference speak of justice there be another phenomenon go on in we culture that I find deeply troubling and that be that America right now have the large percentage of its population in prison of any country on Earth one out of four person one out of four human in prison be American imprison in we country and I want to show the number the number be 2 3 million American be incarcerate in 2005 and that be go up since then but we do not have the number yet so I want to show 2 3 million prison uniform and in the actual print of this piece each uniform be the size of a nickel on its edge they be tiny they be barely visible as a piece of material and to show 2 3 million of they require a canvas that be large than any printer in the world would print and so I have to divide it up into multiple panel that be 10 foot tall by 25 foot wide this be that piece install in a gallery in New York that be my parent look at the piece laughter every time I look at this piece I always wonder if my mom whisper to my dad he finally fold he laundry laughter I want to show you some piece now that be about addiction and this particular one be about cigarette addiction I want to make a piece that show the actual number of American who die from cigarette smoking more than 400 000 person die in the United States every year from smoke cigarette and so this piece be make up of lot and lot of box of cigarette and as you slowly step back you see that it be a painting by Van Gogh call Skull with cigarette it be a strange thing to think about that on 9 11 when that tragedy happen 3 000 American die and do you remember the response it reverberate around the world and will continue to reverberate through time it will be something that we talk about in 100 year and yet on that same day 1 100 American die from smoke and the day after that another 1 100 American die from smoke and every single day since then 1 100 American have die and today 1 100 American be die from cigarette smoking and we be not talk about it we dismiss it the tobacco lobby it be too strong we just dismiss it out of we consciousness and know what we know about the destructive power of cigarette we continue to allow we child we son and daughter to be in the presence of the influence that start they smoke and this be what the next piece be about this be just lot and lot of cigarette 65 000 cigarette which be equal to the number of teenager who will start smoke this month and every month in the U S more than 700 000 child in the United States aged 18 and under begin smoke every year one more strange epidemic in the United States that I want to acquaint you with be this phenomenon of abuse and misuse of prescription drug this be a image I have make out of lot and lot of Vicodin well actually I only have one vicodin that I scan lot and lot of time laughter and so as you stand back you see 213 000 vicodin pill which be the number of hospital emergency room visit yearly in the United States attributable to abuse and misuse of prescription painkiller and anti anxiety medication one third of all drug overdose in the U S and that include cocaine heroin alcohol everything one third of drug overdose be prescription medication a strange phenomenon this be a piece that I just recently complete about another tragic phenomenon and that be the phenomenon this grow obsession we have with breast augmentation surgery 384 000 woman American woman last year go in for elective breast augmentation surgery it be rapidly become the most popular high school graduation gift give to young girl who be about to go off to college so I make this image out of Barbie doll and so as you stand back you see this kind of floral pattern and as you get all the way back you see 32 000 Barbie doll which represent the number of breast augmentation surgery that be perform in the U S each month the vast majority of that be on woman under the age of 21 and strangely enough the only plastic surgery that be more popular than breast augmentation be liposuction and most of that be be do by man now I want to emphasize that this be just example I be not hold this out as be the big issue they be just example and the reason that I do this it be because I have this fear that we be not feel enough as a culture right now there be this kind of anesthesia in America at the moment we have lose we sense of outrage we anger and we grief about what be go on in we culture right now what be go on in we country the atrocity that be be commit in we name around the world they have go miss this feeling have go missing we cultural joy we national joy be nowhere to be see and one of the cause of this I think be that as each of we attempt to build this new kind of worldview this holoptical worldview this holographic image that we be all try to create in we mind of the interconnection of thing the environmental footprint 1 000 mile away of the thing that we buy the social consequence 10 000 mile away of the daily decision that we make as consumer as we try to build this view and try to educate ourselves about the enormity of we culture the information that we have to work with be this gigantic number number in the million in the hundred of million in the billion and now in the trillion Bush new budget be in the trillion and this be number that we brain just do not have the ability to comprehend we can not make mean out of this enormous statistics and so that be what I be try to do with my work be to take this number this statistics from the raw language of datum and to translate they into a more universal visual language that can be feel because my belief be if we can feel this issue if we can feel this thing more deeply then they will matter to we more than they do now and if we can find that then we will be able to find within each one of we what it be that we need to find to face the big question which be how do we change that to I be the big question that we face as a person right now how do we change how do we change as a culture and how do we each individually take responsibility for the one piece of the solution that we be in charge of and that be we own behavior my belief be that you do not have to make yourself bad to look at this issue I be not point the finger at America in a blame way I be simply say this be who we be right now and if there be thing that we see that we do not like about we culture then we have a choice the degree of integrity that each of we can bring to the surface to bring to this question the depth of character that we can summon as we show up for the question of how do we change it be already define we as individual and as a nation and it will continue to do that on into the future and it will profoundly affect the well be the quality of life of the billion of person who be go to inherit the result of we decision I be not speak abstractly about this I be speak this be who we be in this room right now in this moment thank you and good afternoon applause
