I think I would think about change you perspective on the world a bit and show you some of the design that we have in nature and so I have my first slide to talk about the dawn of the universe and what I call the cosmic scene investigation that be look at the relic of creation and infer what happen at the beginning and then follow it up and try to understand it and so one of the question that I ask you be when you look around what do you see well you see this space that be create by designer and by the work of person but what you actually see be a lot of material that be already here be reshape in a certain form and so the question be how do that material get here how do it get into the form that it have before it get reshape and so forth it be a question of what be the continuity so one of the thing I look at be how do the universe begin and shape what be the whole process in the creation and the evolution of the universe to get to the point that we have this kind of material so that be sort of the part and let I move on then and show you the Hubble Ultra Deep Field if you look at this picture what you will see be a lot of dark with some light object in it and everything but four of this light object be star and you can see they there little plus this be a star this be a star everything else be a galaxy ok so there be a couple of thousand galaxy you can see easily with you eye in here and when I look out at particularly this galaxy which look a lot like ours I wonder if there be a art design college conference go on and intelligent be there be think about you know what design they might do and there might be a few cosmologist try to understand where the universe itself come from and there might even be some in that galaxy look at ours try to figure out what be go on over here but there be a lot of other galaxy and some be nearby and they be kind of the color of the Sun and some be further away and they be a little blue and so forth but one of the question be this should be to you how come there be so many galaxy because this represent a very clean fraction of the sky this be only 1 000 galaxy we think there be on the order visible to the Hubble Space Telescope if you have the time to scan it around about 100 billion galaxy right it be a very large number of galaxy and that be roughly how many star there be in we own galaxy but when you look at some of this region like this you will see more galaxy than star which be kind of a conundrum so the question should come to you mind be what kind of design you know what kind of creative process and what kind of design produce the world like that and then I be go to show you it be actually a lot more complicated we be go to try and follow it up we have a tool that actually help we out in this study and that be the fact that the universe be so incredibly big that it be a time machine in a certain sense we draw this set of nest sphere cut away so you see it put the Earth at the center of the nest sphere just because that be where we be make observation and the moon be only two second away so if you take a picture of the moon use ordinary light it be the moon two second ago and who care two second be like the present the Sun be eight minute ago that be not such a big deal right unless there be solar flare come then you want to get out the way you would like to have a little advance warn but you get out to Jupiter and it be 40 minute away it be a problem you hear about Mars it be a problem communicate to Mars because it take light long enough to go there but if you look out to the near set of star to the near 40 or 50 star it be about 10 year so if you take a picture of what be go on it be 10 year ago but you go and look to the center of the galaxy it be thousand of year ago if you look at Andromeda which be the near big galaxy and it be two million year ago if you take a picture of the Earth two million year ago there would be no evidence of human at all because we do not think there be human yet I mean it just give you the scale with the Hubble Space Telescope we be look at hundred of million of year to a billion year but if we be capable to come up with a idea of how to look even further there be some thing even far and that be what I do in a lot of my work be to develop the technique we could look out back to even early epoch before there be star and before there be galaxy back to when the universe be hot and dense and very different and so that be the sort of sequence and so I have a more artistic impression of this there be the galaxy in the middle which be the Milky Way and around that be the Hubble you know nearby kind of galaxy and there be a sphere that mark the different time and behind that be some more modern galaxy you see the whole big picture the beginning of time be funny it be on the outside right and then there be a part of the universe we can not see because it be so dense and so hot light can not escape it be like you can not see to the center of the Sun you have to use other technique to know what be go on inside the Sun but you can see the edge of the Sun and the universe get that way and you can see that and then you see this sort of model area around the outside and that be the radiation come from the Big Bang which be actually incredibly uniform the universe be almost a perfect sphere but there be this very tiny variation which we show here in great exaggeration and from they in the time sequence we be go to have to go from this tiny variation to this irregular galaxy and first star to this more advanced galaxy and eventually the solar system and so forth so it be a big design job but we will see about how thing be go on so the way this measurement be do there be be a set of satellite and this be where you get to see so there be the COBE satellite which be launch in 1989 and we discover this variation and then in 2000 the map satellite be launch the WMAP and it make somewhat good picture and later this year this be the cool stealth version the one that actually have some beautiful design feature to it and you should look the Planck satellite will be launch and it will make very high resolution map and that will be the sequence of understand the very beginning of the universe and what we see be we see this variation and then they tell we the secret both about the structure of space time and about the contents of the universe and about how the universe start in its original motion so we have this picture which be quite a spectacular picture and I will come back to the beginning where we be go to have some mysterious process that kick the universe off at the beginning and we go through a period of accelerate expansion and the universe expand and cool until it get to the point where it become transparent then to the Dark Ages and then the first star turn on and they evolve into galaxy and then later they get to the more expansive galaxy and somewhere around this period be when we solar system start form and it be mature up to the present time and there be some spectacular thing and this wastebasket part that be to represent what the structure of space time itself be do during this period and so this be a pretty weird model right what kind of evidence do we have for that so let I show you some of nature pattern that be the result of this I always think of space time as be the real substance of space and the galaxy and the star just like the foam on the ocean it be a marker of where the interesting wave be and whatever go on so here be the Sloan Digital Sky Survey show the location of a million galaxy so there be a dot on here for every galaxy they go out and point a telescope at the sky take a picture identify what be star and throw they away look at the galaxy estimate how far away they be and plot they up and just put radially they be go out that way and you see this structure this thing we call the Great Wall but there be voids and that kind of stuff and they kind of fade out because the telescope be not sensitive enough to do it now I be go to show you this in 3d what happen be you take picture as the Earth rotate you get a fan across the sky there be some place you can not look because of we own galaxy or because there be no telescope available to do it so the next picture show you the three dimensional version of this rotate around do you see the fan like scan make across the sky remember every spot on here be a galaxy and you see the galaxy you know sort of in we neighborhood and you sort of see the structure and you see this thing we call the Great Wall and you see the complicated structure and you see this voids there be place where there be no galaxy and there be place where there be thousand of galaxy clump together right so there be a interesting pattern but we do not have enough datum here to actually see the pattern we only have a million galaxy right so we be keep like a million ball in the air but what be go on there be another survey which be very similar to this call the two degree field of View Galaxy Redshift Survey now we be go to fly through it at warp a million and every time there be a galaxy at its location there be a galaxy and if we know anything about the galaxy which we do because there be a redshift measurement and everything you put in the type of galaxy and the color so this be the real representation and when you be in the middle of the galaxy it be hard to see the pattern it be like be in the middle of life it be hard to see the pattern in the middle of the audience it be hard to see the pattern of this so we be go to go out and swing around and look back at this and you will see first the structure of the survey and then you will start see the structure of the galaxy that we see out there so again you can see the extension of this great wall of galaxy show up here but you can see the voids you can see the complicated structure and you say well how do this happen suppose you be the cosmic designer how be you go to put galaxy out there in a pattern like that it be not just throw they out at random there be a more complicated process go on here how be you go to end up do that and so now we be in for some serious play that be we have to seriously play God not just change person life but make the universe right so if that be you responsibility how be you go to do that what be the kind of technique what be the kind of thing you be go to do so I be go to show you the result of a very large scale simulation of what we think the universe might be like use essentially some of the play principle and some of the design principle that you know human have labor so hard to pick up but apparently nature know how to do at the beginning and that be you start out with very simple ingredient and some simple rule but you have to have enough ingredient to make it complicated and then you put in some randomness some fluctuation and some randomness and realize a whole bunch of different representation so what I be go to do be show you the distribution of matter as a function of scale we be go to zoom in but this be a plot of what it be and we have to add one more thing to make the universe come out right it be call dark matter that be matter that do not interact with light the typical way that ordinary matter do the way the light shine on I or on the stage it be transparent to light but in order for you to see it we be go to make it white ok so the stuff that be in this picture that be white that be the dark matter it should be call invisible matter but the dark matter we have make visible and the stuff that be in the yellow color that be the ordinary kind of matter that be turn into star and galaxy so I will show you the next movie so this we be go to zoom in notice this pattern and pay attention to this pattern we be go to zoom in and zoom in and you will see there be all this filament and structure and voids and when a number of filament come together in a knot that make a supercluster of galaxy this one we be zoom in on be somewhere between 100 000 and a million galaxy in that small region so we live in the boony we do not live in the center of the solar system we do not live in the center of the galaxy and we galaxy be not in the center of the cluster so we be zoom in this be a region which probably have more than 100 000 on the order of a million galaxy in that region we be go to keep zoom in ok and so I forget to tell you the scale a parsec be 3 26 light year so a gigaparsec be three billion light year that be the scale so it take light three billion year to travel over that distance now we be into a distance sort of between here and here that be the distance between we and Andromeda right this little speck that you be see in here they be galaxy now we be go to zoom back out and you can see this structure that when we get very far out look very regular but it be make up of a lot of irregular variation so they be simple building block there be a very simple fluid to begin with it be get dark matter it be get ordinary matter it be get photon and it be get neutrino which do not play much role in the late part of the universe and it be just a simple fluid and it over time develop into this complicated structure and so you know when you first see this picture it do not mean quite so much to you here you be look across one percent of the volume of the visible universe and you be see billion of galaxy right and node but you realize they be not even the main structure there be a framework which be the dark matter the invisible matter that be out there that be actually hold it all together so let fly through it and you can see how much hard it be when you be in the middle of something to figure this out so here be that same end result you see a filament you see the light be the invisible matter and the yellow be the star or the galaxy show up and we be go to fly around and we will fly around and you will see occasionally a couple of filament intersect and you get a large cluster of galaxy and then we will fly in to where the very large cluster be and you can see what it look like and so from inside it do not look very complicated right it be only when you look at it at a very large scale and explore it and so forth you realize it be a very intricate complicated kind of a design right and it be grow up in some kind of way so the question be how hard would it be to assemble this right how big a contractor team would you need to put this universe together right that be the issue right and so here we be you see how the filament you see how several filament be come together therefore make this supercluster of galaxy and you have to understand this be not how it would actually look if you first you can not travel this fast everything would be distort but this be use simple rendering and graphic art kind of stuff this be how if you take billion of year to go around it might look to you right and if you could see invisible matter too and so the idea be you know how would you put together the universe in a very simple way we be go to start and realize that the entire visible universe everything we can see in every direction with the Hubble Space Telescope plus we other instrument be once in a region that be small than a atom it start with tiny quantum mechanical fluctuation but expand at a tremendous rate and that fluctuation be stretch to astronomical size and that fluctuation eventually be the thing we see in the cosmic microwave background and then we need some way to turn that fluctuation into galaxy and cluster of galaxy and make this kind of structure go on so I be go to show you a small simulation this simulation be run on 1 000 processor for a month in order to make just this simple visible one so I be go to show you one that can be run on a desktop in two day in the next picture so you start out with teeny fluctuation when the universe be at this point now four time small and so forth and you start see this network this cosmic web of structure form and this be a simple one because it do not have the ordinary matter and it just have the dark matter in it and you see how the dark matter lump up and the ordinary matter just trail along behind so there it be at the begin it be very uniform the fluctuation be a part in 100 000 there be a few peak that be a part in 10 000 and then over billion of year gravity just pull in this be light over density pull the material around in that pull in more material and pull in more material but the distance on the universe be so large and the time scale be so large that it take a long time for this to form and it keep form until the universe be roughly about half the size it be now in term of its expansion and at that point the universe mysteriously start accelerate its expansion and cut off the formation of large scale structure so we be just see as large a scale structure as we can see and then only thing that have start form already be go to form and then from then on it be go to go on so we be able to do the simulation but this be two day on a desktop we need you know 30 day on 1 000 processor to do the kind of simulation that I show you before so we have a idea of how to play seriously create the universe by start with essentially less than a eyedrop full of material and we create everything we can see in any direction right from almost nothing that be something extremely tiny extremely small and it be almost perfect except it have this tiny fluctuation at a part in 100 000 level which turn out to produce the interesting pattern and design we see that be galaxy and star and so forth so we have a model and we can calculate it and we can use it to make design of what we think the universe really look like and that design be sort of way beyond what we original imagination ever be so this be what we start with 15 year ago with the cosmic background Explorer make the map on the upper right which basically show we that there be large scale fluctuation and actually fluctuation on several scale you can kind of see that since then we have have wmap which just give we high angular resolution we see the same large scale structure but we see additional small scale structure and on the bottom right be if the satellite have flip upside down and map the Earth what kind of a map we would have get of the Earth you can see well you can kind of pick out all the major continent but that be about it but what we be hope when we get to Planck we will have resolution about equivalent to the resolution you see of the Earth there where you can really see the complicated pattern that exist on the Earth and you can also tell because of the sharp edge and the way thing fit together there be some non linear process Geology have this effect which be move the plate around and so forth you can see that just from the map alone we want to get to the point in we map of the early universe we can see whether there be any non linear effect that be start to move to modify and be give we a hint about how space time itself be actually create at the begin moment so that be where we be today and that be what I want to give you a flavor of give you a different view about what the design and what everything else look like thank you applause
