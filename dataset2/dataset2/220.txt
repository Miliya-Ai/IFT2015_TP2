I love a challenge and save the Earth be probably a good one we all know the Earth be in trouble we have now enter in the 6x the sixth major extinction on this planet I often wonder if there be a United Organization of Organisms otherwise know as uh oh laughter and every organism have a right to vote would we be vote on the planet or off the planet I think that vote be occur right now I want to present to you a suite of six mycological solution use fungus and this solution be base on mycelium the mycelium infuse all landscape it hold soil together it be extremely tenacious this hold up to 30 000 time its mass they be the grand molecular disassembler of nature the soil magician they generate the humus soil across the landmass of Earth we have now discover that there be a multi directional transfer of nutrient between plant mitigate by the mcyelium so the mycelium be the mother that be give nutrient from alder and birch tree to hemlock cedar and Douglas fir dusty and I we like to say on Sunday this be where we go to church I be in love with the old growth forest and I be a patriotic American because we have that most of you be familiar with portobello mushroom and frankly I face a big obstacle when I mention mushroom to somebody they immediately think portobello or magic mushroom they eye glaze over and they think I be a little crazy so I hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group we call it mycophobia the irrational fear of the unknown when it come to fungus mushroom be very fast in they growth day 21 day 23 day 25 mushroom produce strong antibiotic in fact we be more closely related to fungus than we be to any other kingdom a group of 20 eukaryotic microbiologist publish a paper two year ago erect opisthokonta a super kingdom that join animalium and fungus together we share in common the same pathogen fungus do not like to rot from bacterium and so we good antibiotic come from fungus but here be a mushroom that be past its prime after they sporulate they do rot but I propose to you that the sequence of microbe that occur on rot mushroom be essential for the health of the forest they give rise to the tree they create the debris field that feed the mycelium and so we see a mushroom here sporulate and the spore be germinate and the mycelium form and go underground in a single cubic inch of soil there can be more than eight mile of this cell my foot be cover approximately 300 mile of mycelium this be photomicrograph from Nick Read and Patrick Hickey and notice that as the mycelium grow it conquer territory and then it begin the net I have be a scanning electron microscopist for many year I have thousand of electron micrograph and when I be stare at the mycelium I realize that they be microfiltration membrane we exhale carbon dioxide so do mycelium it inhale oxygen just like we do but this be essentially externalize stomach and lung and I present to you a concept that this be extend neurological membrane and in this cavity this micro cavity form and as they fuse soil they absorb water this be little well and inside this well then microbial community begin to form and so the spongy soil not only resist erosion but set up a microbial universe that give rise to a plurality of other organism I first propose in the early 1990 that mycelium be Earth natural internet when you look at the mycelium they be highly branch and if there be one branch that be break then very quickly because of the node of cross internet engineer maybe call they hot point there be alternative pathway for channel nutrient and information the mycelium be sentient it know that you be there when you walk across landscape it leap up in the aftermath of you footstep try to grab debris so I believe the invention of the computer internet be a inevitable consequence of a previously prove biologically successful model the Earth invent the computer internet for its own benefit and we now be the top organism on this planet be try to allocate resource in order to protect the biosphere go way out dark matter conform to the same mycelial archetype I believe matter beget life life become single cell single cell become string string become chain chain network and this be the paradigm that we see throughout the universe most of you may not know that fungus be the first organism to come to land they come to land 1 3 billion year ago and plant follow several hundred million year later how be that possible it be possible because the mycelium produce oxalic acid and many other acid and enzyme pockmark rock and grab calcium and other mineral and form calcium oxalate make the rock crumble and the first step in the generation of soil oxalic acid be two carbon dioxide molecule join together so fungus and mycelium sequester carbon dioxide in the form of calcium oxalate and all sort of other oxalate be also sequestering carbon dioxide through the mineral that be be form and take out of the rock matrix this be first discover in 1859 this be a photograph by Franz Hueber this photograph take 1950 in Saudi Arabia 420 million year ago this organism exist it be call Prototaxites Prototaxites lay down be about three foot tall the tall plant on Earth at that time be less than two foot Dr Boyce at the University of Chicago publish a article in the Journal of Geology this past year determine that Prototaxites be a giant fungus a giant mushroom across the landscape of Earth be dot this giant mushroom all across most land mass and this exist for ten of million of year now we have have several extinction event and as we march forward 65 million year ago most of you know about it we have a asteroid impact the Earth be strike by a asteroid a huge amount of debris be jettison into the atmosphere sunlight be cut off and fungus inherit the Earth that organism that pair with fungus be reward because fungus do not need light more recently at Einstein University they just determine that fungus use radiation as a source of energy much like plant use light so the prospect of fungus exist on other planet elsewhere I think be a forgone conclusion at least in my own mind the large organism in the world be in Eastern Oregon I could not miss it it be 2 200 acre in size 2 200 acre in size 2 000 year old the large organism on the planet be a mycelial mat one cell wall thick how be it that this organism can be so large and yet be one cell wall thick whereas we have five or six skin layer that protect we the mycelium in the right condition produce a mushroom it burst through with such ferocity that it can break asphalt we be involve with several experiment I be go to show you six if I can solution for help to save the world Battelle Laboratories and I join up in Bellingham Washington there be four pile saturate with diesel and other petroleum waste one be a control pile one pile be treat with enzyme one pile be treat with bacterium and we pile we inoculate with mushroom mycelium the mycelium absorb the oil the mycelium be produce enzyme peroxidase that break carbon hydrogen bond this be the same bond that hold hydrocarbon together so the mycelium become saturated with the oil and then when we return six week later all the tarp be remove all the other pile be dead dark and stinky we come back to we pile it be cover with hundred of pound of oyster mushroom and the color change to a light form the enzyme remanufacture the hydrocarbon into carbohydrate fungal sugar some of this mushroom be very happy mushroom they be very large they be show how much nutrition that they could have obtain but something else happen which be a epiphany in my life they sporulate the spore attract insect the insect lay egg egg become larva bird then come bring in seed and we pile become a oasis of life whereas the other three pile be dead dark and stinky and the PAH the aromatic hydrocarbon go from 10 000 part per million to less than 200 in eight week the last image we do not have the entire pile be a green berm of life this be gateway species vanguard species that open the door for other biological community so I invent burlap sack bunker spawn and put the mycelium use storm blow debris you can take this burlap sack and put they downstream from a farm that be produce e coli or other waste or a factory with chemical toxin and it lead to habitat restoration so we set up a site in Mason County Washington and we have see a dramatic decrease in the amount of coliform and I will show you a graph here this be a logarithmic scale 10 to the eighth power there be more than a 100 million colony per gram and 10 to the third power be around 1 000 in 48 hour to 72 hour this three mushroom species reduce the amount of coliform bacterium 10 000 time think of the implication this be a space conservative method that use storm debris and we can guarantee that we will have storm every year so this one mushroom in particular have draw we interest over time this be my wife Dusty with a mushroom call Fomitopsis officinalis Agarikon it be a mushroom exclusive to the old growth forest that dioscoride first describe in 65 a d as a treatment against consumption this mushroom grow in Washington State Oregon northern California British Columbia now think to be extinct in Europe May not seem that large let get close this be extremely rare fungus we team and we have a team of expert that go out we go out 20 time in the old growth forest last year we find one sample to be able to get into culture preserve the genome of this fungus in the old growth forest I think be absolutely critical for human health I have be involve with the U S Defense Department BioShield program we submit over 300 sample of mushroom that be boil in hot water and mycelium harvesting this extracellular metabolite and a few year ago we receive this result we have three different strain of Agarikon mushroom that be highly active against poxvirus Dr Earl Kern who be a smallpox expert of the U S Defense Department state that any compound that have a selectivity index of two or more be active 10 or great be consider to be very active we mushroom strain be in the highly active range there be a vet press release that you can read it be vet by DOD if you Google Stamets and smallpox or you can go to NPR org and listen to a live interview so encourage by this naturally we go to flu virus and so for the first time I be show this we have three different strain of Agarikon mushroom highly active against flu virus here be the selectivity index number against pox you see 10 and 20 now against flu virus compare to the ribavirin control we have a extraordinarily high activity and we be use a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical we try it against flu a virus h1n1 h3n2 as well as flu b virus so then we try a blend and in a blend combination we try it against h5n1 and we get great than 1 000 selectivity index applause I then think that we can make the argument that we should save the old growth forest as a matter of national defense applause I become interested in entomopathogenic fungus fungus that kill insect we house be be destroy by carpenter ant so I go to the EPA homepage and they be recommend study with metarhizium species of a group of fungus that kill carpenter ant as well as termite I do something that nobody else have do I actually chase the mycelium when it stop produce spore this be spore this be in they spore I be able to morph the culture into a non sporulating form and so the industry have spend over 100 million dollar specifically on bait station to prevent termite from eat you house but the insect be not stupid and they would avoid the spore when they come close and so I morph the culture into a non sporulating form and I get my daughter Barbie doll dish I put it right where a bunch of carpenter ant be make debris field every day in my house and the ant be attract to the mycelium because there be no spore they give it to the queen one week later I have no sawdust pile whatsoever and then a delicate dance between dinner and death the mycelium be consume by the ant they become mummified and bo a mushroom pop out of they head laughter now after sporulation the spore repel so the house be no long suitable for invasion so you have a near permanent solution for reinvasion of termite and so my house come down I receive my first patent against carpenter ant termite and fire ant then we try extract and lo and behold we can steer insect to different direction this have huge implication I then receive my second patent and this be a big one it be be call a Alexander Graham Bell patent it cover over 200 000 species this be the most disruptive technology I have be tell by executive of the pesticide industry that they have ever witness this could totally revamp the pesticide industry throughout the world you could fly 100 ph d student under the umbrella of this concept because my supposition be that entomopathogenic fungus prior to sporulation attract the very insect that be otherwise repel by that spore and so I come up with a Life Box because I need a delivery system the Life Box you be go to be get a dvd of the TED conference you add soil you add water you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungus as well as spore like of the Agarikon mushroom the seed then be mother by this mycelium and then you put tree seed in here and then you end up grow potentially a old growth forest from a cardboard box I want to reinvent the delivery system and the use of cardboard around the world so they become ecological footprint if there be a YouTube like site that you could put up you could make it interactive zip code specific where person could join together and through satellite imaging system through virtual earth or Google Earth you could confirm carbon credit be be sequester by the tree that be come through Life Boxes you could take a cardboard box deliver shoe you could add water I develop this for the refugee community corn bean and squash and onion I take several container my wife say if I could do this anybody could and I end up grow a seed garden then you harvest the seed and thank you Eric Rasmussen for you help on this and then you be harvest the seed garden then you can harvest the kernel and then you just need a few kernel I add mycelium to it and then I inoculate the corncob now three corncob no other grain lot of mushroom begin to form too many withdrawal from the carbon bank and so this population will be shut down but watch what happen here the mushroom then be harvest but very importantly the mycelium have convert the cellulose into fungal sugar and so I think how could we address the energy crisis in this country and we come up with Econol Generating ethanol from cellulose use mycelium as a intermediary and you gain all the benefit that I have describe to you already but to go from cellulose to ethanol be ecologically unintelligent and I think that we need to be econologically intelligent about the generation of fuel so we build the carbon bank on the planet renew the soil this be a species that we need to join with I think engage mycelium can help save the world thank you very much applause
