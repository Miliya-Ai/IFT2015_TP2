my thing with school lunch be it be a social justice issue I be the Director of Nutrition Services for the Berkeley Unified School District I have 90 employee and 17 location 9 600 kid I be do 7 100 meal a day and I have be do it for two year try to change how we feed kid in America and that be what I want to talk to you a little bit about today this be some of my kid with a salad bar I put salad bar in all of we school when I get there everyone say it could not be do little kid could not eat off the salad bar big kid would spit in it neither happen when I take over this I try to really figure out like what my vision would be how do we really change child relationship to food and I will tell you why we need to change it but we absolutely have to change it and what I come to understand be we need to teach child the symbiotic relationship between a healthy planet healthy food and healthy kid and that if we do not do that the antithesis although we have hear otherwise be we be really go to become extinct because we be feed we child to death that be my premise we be see sick kid get sicker and sicker and the reason this be happen by and large be because of we food system and the way the government commodify food the way the government oversee we food the way the USDA put food on kid plate that be unhealthy and allow unhealthy food into school and by tacitly all of we send we kid or grandchild or niece or nephew to school and tell they to learn you know learn what be in that school and when you feed this kid bad food that be what they be learn so that be really what this be all about the way we get here be because of big agribusiness we now live in a country where most of we do not decide by and large what we eat we see big business Monsanto and DuPont who bring out Agent Orange and stain resistant carpet they control 90 percent of the commercially produce seed in we country this be 10 company control much of what be in we grocery store much of what person eat and that be really really a problem so when I start think about this issue and how I be go to change what kid eat I really start focus on what we would teach they and the very first thing be about regional food try to eat food from within we region and clearly with what be go on with fossil fuel usage or when as the fossil fuel be go away as oil hit its peak oil you know we really have to start think about whether or not we should or could be move food 1 500 mile before we eat it so we talk to kid about that and we really start to feed kid regional food and then we talk about organic food now most school district can not really afford organic food but we as a nation have to start think about consume grow and feed we child food that be not chock full of chemical we can not keep feed we kid pesticide and herbicide and antibiotic and hormone we can not keep do that you know it do not work and the result of that be kid get sick one of my big soapbox right now be antibiotic seventy percent of all antibiotic consume in America be consume in animal husbandry we be feed we kid antibiotic in beef and other animal protein every day seventy percent it be unbelievable and the result of it be we have disease we have thing like e coli that we can not fix that we can not make kid well when they get sick and you know certainly antibiotic have be over prescribe but it be a issue in the food supply one of my favorite fact be that U S agriculture use 1 2 billion pound of pesticide every year that mean every one of we and we child consume what would equal a five pound bag that bag you have at home if I have one here and rip it open and that pile I would have on the floor be what we consume and feed we child every year because of what go into we food supply because of the way we consume produce in America the USDA allow this antibiotic this hormone and this pesticide in we food supply and the USDA pay for this ad in Time magazine okay we could talk about Rachel Carson and DDT but we know it be not good for you and I and that be what the USDA allow in we food supply and that have to change you know the USDA can not be see as the be all and end all of what we feed we kid and what be allow we can not believe that they have we good interest at heart the antithesis of this whole thing be sustainable food that be what I really try and get person to understand I really try and teach it to kid I think it be the most important it be consume food in a way in which we will still have a planet in which kid will grow up to be healthy and which really try to mitigate all the negative impact we be see it really be just a new idea I mean person toss around sustainability but we have to figure out what sustainability be in less than 200 year you know just in a few generation we have go from be 200 be 100 percent 95 percent farmer to less than 2 percent of farmer we now live in a country that have more prisoner than farmer 2 1 million prisoner 1 9 million farmer and we spend 35 000 dollar on average a year keep a prisoner in prison and school district spend 500 dollar a year feed a child it be no wonder you know we have criminal laughter and what be happen be we be get sick we be get sick and we kid be get sick it be about what we feed they what go in be what we be we really be what we eat and if we continue down this path if we continue to feed kid bad food if we continue not to teach they what good food be what be go to happen you know what be go to happen what be go to happen to we whole medical system what be go to happen be we be go to have kid that have a life less long than we own the CDC the Center for Disease Control have say of the child bear in the year 2000 that seven and eight year old today one out of every three Caucasian one out of every two African American and Hispanic be go to have diabetes in they lifetime and if that be not enough they have go on to say most before they graduate high school this mean that 40 or 45 percent of all school aged child could be insulin dependent within a decade within a decade what be go to happen well the CDC have go further to say that that child bear in the year 2000 could be the first generation in we country history to die at a young age than they parent and it be because of what we feed they because eight year old do not get to decide and if they do you should be in therapy you know we be responsible for what kid eat but oops maybe they be responsible for what kid eat big company spend 20 billion dollar a year marketing non nutrient food to kid 20 billion dollar a year 10 000 ad most kid see they spend 500 dollar for every one dollar 500 dollar market food that kid should not eat for every one dollar marketing healthy nutritious food the result of which be kid think they be go to die if they do not have chicken nugget you know that everybody think they should be eat more and more and more this be the USDA portion size that little tiny thing and the one over there that be big than my head be what McDonald and Burger King and that big company think we should eat and why can they serve that much why can we have 29 cent big gulp and 99 cent double burger it be because of the way the government commodify food and the cheap corn and cheap soy that be push into we food supply that make this non nutrient food really really cheap which be why I say it be a social justice issue now I say I be do this in Berkeley and you might think oh Berkeley of course you can do it in Berkeley well this be the food I find 24 month ago this be not even food this be the stuff we be feed we kid Extremo Burritos corn dog pizza pocket grill cheese sandwich everything come in plastic in cardboard the only kitchen tool my staff have be a box cutter the only work piece of equipment in my kitchen be a can crusher because if it do not come in a can it come freeze in a box the USDA allow this the USDA allow all of this stuff in case you can not tell that be like pink Danish and some kind of cupcake chicken nugget Tater Tots chocolate milk with high fructose can fruit cocktail a reimbursable meal that be what the government say be okay to feed we kid it be not okay you know what it be not okay and we all of we have to understand that this be about we that we can make a difference here now I do not know if any of you out there invent chicken nugget but I be sure you be rich if you do but whoever decide that a chicken should look like a heart a giraffe a star well Tyson do because there be no chicken in the chicken and that they could figure it out that we could sell this stuff to kid you know what be wrong with teaching kid that chicken look like chicken but this be what most school serve in fact this may be what a lot of parent serve as oppose to this be what we try and serve we really need to change this whole paradigm with kid and food we really have to teach child that chicken be not a giraffe you know that vegetable be actually colorful that they have flavor that carrot grow in the ground that strawberry grow in the ground there be not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush you know we have to change the way we teach kid about this thing there be a lot of stuff we can do there be a lot of school do farm to school program there be a lot of school actually get fresh food into school now in Berkeley we have go totally fresh we have no high fructose corn syrup no trans fat no process food we be cook from scratch every day we have 25 percent of we applause thank you 25 percent of we stuff be organic and local we cook that be my hand I get up at 4 a m every day and go cook the food for the kid because this be what we need to do we can not keep serve kid process crap full of chemical and expect this be go to be healthy citizen you be not go to get the next generation or the generation after to be able to think like this if they be not nourish if they be eat chemical all the time they be not go to be able to think they be not go to be smart you know what they be just go to be sick now one of the thing that what happen when I go into Berkeley be I realize that you know this be all pretty amazing to person very very different and I need to market it I come up with this calendar that I send home to every parent and this calendar really start to lay out my program now I be in charge of all the cooking class and all the gardening class in we school district so this be a typical menu this be what we be serve this week at the school and you see this recipe on the side that be the recipe that the kid learn in my cooking class they do taste of this ingredient in the gardening class they also may be grow they and we serve they in the cafeteria if we be go to change child relationship to food it be delicious nutritious food in the cafeteria hand on experience you be look in cooking and gardening class and academic curriculum to tie it all together now you have probably garner that I do not love the USDA and I do not have any idea what to do with they pyramid this upside down pyramid with a rainbow over the top I do not know you know run up into the end of the rainbow I do not know what you do with it so I come up with my own this be available on my website in English and Spanish and it be a visual way to talk to kid about food the really tiny hamburger the really big vegetable we have to start change this we have to make kid understand that they food choice make a big difference we have cook class we have cook classroom in we school and why this be so important be that we now have grow a generation maybe two of kid where one out of every four meal be eat in fast food one of every four meal be eat in a car and one out of every last four meal be eat in front of a tv or computer what be kid learn where be the family time where be socialization where be discussion where be learn to talk you know we have to change it I work with kid a lot this be kid I work with in Harlem EATWISE enlighten and aware teens who Inspire Smart Eating we have to teach kid that Coke and Pop Tarts be not breakfast we have to teach kid that if they be on a diet of refined sugar they go up and down just like if they be on a diet of crack and we have to pull it all together we have composting in all of we school we have recycling in all of we school you know the thing that we maybe do at home and think be so important we have to teach kid about in school it have to be so much a part of they that they really get it because you know what many of we be sort of at the end of we career and we need to be give this kid this young kid the next generation the tool to save themselves and save the planet one of the thing I do a lot be public private partnership I work with private company who be willing to do r d with I who be willing to do distribution for I who be really willing to work to go into school school be underfund most school in America spend less than 7 500 dollar a year teach a child that come down to under five dollar a hour most of you spend 10 15 dollar a hour for babysitter when you have they so we be spend less than 5 dollar a hour on the educational system and if we be go to change it and change how we feed kid we really have to rethink that so public and private partnership advocacy group work with foundation in we school district the way we afford this be we school district allocate 03 percent of the general fund towards nutrition service and I think if every school district allocate a half to one percent we could start to really fix this program we really need to change it it be go to take more money of course it be not all about food it be also about kid get exercise and one of the simple thing we can do be put recess before lunch it be sort of this duh thing you know if you have kid come into lunch and all they be go to do when they get out of lunch be go to have recess you see they just throw away they lunch so they can run outside and then at one in the afternoon they be totally crash this be you child and grandchild that be totally melt down when you pick they up because they have not have lunch so if the only thing they would have to do after lunch be go to class believe I they be go to sit there and eat they lunch we need to we need to educate we need to educate the kid we need to educate the staff I have 90 employee two be suppose to be cook none could and you know I be not that good off now but we really have to educate we have to get academic institution to start think about way to teach person how to cook again because of course they do not because we have have this process food in school and institution for so long we need 40 minute lunch most school have 20 minute lunch and lunch that be time appropriate there be just a big study do and so many school be start lunch at nine and 10 in the morning that be not lunchtime you know it be crazy it be crazy what we be do and just remember at very least tacitly this be what we be teach child as what they should be do I think if we be go to fix this one of the thing we have to do be really change how we have oversight over the National School lunch program instead of the National School lunch program be under the USDA I think it should be under CDC if we start to think about food and how we feed we kid as a health initiative and we start think about food as health then I think we would not have corn dog as lunch okay finance 101 on this and this I be sort of wrap it up with this finance piece because I think this be something we all have to understand the National School lunch program spend 8 billion dollar feed 30 million child a year that number probably need to double person say oh my god where be we go to get 8 billion in this country we be spend 110 billion dollar a year on fast food we spend 100 billion dollar a year on diet aid we spend 50 billion dollar on vegetable which be why we need all the diet aid we spend 200 billion dollar a year on diet relate illness today with nine percent of we kid have type 2 diabetes 200 billion so you know what when we talk about need 8 billion more it be not a lot that 8 billion come down to two dollar and 49 cent that be what the government allocate for lunch most school district spend two third of that on payroll and overhead that mean we spend less than a dollar a day on food for kid in school most school 80 to 90 cent in l a it be 56 cent so we be spend less than a dollar ok on lunch now I do not know about you but I go to Starbucks and Pete and place like that and venti latte in San Francisco be five dollar one gourmet coffee one be more we spend more on than we be spend to feed kid for a entire week in we school you know what we should be ashamed we as a country should be ashamed at that the rich country in we country it be the kid that need it the most who get this really really lousy food it be the kid who have parent and grandparent and uncle and aunt that can not even afford to pay for school lunch that get this food and that be the same kid who be go to be get sick that be the same kid who we should be take care of we can all make a difference that every single one of we whether we have child whether we care about child whether we have niece or nephew or anything that we can make a difference whether you sit down and eat a meal with you kid whether you take you kid or grandchild or niece and nephew shop to a farmer market just do taste with they sit down and care and on the macro level we be in what seem to be a 19 month presidential campaign and of all the thing we be ask all of this potential leader what about ask for the health of we child thank you
