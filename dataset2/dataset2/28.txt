I think I be suppose to talk about my new book which be call blink and it be about snap judgment and first impression and it come out in January and I hope you all buy it in triplicate laughter but I be think about this and I realize that although my new book make I happy and I think would make my mother happy it be not really about happiness so I decide instead I would talk about someone who I think have do as much to make American happy as perhaps anyone over the last 20 year a man who be a great personal hero of mine someone by the name of Howard Moskowitz who be most famous for reinvent spaghetti sauce Howard about this high and he be round and he be in he 60 and he have big huge glass and thinning gray hair and he have a kind of wonderful exuberance and vitality and he have a parrot and he love the opera and he be a great aficionado of medieval history and by profession he be a psychophysicist now I should tell you that I have no idea what psychophysic be although at some point in my life I date a girl for two year who be get she doctorate in psychophysic which should tell you something about that relationship laughter as far as I know psychophysic be about measure thing and Howard be very interested in measure thing and he graduate with he doctorate from Harvard and he set up a little consulting shop in White Plains New York and one of he first client be Pepsi this be many year ago back in the early 70 and Pepsi come to Howard and they say you know there be this new thing call aspartame and we would like to make Diet Pepsi we would like you to figure out how much aspartame we should put in each can of Diet Pepsi in order to have the perfect drink now that sound like a incredibly straightforward question to answer and that be what Howard think because Pepsi tell he we be work with a band between eight and 12 percent anything below eight percent sweetness be not sweet enough anything above 12 percent sweetness be too sweet we want to know what be the sweet spot between 8 and 12 now if I give you this problem to do you would all say it be very simple what we do be you make up a big experimental batch of Pepsi at every degree of sweetness eight percent 8 1 8 2 8 3 all the way up to 12 and we try this out with thousand of person and we plot the result on a curve and we take the most popular concentration right really simple Howard do the experiment and he get the datum back and he plot it on a curve and all of a sudden he realize it be not a nice bell curve in fact the datum do not make any sense it be a mess it be all over the place now most person in that business in the world of testing food and such be not dismay when the datum come back a mess they think well you know figure out what person think about cola be not that easy you know maybe we make a error somewhere along the way you know let just make a educate guess and they simply point and they go for 10 percent right in the middle Howard be not so easily placate Howard be a man of a certain degree of intellectual standard and this be not good enough for he and this question bedevil he for year and he would think it through and say what be wrong why could we not make sense of this experiment with Diet Pepsi and one day he be sit in a diner in White Plains about to go try to dream up some work for Nescaf and suddenly like a bolt of lightning the answer come to he and that be that when they analyze the Diet Pepsi datum they be ask the wrong question they be look for the perfect Pepsi and they should have be look for the perfect Pepsis trust I this be a enormous revelation this be one of the most brilliant breakthrough in all of food science Howard immediately go on the road and he would go to conference around the country and he would stand up and say you have be look for the perfect Pepsi you be wrong you should be look for the perfect Pepsis and person would look at he blankly and say what be you talk about craziness and they would say move next try to get business nobody would hire he he be obsess though and he talk about it and talk about it Howard love the Yiddish expression to a worm in horseradish the world be horseradish this be he horseradish laughter he be obsess with it and finally he have a breakthrough Vlasic Pickles come to he and they say Doctor Moskowitz we want to make the perfect pickle and he say there be no perfect pickle there be only perfect pickle and he come back to they and he say you do not just need to improve you regular you need to create zesty and that be where we get zesty pickle then the next person come to he Campbell Soup and this be even more important in fact Campbell Soup be where Howard make he reputation Campbell make Prego and Prego in the early 80 be struggle next to rag which be the dominant spaghetti sauce of the 70 and 80 in the industry I do not know whether you care about this or how much time I have to go into this but it be technically speak this be a aside Prego be a good tomato sauce than rag the quality of the tomato paste be much good the spice mix be far superior it adhere to the pasta in a much more pleasing way in fact they would do the famous bowl test back in the 70 with rag and Prego you would have a plate of spaghetti and you would pour it on right and the rag would all go to the bottom and the Prego would sit on top that be call adherence and anyway despite the fact that they be far superior in adherence and the quality of they tomato paste Prego be struggle so they come to Howard and they say fix we and Howard look at they product line and he say what you have be a dead tomato society so he say this be what I want to do and he get together with the Campbell soup kitchen and he make 45 variety of spaghetti sauce and he vary they accord to every conceivable way that you can vary tomato sauce by sweetness by level of garlic by tomatoey ness by tartness by sourness by visible solid my favorite term in the spaghetti sauce business laughter every conceivable way you can vary spaghetti sauce he vary spaghetti sauce and then he take this whole raft of 45 spaghetti sauce and he go on the road he go to New York to Chicago he go to Jacksonville to Los Angeles and he bring in person by the truckload into big hall and he sit they down for two hour and over the course of that two hour he give they ten bowl ten small bowl of pasta with a different spaghetti sauce on each one and after they eat each bowl they have to rate from 0 to 100 how good they think the spaghetti sauce be at the end of that process after do it for month and month he have a mountain of datum about how the American person feel about spaghetti sauce and then he analyze the datum do he look for the most popular variety of spaghetti sauce no Howard do not believe that there be such a thing instead he look at the datum and he say let see if we can group all this different datum point into cluster let see if they congregate around certain idea and sure enough if you sit down and you analyze all this datum on spaghetti sauce you realize that all American fall into one of three group there be person who like they spaghetti sauce plain there be person who like they spaghetti sauce spicy and there be person who like it extra chunky and of that three fact the third one be the most significant because at the time in the early 1980 if you go to a supermarket you would not find extra chunky spaghetti sauce and Prego turn to Howard and they say you be tell I that one third of American crave extra chunky spaghetti sauce and yet no one be service they need and he say yes laughter and Prego then go back and completely reformulate they spaghetti sauce and come out with a line of extra chunky that immediately and completely take over the spaghetti sauce business in this country and over the next 10 year they make 600 million dollar off they line of extra chunky sauce everyone else in the industry look at what Howard have do and they say oh my god we have be think all wrong and that be when you start to get seven different kind of vinegar and 14 different kind of mustard and 71 different kind of olive oil and then eventually even Rag hire Howard and Howard do the exact same thing for rag that he do for Prego and today if you go to a really good supermarket do you know how many rag s there be 36 in six variety cheese light Robusto Rich Hearty Old World Traditional Extra Chunky Garden laughter that be Howard do that be Howard gift to the American person now why be that important laughter it be in fact enormously important I will explain to you why what Howard do be he fundamentally change the way the food industry think about make you happy Assumption number one in the food industry use to be that the way to find out what person want to eat what will make person happy be to ask they and for year and year and year rag and Prego would have focus group and they would sit you down and they would say what do you want in a spaghetti sauce tell we what you want in a spaghetti sauce and for all that year 20 30 year through all that focus group session no one ever say they want extra chunky even though at least a third of they deep in they heart actually do laughter person do not know what they want as Howard love to say the mind know not what the tongue want it be a mystery laughter and a critically important step in understand we own desire and taste be to realize that we can not always explain what we want deep down if I ask all of you for example in this room what you want in a coffee you know what you would say every one of you would say I want a dark rich hearty roast it be what person always say when you ask they what do you like Dark rich hearty roast what percentage of you actually like a dark rich hearty roast accord to Howard somewhere between 25 and 27 percent of you most of you like milky weak coffee laughter but you will never ever say to someone who ask you what you want that I want a milky weak coffee so that be number one thing that Howard do number two thing that Howard do be he make we realize it be another very critical point he make we realize the importance of what he like to call horizontal segmentation why be this critical because this be the way the food industry think before Howard what be they obsess with in the early 80 they be obsess with mustard in particular they be obsess with the story of Grey Poupon use to be there be two mustard French and Gulden what be they yellow mustard what be in it yellow mustard seed turmeric and paprika that be mustard Grey Poupon come along with a Dijon right much more volatile brown mustard seed some white wine a nose hit much more delicate aromatic and what do they do they put it in a little tiny glass jar with a wonderful enameled label on it make it look French even though it be make in Oxnard California laughter and instead of charge a dollar fifty for the eight ounce bottle the way that French and Gulden do they decide to charge four dollar and they have that ad with the guy in the Rolls Royce eat the Grey Poupon another pull up and say do you have any Grey Poupon and the whole thing after they do that Grey Poupon take off take over the mustard business and everyone be take home lesson from that be that the way to make person happy be to give they something that be more expensive something to aspire to it be to make they turn they back on what they think they like now and reach out for something high up the mustard hierarchy laughter a good mustard a more expensive mustard a mustard of more sophistication and culture and mean and Howard look to that and say that be wrong mustard do not exist on a hierarchy mustard exist just like tomato sauce on a horizontal plane there be no good mustard or bad mustard there be no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard there be only different kind of mustard that suit different kind of person he fundamentally democratize the way we think about taste and for that as well we owe Howard Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks Third thing that Howard do and perhaps the most important be Howard confront the notion of the Platonic dish laughter what do I mean by that laughter for the long time in the food industry there be a sense that there be one way a perfect way to make a dish you go to Chez Panisse they give you the red tail sashimi with roasted pumpkin seed in a something something reduction they do not give you five option on the reduction they do not say do you want the extra chunky reduction or no you just get the reduction why because the chef at Chez Panisse have a Platonic notion about red tail sashimi this be the way it ought to be and she serve it that way time and time again and if you quarrel with she she will say you know what you be wrong this be the good way it ought to be in this restaurant now that same idea fuel the commercial food industry as well they have a Platonic notion of what tomato sauce be and where do that come from it come from Italy Italian tomato sauce be what it be blend it be thin the culture of tomato sauce be thin when we talk about authentic tomato sauce in the 1970 we talk about Italian tomato sauce we talk about the early rag s which have no visible solid right which be thin you just put a little bit and it sink down to the bottom of the pasta that be what it be and why be we attach to that because we think that what it take to make person happy be to provide they with the most culturally authentic tomato sauce a and b we think that if we give they the culturally authentic tomato sauce then they would embrace it and that be what would please the maximum number of person in other word person in the cooking world be look for cook universal they be look for one way to treat all of we and it be good reason for they to be obsess with the idea of universal because all of science through the 19th century and much of the 20th be obsess with universal psychologist medical scientist economist be all interested in find out the rule that govern the way all of we behave but that change right what be the great revolution in science of the last 10 15 year it be the movement from the search for universal to the understanding of variability now in medical science we do not want to know necessarily just how cancer work we want to know how you cancer be different from my cancer I guess my cancer different from you cancer Genetics have open the door to the study of human variability what Howard Moskowitz be do be say this same revolution need to happen in the world of tomato sauce and for that we owe he a great vote of thanks I will give you one last illustration of variability and that be oh I be sorry Howard not only believe that but he take it a second step which be to say that when we pursue universal principle in food we be not just make a error we be actually do ourselves a massive disservice and the example he use be coffee and coffee be something he do a lot of work with with Nescaf if I be to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee a type of coffee a brew that make all of you happy and then I ask you to rate that coffee the average score in this room for coffee would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100 if however you allow I to break you into coffee cluster maybe three or four coffee cluster and I could make coffee just for each of that individual cluster you score would go from 60 to 75 or 78 the difference between coffee at 60 and coffee at 78 be a difference between coffee that make you wince and coffee that make you deliriously happy that be the final and I think most beautiful lesson of Howard Moskowitz that in embrace the diversity of human being we will find a sure way to true happiness thank you applause
