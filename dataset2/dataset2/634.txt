let pretend right here we have a machine a big machine a cool TED ish machine and it be a time machine and everyone in this room have to get into it and you can go backwards you can go forwards you can not stay where you be and I wonder what you have choose because I have be ask my friend this question a lot lately and they all want to go back I do not know they want to go back before there be automobile or Twitter or American Idol I do not know I be convince that there be some sort of pull to nostalgia to wishful thinking and I understand that I be not part of that crowd I have to say I do not want to go back and it be not because I be adventurous it be because possibility on this planet they do not go back they go forward so I want to get in the machine and I want to go forward this be the great time there be ever be on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose health wealth mobility opportunity decline rate of disease there be never be a time like this my great grandparent die all of they by the time they be 60 my grandparent push that number to 70 my parent be close in on 80 so there good be a nine at the beginning of my death number but it be not even about person like we because this be a big deal than that a kid bear in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the rich man in the world do 100 year ago think about that it be a incredible fact and why be it true Smallpox Smallpox kill billion of person on this planet it reshape the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever have it be go it be vanish we vanquish it Puff in the rich world disease that threaten million of we just a generation ago no long exist hardly Diphtheria rubella polio do anyone even know what that thing be vaccine modern medicine we ability to feed billion of person that be triumph of the scientific method and to my mind the scientific method try stuff out see if it work change it when it do not be one of the great accomplishment of humanity so that be the good news unfortunately that be all the good news because there be some other problem and they have be mention many time and one of they be that despite all we accomplishment a billion person go to bed hungry in this world every day that number rise and it be rise really rapidly and it be disgraceful and not only that we have use we imagination to thoroughly trash this globe potable water arable land rainforest oil gas they be go away and they be go away soon and unless we innovate we way out of this mess we be go away too so the question be can we do that and I think we can I think it be clear that we can make food that will feed billion of person without rape the land that they live on I think we can power this world with energy that do not also destroy it I really do believe that and no it be not wishful thinking but here be the thing that keep I up at night one of the thing that keep I up at night we have never need progress in science more than we need it right now never and we have also never be in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today we be on the verge of amazing amazing event in many field and yet I actually think we would have to go back hundred 300 year before the Enlightenment to find a time when we battle progress when we fight about this thing more vigorously on more front than we do now People wrap themselves in they belief and they do it so tightly that you can not set they free not even the truth will set they free and listen everyone entitle to they opinion they be even entitle to they opinion about progress but you know what you be not entitle to you be not entitle to you own fact sorry you be not and this take I awhile to figure out about a decade ago I write a story about vaccine for the New Yorker A little story and I be amazed to find opposition opposition to what be after all the most effective public health measure in human history I do not know what to do so I just do what I do I write a story and I move on and soon after that I write a story about genetically engineer food same thing only big person be go crazy so I write a story about that too and I could not understand why person think this be Frankenfoods why they think move molecule around in a specific rather than a haphazard way be trespassing on nature ground but you know I do what I do I write the story I move on I mean I be a journalist we type we file we go to dinner it be fine laughter but this story bother I and I could not figure out why and eventually I do and that be because that fanatic that be drive I crazy be not actually fanatic at all they be thoughtful person educate person decent person they be exactly like the person in this room and it just disturb I so much but then I think you know let be honest we be at a point in this world where we do not have the same relationship to progress that we use to we talk about it ambivalently we talk about it in ironic term with little quote around it progress okay there be reason for that and I think we know what that reason be we have lose faith in institution in authority and sometimes in science itself and there be no reason we should not have you can just say a few name and person will understand Chernobyl Bhopal the Challenger Vioxx weapon of mass destruction hang chad you know you can choose you list there be question and problem with the person we use to believe be always right so be skeptical ask question demand proof demand evidence do not take anything for grant but here be the thing when you get proof you need to accept the proof and we be not that good at do that and the reason that I can say that be because we be now in a epidemic of fear like one I have never see and hope never to see again about 12 year ago there be a story publish a horrible story that link the epidemic of autism to the measles mumps and rubella vaccine shoot very scary ton of study be do to see if this be true ton of study should have be do it be a serious issue the datum come back the datum come back from the United States from England from Sweden from Canada and it be all the same no correlation no connection none at all it do not matter it do not matter because we believe anecdote we believe what we see what we think we see what make we feel real we do not believe a bunch of document from a government official give we datum and I do understand that I think we all do but you know what the result of that have be disastrous disastrous because here be a fact the United States be one of the only country in the world where the vaccine rate for measles be go down that be disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves it be horrible what kind of a thing happen that we could do that now I understand it I do understand it because do anyone have measles here have one person in this audience ever see someone die of measles do not happen very much do not happen in this country at all but it happen 160 000 time in the world last year that be a lot of death of measles 20 a hour but since it do not happen here we can put it out of we mind and person like Jenny McCarthy can go around preach message of fear and illiteracy from platform like Oprah and Larry King live and they can do it because they do not link causation and correlation they do not understand that this thing seem the same but they be almost never the same and it be something we need to learn and we need to learn it really soon this guy be a hero Jonas Salk he take one of the bad scourge of mankind away from we no fear no agony Polio puff go that guy in the middle not so much he name be Paul Offit he just develop a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other person it will save the life of 400 to 500 000 kid in the develop world every year pretty good right well it be good except that Paul go around talk about vaccine and say how valuable they be and that person ought to just stop the whine and he actually say it that way so Paul a terrorist when Paul speak in a public hearing he can not testify without armed guard he get call at home because person like to tell he that they remember where he kid go to school and why because Paul make a vaccine I do not need to say this but vaccine be essential you take they away disease come back horrible disease and that be happen we have measles in this country now and it be get bad and pretty soon kid be go to die of it again because it be just a number game and they be not just go to die of measles what about polio let have that why not a college classmate of mine write I a couple week ago and say she think I be a little strident no one ever say that before she be not go to vaccinate she kid against polio no way fine why because we do not have polio and you know what we do not have polio in this country yesterday today I do not know maybe a guy get on a plane in Lagos this morning and he be fly to lax right now he be over Ohio and he be go to land in a couple of hour he be go to rent a car and he be go to come to Long Beach and he be go to attend one of this fabulous TED dinner tonight and he do not know that he be infect with a paralytic disease and we do not either because that be the way the world work that be the planet we live on do not pretend it be not now we love to wrap ourselves in lie we love to do it everyone take they vitamin this morning Echinacea a little antioxidant to get you go I know you do because half of American do every day they take the stuff and they take alternative medicine and it do not matter how often we find out that they be useless the datum say it all the time they darken you urine they almost never do more than that laughter it be okay you want to pay 28 billion dollar for dark urine I be totally with you laughter dark urine dark why do we do that why do we do that well I think I understand we hate big Pharma we hate big government we do not trust the Man and we should not we health care system suck it be cruel to million of person it be absolutely astonishingly cold and soul bend to that of we who can even afford it so we run away from it and where do we run we leap into the arm of big placebo laughter that be fantastic I love big placebo applause but you know it be really a serious thing because this stuff be crap and we spend billion of dollar on it and I have all sort of little prop here none of it ginkgo fraud echinacea fraud acai I do not even know what that be but we be spend billion of dollar on it it be fraud and you know what when I say this stuff person scream at I and they say what do you care let person do what they want to do it make they feel good and you know what you be wrong because I do not care if it be the secretary of HHS who be say hmm I be not go to take the evidence of my expert on mammogram or some cancer quack who want to treat he patient with coffee enema when you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science you end up in a place you do not want to be you end up in Thabo Mbeki South Africa he kill 400 000 of he person by insist that beetroot garlic and lemon oil be much more effective than the antiretroviral drug we know can slow the course of AIDS hundred of thousand of needless death in a country that have be plague bad than any other by this disease please do not tell I there be no consequence to this thing there be there always be now the most mindless epidemic we be in the middle of right now be this absurd battle between proponent of genetically engineer food and the organic elite it be a idiotic debate it have to stop it be a debate about word about metaphor it be ideology it be not science every single thing we eat every grain of rice every sprig of parsley every Brussels sprout have be modify by man you know there be not tangerine in the garden of Eden there be not any cantaloupe laughter there be not Christmas tree we make it all we make it over the last 11 000 year and some of it work and some of it do not we get rid of the stuff that do not now we can do it in a more precise way and there be risk absolutely but we can put something like vitamin a into rice and that stuff can help million of person million of person prolong they life you do not want to do that I have to say I do not understand it we object to genetically engineer food why do we do that well the thing I constantly hear be too many chemical pesticide hormone monoculture we do not want giant field of the same thing that be wrong we do not company patent life we do not want company own seed and you know what my response to all of that be yes you be right let fix it it be true we have get a huge food problem but this be not science this have nothing to do with science it be law it be morality it be patent stuff you know science be not a company it be not a country it be not even a idea it be a process it be a process and sometimes it work and sometimes it do not but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we be afraid be really very deadening and it be prevent million of person from prosper you know in the next 50 year we be go to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now 70 percent this investment in Africa over the last 30 year disgraceful disgraceful they need it and we be not give it to they and why genetically engineer food we do not want to encourage person to eat that rotten stuff like cassava for instance Cassava something that half a billion person eat it be kind of like a potato it be just a bunch of calorie it suck it do not have nutrient it do not have protein and scientist be engineer all of that into it right now and then person would be able to eat it and they would be able to not go blind they would not starve and you know what that would be nice it would not be Chez Panisse but it would be nice and all I can say about this be why be we fight it I mean let ask ourselves why be we fight it because we do not want to move gene around this be about move gene around it be not about chemical it be not about we ridiculous passion for hormone we insistence on have big food good food singular food this be not about Rice Krispies this be about keep person alive and it be about time we start to understand what that mean because you know something if we do not if we continue to act the way we be act we be guilty of something that I do not think we want to be guilty of high tech colonialism there be no other way to describe what be go on here it be selfish it be ugly it be beneath we and we really have to stop it so after this amazingly fun conversation laughter you might want to say so you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward absolutely absolutely I do it be stick in the present right now but we have a amazing opportunity we can set that time machine on anything we want we can move it where we want to move it and we be go to move it where we want to move it we have to have this conversation and we have to think but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead we be go to be happy we do I know that we can and as far as I be concern that something the world need right now applause thank you thank you thank you thank you
