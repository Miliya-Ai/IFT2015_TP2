my talk be flap bird and space telescope and you would think that should have nothing to do with one another but I hope by the end of this 18 minute you will see a little bit of a relation it tie to origami so let I start what be origami most person think they know what origami be it be this flap bird toy cootie catcher that sort of thing and that be what origami use to be but it be become something else it be become a art form a form of sculpture the common theme what make it origami be fold be how we create the form you know it be very old this be a plate from 1797 it show this woman play with this toy if you look close it be this shape call a crane every Japanese kid learn how to fold that crane so this art have be around for hundred of year and you would think something that be be around that long so restrictive folding only everything that could be do have be do a long time ago and that might have be the case but in the twentieth century a Japanese folder name Yoshizawa come along and he create ten of thousand of new design but even more importantly he create a language a way we could communicate a code of dot dash and arrow harken back to Susan Blackmore talk we now have a means of transmit information with heredity and selection and we know where that lead and where it have lead in origami be to thing like this this be a origami figure one sheet no cut fold only hundred of fold this too be origami and this show where we have go in the modern world naturalism Detail you can get horn antler even if you look close cloven hoof and it raise a question what change and what change be something you might not have expect in a art which be math that be person apply mathematical principle to the art to discover the underlie law and that lead to a very powerful tool the secret to productivity in so many field and in origami be let dead person do you work for you laughter because what you can do be take you problem and turn it into a problem that someone else have solve and use they solution and I want to tell you how we do that in origami origami revolve around crease pattern the crease pattern show here be the underlie blueprint for a origami figure and you can not just draw they arbitrarily they have to obey four simple law and they be very simple easy to understand the first law be two colorability you can color any crease pattern with just two color without ever have the same color meet the direction of the fold at any vertex the number of mountain fold the number of valley fold always differ by two two more or two less nothing else if you look at the angle around the fold you find that if you number the angle in a circle all the even number angle add up to a straight line all the odd numbered angle add up to a straight line and if you look at how the layer stack you will find that no matter how you stack fold and sheet a sheet can never penetrate a fold so that be four simple law that be all you need in origami all of origami come from that and you would think can four simple law give rise to that kind of complexity but indeed the law of quantum mechanic can be write down on a napkin and yet they govern all of chemistry all of life all of history if we obey this law we can do amazing thing so in origami to obey this law we can take simple pattern like this repeat pattern of fold call texture and by itself it be nothing but if we follow the law of origami we can put this pattern into another fold that itself might be something very very simple but when we put it together we get something a little different this fish 400 scale again it be one uncut square only folding and if you do not want to fold 400 scale you can back off and just do a few thing and add plate to the back of a turtle or toe or you can ramp up and go up to 50 star on a flag with 13 stripe and if you want to go really crazy 1 000 scale on a rattlesnake and this guy on display downstairs so take a look if you get a chance the most powerful tool in origami have relate to how we get part of creature and I can put it in this simple equation we take a idea combine it with a square and you get a origami figure laughter what matter be what we mean by that symbol and you might say can you really be that specific I mean a stag beetle it be get two point for jaw it be get antennae can you be that specific in the detail and yeah you really can so how do we do that well we break it down into a few small step so let I stretch out that equation I start with my idea I abstract it what be the most abstract form it be a stick figure and from that stick figure I somehow have to get to a fold shape that have a part for every bit of the subject a flap for every leg and then once I have that fold shape that we call the base you can make the leg narrow you can bend they you can turn it into the finished shape now the first step pretty easy take a idea draw a stick figure the last step be not so hard but that middle step go from the abstract description to the fold shape that be hard but that be the place where the mathematical idea can get we over the hump and I be go to show you all how to do that so you can go out of here and fold something but we be go to start small this base have a lot of flap in it we be go to learn how to make one flap how would you make a single flap take a square fold it in half fold it in half fold it again until it get long and narrow and then we will say at the end of that that be a flap I could use that for a leg a arm anything like that what paper go into that flap well if I unfold it and go back to the crease pattern you can see that the upper left corner of that shape be the paper that go into the flap so that be the flap and all the rest of the paper leave over I can use it for something else well there be other way of make a flap there be other dimension for flap if I make the flap skinny I can use a bit less paper if I make the flap as skinny as possible I get to the limit of the minimum amount of paper need and you can see there it need a quarter circle of paper to make a flap there be other way of make flap if I put the flap on the edge it use a half circle of paper and if I make the flap from the middle it use a full circle so no matter how I make a flap it need some part of a circular region of paper so now we be ready to scale up what if I want to make something that have a lot of flap what do I need I need a lot of circle and in the 1990 origami artist discover this principle and realize we could make arbitrarily complicated figure just by pack circle and here be where the dead person start to help we out because lot of person have study the problem of pack circle I can rely on that vast history of mathematician and artist look at disc packing and arrangement and I can use that pattern now to create origami shape so we figure out this rule whereby you pack circle you decorate the pattern of circle with line accord to more rule that give you the fold that fold fold into a base you shape the base you get a fold shape in this case a cockroach and it be so simple laughter it be so simple that a computer could do it and you say well you know how simple be that but computer you need to be able to describe thing in very basic term and with this we could so I write a computer program a bunch of year ago call TreeMaker and you can download it from my website it be free it run on all the major platform even Windows laughter and you just draw a stick figure and it calculate the crease pattern it do the circle packing calculate the crease pattern and if you use that stick figure that I just show which you can kind of tell it be a deer it be get antl you will get this crease pattern and if you take this crease pattern you fold on the dot line you will get a base that you can then shape into a deer with exactly the crease pattern that you want and if you want a different deer not a white tail deer but you want a mule deer or a elk you change the packing and you can do a elk or you could do a moose or really any other kind of deer this technique revolutionize this art we find we could do insect spider which be close thing with leg thing with leg and wing thing with leg and antennae and if fold a single pray mantis from a single uncut square be not interesting enough then you could do two pray mantis from a single uncut square she be eat he I call it snack time and you can do more than just insect this you can put detail toe and claw a grizzly bear have claw this tree frog have toe actually lot of person in origami now put toe into they model toe have become a origami meme because everyone be do it you can make multiple subject so this be a couple of instrumentalist the guitar player from a single square the bass player from a single square and if you say well but the guitar bass that be not so hot do a little more complicated instrument well then you could do a organ laughter and what this have allow be the creation of origami on demand so now person can say I want exactly this and this and this and you can go out and fold it and sometimes you create high art and sometimes you pay the bill by do some commercial work but I want to show you some example everything you will see here except the car be origami video applause just to show you this really be fold paper computer make thing move but this be all real fold object that we make and we can use this not just for visual but it turn out to be useful even in the real world surprisingly origami and the structure that we have develop in origami turn out to have application in medicine in science in space in the body consumer electronics and more and I want to show you some of this example one of the early be this pattern this fold pattern study by Koryo Miura a Japanese engineer he study a folding pattern and realize this could fold down into a extremely compact package that have a very simple opening and closing structure and he use it to design this solar array it be a artist rendition but it fly in a Japanese telescope in 1995 now there be actually a little origami in the James Webb Space Telescope but it be very simple the telescope go up in space it unfold in two place it fold in third it be a very simple pattern you would not even call that origami they certainly do not need to talk to origami artist but if you want to go high and go large than this then you might need some origami engineer at Lawrence Livermore National Lab have a idea for a telescope much large they call it the Eyeglass the design call for geosynchronous orbit 25 000 mile up 100 meter diameter lens so imagine a lens the size of a football field there be two group of person who be interested in this planetary scientist who want to look up and then other person who want to look down whether you look up or look down how do you get it up in space you have get to get it up there in a rocket and rocket be small so you have to make it small how do you make a large sheet of glass small well about the only way be to fold it up somehow so you have to do something like this this be a small model fold lens you divide up the panel you add flexure but this pattern be not go to work to get something 100 meter down to a few meter so the Livermore engineer want to make use of the work of dead person or perhaps live origamist say let see if someone else be do this sort of thing so they look into the origami community we get in touch with they and I start work with they and we develop a pattern together that scale to arbitrarily large size but that allow any flat ring or disc to fold down into a very neat compact cylinder and they adopt that for they first generation which be not 100 meter it be a five meter but this be a five meter telescope have about a quarter mile focal length and it work perfectly on its test range and it indeed fold up into a neat little bundle now there be other origami in space Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency fly a solar sail and you can see here that the sail expand out and you can still see the fold line the problem that be be solve here be something that need to be big and sheet like at its destination but need to be small for the journey and that work whether you be go into space or whether you be just go into a body and this example be the latter this be a heart stent develop by Zhong you at Oxford University it hold open a block artery when it get to its destination but it need to be much small for the trip there through you blood vessel and this stent fold down use a origami pattern base on a model call the water bomb base airbag designer also have the problem of get flat sheet into a small space and they want to do they design by simulation so they need to figure out how in a computer to flatten a airbag and the algorithm that we develop to do insect turn out to be the solution for airbag to do they simulation and so they can do a simulation like this that be the origami crease form and now you can see the airbag inflate and find out do it work and that lead to a really interesting idea you know where do this thing come from well the heart stent come from that little blow up box that you might have learn in elementary school it be the same pattern call the water bomb base the airbag flatten algorithm come from all the development of circle packing and the mathematical theory that be really develop just to create insect thing with leg the thing be that this often happen in math and science when you get math involved problem that you solve for aesthetic value only or to create something beautiful turn around and turn out to have a application in the real world and as weird and surprising as it may sound origami may someday even save a life thanks applause
