brain magic what be brain magic all about Brain magic to I indicate that area of magic deal with psychological and mind read effect so unlike traditional magic it use the power of word linguistic deception non verbal communication and various other technique to create the illusion of a sixth sense I be go to show you all how easy it be to manipulate the human mind once you know how I want everybody downstairs also to join in with I and everybody I want everybody to put out you hand like this for I first of all ok clap they together once ok reverse you hand now follow my action exactly now about half the audience have they leave hand up why be that ok swap they around put you right hand up Cross you hand over so you right hand go over interlace you finger like this then make sure

if you do not allow I to deceive you mind you would all be able to do this laughter laughter end now you can see how easy it be for I to manipulate the human mind once you know how laughter now I remember when I be about 15 laughter I read a copy of Life magazine which detail a story about a 75 year old blind Russian woman who could sense print letter there be still person try to do it laughter who could sense print letter and even sense color just by touch and she be completely blind she could also read the serial number on bill when they be place face down on a hard surface now I be fascinate but at the same time skeptical how could somebody read use they fingertip you know if you actually think about it if somebody be totally blind a guy yesterday do a demonstration in one of the room where person have to close they eye and they could just hear thing and it be just a really weird thing to try and figure out how could somebody read use they fingertip now early on as part of a tv show that I have come up on MTV I attempt to give a similar demonstration of what be now know as second sight so let take a look video man there we go I be go to guide you into the car Kathryn Thomas laughter man you be ok keep on go KT how be you Keith Barry Kathryn it be Keith here I be go to take you to a secret location ok Kathryn there be no way you could see through that blindfold KT

possible to see through somebody else eye that be the question now most person here would automatically say no ok but I want you to realize some fact I could not see through the blindfold the car be not gimmick or trick in any way the girl I have never meet before all right so I want you to just think about it for a moment a lot of person try to come up with a logical solution to what just happen all right but because you brain be not train in the art of deception the solution you come up with will 99 percent of the time be way off the mark this be because magic be all about direct attention if for instance I do not want you to look at my right hand then I do not look at it but if I want you to look at my right hand then I look at it too you see it be very simple once you know how but very complicated in other way I be go to give you some demonstration right now I need two person to help I out real quick can you come up and let see down at the end here can you also come up real
