it be interesting that in the United States the most significant health care budget go to cardiovascular disease care whether it be private or public there be no comparison at all in Africa where it be a major killer it be totally ignore and that situation can not be right we must do something about it a health status of a nation parallel development of that nation 17 million person die every year from heart disease 32 million heart attack and stroke occur most of this be in develop country and the majority be in Africa 85 percent of global disease burden for cardiovascular disease be in develop country not in the West and yet 90 percent of the resource be in the West who be at risk person like you it be not just the African that should be concern about that all friend of Africa that will have reason to be in Africa at some point in time should be very concerned about this deplorable situation have anyone here wonder what will happen if you go back to you room at night and you start get chest pain shortness of breath sweat you be have a heart attack what be you go to do will you fly back to the U S Germany Europe no you will die 50 percent will die within 24 hour if not treat this be what be go on in a look at the map of the U S the graph here 10 million person here 10 million here by the time you get to 50 it be almost no one leave in Nigeria life expectancy be 47 it be not because some person do not survive childhood illness they do but they do not survive after the time that they reach about 45 year old and 50 year old and that be the time they be most productive that be the time that they should be contribute to Africa development but they be not there the good way to spiral into a cycle of poverty be to kill the parent if you can not secure the parent you can not guarantee the security of the African child what be the risk factor it be very well know I be not go to spend a lot of time on that this be just for information hypertension diabetes obesity lack of exercise the usual suspect right here in Tanzania 30 percent of individual have hypertension 20 percent be get treat only less than one percent be adequately treat if we can treat hypertension alone in Africa we will save 250 000 live a year that be quite significant Easy to treat look at the situation in Mauritius in eight short year we be here talk about HIV malaria which be all good we can not make the mistake we have make with malaria and hiv in eight short year non communicable disease will become the lead cause of death in Africa that be something to keep in mind we can not deal with it with situation like this this be a typical African hospital we can not depend on the elite they go to USA Germany U K for treatment unbelievable you can not depend on foreign aid alone here be the situation country be turn inwards Post 9 11 the United States have have a lot of trouble to deal with they own internal issue so they spend they money try to fix that problem you can not rightly it be not they responsibility it be my responsibility I have to take care of my own problem if they help that be good but that be not my expectation this worsen index of health care or health study in Africa demand a new look we can not keep on do thing the way we have always do they if they have not work we have to look for alternative solution I be here to talk to you about solution this have be what have be a difficult sign to some of we several year ago we start think about it everyone know the problem no one know what the solution be we decide that we need to put we money where we mouth be everyone be ready to throw in money in term of free money aid to develop country talk about sustainable investment no one be interested you can not raise money I have do business in healthcare in the United States I live in Nashville Tennessee health care capital of America it be very easy to raise money for health care venture but start tell they you know we be go to try to do it in Nigeria everyone run away that be totally wrong that of you in the audience here if you want to help Africa invest money in sustainable development let I lead you through a day in the life of the Heart Institute so you get a glimpse of what we do and I will talk a little bit more about it what we have do be to show that high quality health care comparable to the good anywhere in the world can be do in a develop country environment we have 25 position right now all of they train board certify in the USA Canada or Britain we have every modality that can be do in Vanderbilt Cleveland Clinic everywhere in the U S and we do it for about 10 percent of the cost that you will need to do that thing in the United States applause additionally we have a policy that no one be ever turn away because of ability to pay we take care of everyone applause whether you have one dollar two dollar it do not matter and I will tell you how we be able to do it we make sure that we select we equipment properly we go for modular unit unit that have multi modality function have modular component Easy to repair and because of that we do not take thing that be not durable and can not last we emphasize training and we make sure that this process be regenerative very soon we will all be dead and gone but the problem will stay unless we have person take over from where we stop we make sure that we produce some thing ourselves we do not buy unit dose of radiopharmaceutical we get the generator from the company we manufacture they in house ourselves that keep the cost down so for a radiopharmaceutical in the U S that you will get a unit dose for 250 dollar when we be finish manufacture it in house we come at a price of about two dollar applause we recognize that the only way to bridge the gap between the rich and poor country be through education and technology all this problem we be talk about if we bring development they will all disappear technology be a great equalizer how do we make it work it be be prove self care be cost effective it extend opportunity to the rural center and we can use expertise in a very smart way this be the way we center be set up we currently have three location in the Caribbean and we be plan a fourth one and we have now decide to go into Africa we will be do the west African Heart Institute in Port Harcourt Nigeria that project will be start within the next few month we hope to open in 2008 09 and we will do other center this model can be adapt to every disease process all the unit all the center be link through a switch hub to a central server and all the image be populate to review station and we design this telemedicine solution it be proprietary to we and we be happy to share what we have learn with anyone who be interested in do it you can still be profitable we make sure that the telemedicine platform give access to expert medical specialist anywhere in the world just by a click of the button I will lead you through to see how this happen this be at the Heart Institute the doctor from anywhere can log in I can call you in Switzerland and say listen go into we system look at Mrs Jones look at the study tell I what you think they will give I that information and we will make the care of the patient well the patient do not have to travel he do not have to experience the anxiety of not know because of limited expertise we also use a electronic medical record system I be happy to say that the thing we have implement 80 percent of U S practice do not have they and yet the technology be there but you know they have that luxury because if you can not get it in Nashville you can travel to Birmingham two hour away and you will get it if you can not get it in Cleveland you can go to Cincinnati we do not have that luxury so we have to make it happen when we do it we will put the cost of care down and we will extend it to the rural center and make it affordable and everyone will get the care they deserve it can not just be technology we recognize that Prevention must be part of the solution we emphasize that but you know you have to tell person what can be do it be not possible to tell person to do what be go to be expensive and they go home and can not do it they need to be alive they need to feed we recommend exercise as the most effective simple easy thing to do we have have walk every year every March April we form person into group and make they go into challenge which group lose the most weight we give they prize which group record more walk distance by pedometer we give they prize we do this constantly we encourage they to bring child that way we start expose the child from very early on on what this issue be because once they learn it they will stay with it in do this we have create at least 100 skilled job in Jamaica alone and this be physician with expertise and special training we have take care of over 1 000 indigent patient that could have die include four free pacemaker in patient with complete heart block for that that understand cardiology complete heart block mean certain death if you do not get this pacemaker you will be dead so we be pleased with that indirectly we have save the government of Jamaica five million dollar from person that would have go to Miami or Atlanta for care and we have hopefully save a lot of life by the end of this year we would have contribute over one million dollar in indigent care in the first four month it be be 340 000 dollar average 85 000 dollar a month the government will not do that because they have compete need they need to put resource elsewhere but we can still do it person say how can you do that this be how we can do that at least 4 000 rich Jamaican that be head to Miami for treatment have self confess that they do not go to Miami because of the Heart Institute of the caribbean and if they go to Miami they will spend significantly more eight to 10 time more and they feel happy spending it at home get the same quality of care and for that money for every one patient that have the money to pay it give we a opportunity to take care of at least four person that do not have the resource to pay applause for this to work this progress must be sustainable so we emphasize training training be critical we have go further we have form a relationship with the University of Technology Jamaica where I now have a appointment and we be start a biomedical engineering program so that we will train person locally who can repair that equipment that way we be not go to deal with obsolescence and all that kind of issue we be also start ancillary health care technology training program train person in echocardiography cardiac ultrasound that kind of thing now with that kind of train it give person motivation because now they will get a bachelor degree in medical imaging and all that kind of stuff in the process I want you to just hear from the trainee themselves what it have mean for they Video Dr Jason top my name be Jason top I be a senior resident in anesthesia in intensive care at the University Hospital of the West Indies I come to the Heart Institute in 2006 as part of my elective in my anesthesia and intensive care program I spend three month at the Heart Institute there be be no doubt around my colleague about the utility of the training I receive here and I think there be be a increase interest now in particularly in echocardiography and its use in we set Sharon Lazarus I be a echocardiographer at the Heart Institute of the Caribbean since the past two year I receive training at this institution I think this aspect of training in cardiology that the Heart Institute of the Caribbean have introduce in Jamaica be very important in term of diagnose cardiac disease Ernest Madu the lesson in this be that it can be do and it can be sustain and you can make it possible for everyone who be we to decide that poor person can not get the good care when have you be appoint to play God it be not my decision my job be to make sure that every person no matter what fate have assign to you will have the opportunity to get the good quality health care in life next stop be west African Heart Institute that we be go to be do in Port Harcourt Nigeria as I say before we will do other center across West Africa we will extend the same system into other area like dialysis treatment and anyone who be interested in do it in any health care situation we will be happy to assist you and tell you how we have do it and how you can do it if we do this we can change the face of health care in Africa Africa have be good to we it be time for we to give back to Africa I be go that who want to come I welcome you to come along with I thank you applause
