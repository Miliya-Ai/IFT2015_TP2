what technology can we really apply to reduce global poverty and what I find be quite surprising we start look at thing like death rate in the 20th century and how they have be improve and very simple thing turn out you would think maybe antibiotic make more difference than clean water but it be actually the opposite and so very simple thing off the shelf technology that we could easily find on the then early web would clearly make a huge difference to that problem but I also in look at more powerful technology and nanotechnology and genetic engineering and other new emerge kind of digital technology become very concerned about the potential for abuse if you think about it in history a long long time ago we deal with the problem of a individual abuse another individual we come up with something the ten commandment thou shalt not kill that be a kind of a one on one thing we organize into city we have many person and to keep the many from tyrannize the one we come up with concept like individual liberty and then to have to deal with large group say at the nation state level and we have to have mutual non aggression or through a series of conflict we eventually come to a rough international bargain to largely keep the peace but now we have a new situation really what person call a asymmetric situation where technology be so powerful that it extend beyond a nation state it be not the nation state that have potential access to mass destruction but individual and this be a consequence of the fact that this new technology tend to be digital we see genome sequence you can download the gene sequence of pathogen off the internet if you want to and clearly someone recently I see in a science magazine they say well the 1918 flu be too dangerous to fedex around if person want to use it in they lab for work on research just reconstruct it yourself because you know it might break in fedex so that this be possible to do this be not deniable so individual in small group super empower by access to this kind of self replicate technology whether it be biological or other be clearly a danger in we world and the danger be that they can cause roughly what be a pandemic and we really do not have experience with pandemic and we be also not very good as a society at act to thing we do not have direct and sort of gut level experience with so it be not in we nature to pre act and in this case pile on more technology do not solve the problem because it only super empower person more so the solution have to be as person like Russell and Einstein and other imagine in a conversation that exist in a much strong form I think early in the 20th century that the solution have to be not just the head but the heart you know public policy and moral progress the bargain that give we civilization be a bargain to not use power we get we individual right by society protect we from other not do everything they can do but largely do only what be legal and so to limit the danger of this new thing we have to limit ultimately the ability of individual to have access essentially to pandemic power we also have to have sensible defense because no limitation be go to prevent a crazy person from do something and you know and the troubling thing be that it be much easy to do something bad than to defend against all possible bad thing so the offensive use really have a asymmetric advantage so this be the kind of thought I be think in 1999 and 2000 and my friend tell I I be get really depressed and they be really worried about I and then I sign a book contract to write more gloomy thought about this and move into a hotel room in New York with one room full of book on the Plague and you know nuclear bomb explode in New York where I would be within the circle and so on and then I be there on September 11th and I stand in the street with everyone and it be quite a experience to be there I get up the next morning and walk out of the city and all the sanitation truck be park on Houston Street and ready to go down and start take the rubble away and I walk down the middle up to the train station and everything below 14th Street be close it be quite a compelling experience but not really I suppose a surprise to someone who have have he room full of the book it be always a surprise that it happen then and there but it be not a surprise that it happen at all and everyone then start write about this thousand of person start write about this and I eventually abandon the book and then Chris call I to talk at the conference I really do not talk about this anymore because you know there be enough frustrating and depressing thing go on but I agree to come and say a few thing about this and I would say that we can not give up the rule of law to fight a asymmetric threat which be what we seem to be do because of the present the person that be in power because that be to give up the thing that make civilization and we can not fight the threat in the kind of stupid way we be do because a million dollar act cause a billion dollar of damage cause a trillion dollar response which be largely ineffective and arguably probably almost certainly have make the problem bad so we can not fight the thing with a million to one cost one to a million cost benefit ratio so after give up on the book and I have the great honor to be able to join Kleiner Perkins about a year ago and to work through venture capital on the innovative side and to try to find some innovation that could address what I see as some of this big problem thing where you know a factor of 10 difference can make a factor of 1 000 difference in the outcome I have be amazed in the last year at the incredible quality and excitement of the innovation that have come across my desk it be overwhelming at time I be very thankful for Google and Wikipedia so I can understand at least a little of what person be talk about who come through the door but I want to share with you three area that I be particularly excited about and that relate to the problem that I be talk about in the Wired article the first be this whole area of education and it really relate to what Nicholas be talk about with a 100 computer and that be to say that there be a lot of leg leave in Moore Law the most advanced transistor today be at 65 nanometer and we have see and I have have the pleasure to invest in company that give I great confidence that we will extend Moore Law all the way down to roughly the 10 nanometer scale another factor of say six in dimensional reduction which should give we about another factor of 100 in raw improvement in what the chip can do and so to put that in practical term if something cost about 1 000 dollar today say the good personal computer you can buy that might be its cost I think we can have that in 2020 for 10 dollar okay now just imagine what that 100 computer will be in 2020 as a tool for education I think the challenge for we be I be very certain that that will happen the challenge be will we develop the kind of educational tool and thing with the net to let we take advantage of that device I would argue today that we have incredibly powerful computer but we do not have very good software for they and it be only in retrospect after the good software come along and you take it and you run it on a ten year old machine you say God the machine be that fast I remember when they take the Apple Mac interface and they put it back on the Apple II the Apple II be perfectly capable of run that kind of interface we just do not know how to do it at the time so give that we know and should believe because Moore Law be be like a constant I mean it be just be very predictable progress over the last 40 year or whatever we can know what the computer be go to be like in 2020 it be great that we have initiative to say let go create the education and educate person in the world because that be a great force for peace and we can give everyone in the world a 100 computer or a 10 computer in the next 15 year the second area that I be focus on be the environmental problem because that be clearly go to put a lot of pressure on this world we will hear a lot more about that from Al Gore very shortly the thing that we see as the kind of Moore Law trend that be drive improvement in we ability to address the environmental problem be new material we have a challenge because the urban population be grow in this century from two billion to six billion in a very short amount of time person be move to the city they all need clean water they need energy they need transportation and we want they to develop in a green way we be reasonably efficient in the industrial sector we have make improvement in energy and resource efficiency but the consumer sector especially in America be very inefficient but this new material bring such incredible innovation that there be a strong basis for hope that this thing will be so profitable that they can be bring to the market and I want to give you a specific example of a new material that be discover 15 year ago if we take carbon nanotube you know Iijima discover they in 1991 they just have incredible property and this be the kind of thing we be go to discover as we start to engineer at the nano scale they strength they be almost the strong material tensile strength material know they be very very stiff they stretch very very little in two dimension if you make like a fabric out of they they be 30 time strong than Kevlar and if you make a three dimensional structure like a buckyball they have all sort of incredible property if you shoot a particle at they and knock a hole in they they repair themselves they go zip and they repair the hole in femtosecond which be not be really quick laughter if you shine a light on they they produce electricity in fact if you flash they with a camera they catch on fire if you put electricity on they they emit light if you run current through they you can run 1 000 time more current through one of this than through a piece of metal you can make both p and n type semiconductor which mean you can make transistor out of they they conduct heat along they length but not across well there be no width but not in the other direction if you stack they up that be a property of carbon fiber also if you put particle in they and they go shoot out the tip they be like miniature linear accelerator or electron gun the inside of the nanotube be so small the small one be 0 7 nanometer that it be basically a quantum world it be a strange place inside a nanotube and so we begin to see and we have see business plan already where the kind of thing Lisa Randall talk about be in there I have one business plan where I be try to learn more about Witten cosmic dimension string to try to understand what the phenomenon be go on in this propose nanomaterial so inside of a nanotube we be really at the limit here so what we see be with this and other new material that we can do thing with different property light strong and apply this new material to the environmental problem new material that can make water new material that can make fuel cell work good new material that catalyze chemical reaction that cut pollution and so on ethanol new way of make ethanol new way of make electric transportation the whole green dream because it can be profitable and we have dedicate we have just raise a new fund we dedicate 100 million dollar to this kind of investment we believe that Genentech the Compaq the Lotus the Sun the Netscape the Amazon the Google in this field be yet to be find because this material revolution will drive this thing forward the third area that we be work on and we just announce last week we be all in New York we raise 200 million dollar in a specialty fund to work on a pandemic in biodefense and to give you a idea of the last fund that Kleiner raise be a 400 million fund so this for we be a very substantial fund and what we do over the last few month well a few month ago Ray Kurzweil and I write a op ed in the New York Times about how publish the 1918 genome be very dangerous and John Doerr and Brook and other get concerned unclear and we start look around at what the world be do about be prepare for a pandemic and we see a lot of gap and so we ask ourselves you know can we find innovative thing that will go fill this gap and Brooks tell I in a break here he say he be find so much stuff he can not sleep because there be so many great technology out there we be essentially bury and we need they you know we have one antiviral that person be talk about stockpiling that still work roughly that be Tamiflu but Tamiflu the virus be resistant it be resistant to Tamiflu we have discover with AIDS we need cocktail to work well so that the viral resistance we need several anti viral we need good surveillance we need network that can find out what be go on we need rapid diagnostic so that we can tell if somebody have a strain of flu which we have only identify very recently we have get to be able to make the rapid diagnostic quickly we need new anti viral and cocktail we need new kind of vaccine vaccine that be broad spectrum vaccine that we can manufacture quickly Cocktails more polyvalent vaccine you normally get a trivalent vaccine against three possible strain we need we do not know where this thing be go we believe that if we could fill this 10 gap we have a chance to help really reduce the risk of a pandemic and the difference between a normal flu season and a pandemic be about a factor of 1 000 in death and certainly enormous economic impact so we be very excited because we think we can fund 10 or speed up 10 project and see they come to market in the next couple year that will address this so if we can address use technology help address education help address the environment help address the pandemic do that solve the large problem that I be talk about in the Wired article and I be afraid the answer be really no because you can not solve a problem with the management of technology with more technology if we let a unlimited amount of power loose then we will a very small number of person will be able to abuse it we can not fight at a million to one disadvantage so what we need to do be we need good policy and for example some thing we could do that would be policy solution which be not really in the political air right now but perhaps with the change of administration would be use market market be a very strong force for example rather than try to regulate away problem which probably will not work if we could price into the cost of do business the cost of catastrophe so that person who be do thing that have a high cost of catastrophe would have to take insurance against that risk so if you want to put a drug on the market you could put it on but it would not have to be approve by regulator you would have to convince a actuary that it would be safe and if you apply the notion of insurance more broadly you can use a more powerful force a market force to provide feedback how could you keep the law I think the law would be a really good thing to keep well you have to hold person accountable the law require accountability today scientist technologist businessman engineer do not have any personal responsibility for the consequence of they action so if you tie that you have to tie that back with the law and finally I think we have to do something that be not really it be almost unacceptable to say this which we have to begin to design the future we can not pick the future but we can steer the future we investment in try to prevent pandemic flu be affect the distribution of possible outcome we may not be able to stop it but the likelihood that it will get past we be low if we focus on that problem so we can design the future if we choose what kind of thing we want to have happen and not have happen and steer we to a low risk place Vice President Gore will talk about how we could steer the climate trajectory into a low probability of catastrophic risk but above all what we have to do be we have to help the good guy the person on the defensive side have a advantage over the person who want to abuse thing and what we have to do to do that be we have to limit access to certain information and grow up as we have and hold very high the value of free speech this be a hard thing for we to accept for all of we to accept it be especially hard for the scientist to accept who still remember you know Galileo essentially lock up and who be still fight this battle against the church but that be the price of have a civilization the price of retain the rule of law be to limit the access to the great and kind of unbridled power thank you applause
