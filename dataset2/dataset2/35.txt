video narrator a event see from one point of view give one impression see from another point of view it give quite a different impression but it be only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand what be go on Sasha Vucinic it be a great clip be not it and I find that in 29 second it tell more about the power of and importance of independent media than I could say in a hour so I think that it will be good to start with it and also start with a little bit of statistics accord to relevant researcher 83 percent of the population of this planet live in the society without independent press think about that number 83 percent of the population on the whole planet do not really know what be go on in they country the information they get get filter through somebody who either twist that information or color that information do something with it so they be deprive of understand they reality that be just to understand how big and important this problem be now that of you who be lucky enough to live in that society that represent 17 percent I think should enjoy it until it last you know Sunday morning you flick the paper get you cappuccino enjoy it while it last because as we hear yesterday country can lose star from they flag but they can also lose press freedom as I guess American among we can tell we more about but that be totally another and separate topic so I can go back to my story my story start the story I want to share start in 1991 at that time I be run B92 the only independent for that matter the only electronic media in the country and I guess we be share we have that regular life of the only independent media in the country operate in hostile environment where government really want to make you life miserable and there be different way yeah it be the usual cocktail a little bit of threat a little bit of friendly advice a little bit of financial police a little bit of text control so you always have somebody who never leave you office but what they really do which be very powerful and that be what government in the late 90 start do if they do not like independent media company you know they threaten you advertiser once they threaten you advertiser market force be actually you know destroy and the advertiser do not want to come no matter how much do it make sense for they do not want to come and advertise and you have a problem make end meet at that time at the beginning of the 90 we have that problem which be you know survival below one side but what be really painful for I be remember the beginning of the 90 Yugoslavia be fall apart we be sit over there with a country in a downfall in a slow motion downfall and we all have all of that on tape we have the ability to understand what be go on we be actually record history the problem be that we have to be tape that history a week later because if we do not we could not afford enough tape to keep archive of that history so if I give you that picture I do not want to go too long on that in that context a gentleman come to my office at that time it be still 1991 he be run a media system organization which be still in business the gentleman be still in business and what do I know at that time about media system I would think media system be organization which mean they should help you so I prepare two plan for that meeting two strategic plan the small one and the big one the small one be I just want he to help we get that damn tape so we can keep that archive for the next 50 year the big plan be to ask he for a 1 000 000 dollar loan because I think I still maintain that serious and independent media company be great business and I think that B92 will survive and be a great company once Milosevic be go which turn out to be true it be now probably either the big or the second big media company in the country and I think that the only thing that we need at that time be 1 000 000 dollar loan to take we through that hard time to make a long story short the gentleman come into the office great suit and tie I give he what I think be a brilliant explanation of the political situation and explain how hard and difficult the war will be actually I underestimate the atrocity I have to admit anyway after that whole big long explanation the only question he have for I and this be not a joke be be we pay royalty after we broadcast music of Michael Jackson that be really the only question he have he leave and I remember be actually very angry at myself because I think there must be a institution in the world that be provide loan to media company it be so obvious straight in you face and somebody must have think of it somebody must have start something like that and I think I be just dumb and I can not find it you know in my defense there be no Google at that time you could not just Google in 91 so I think that that be actually my problem now we go from here fast forward to 1995 I have I leave the country I have a meeting with George Soros try for the third time to convince he that he foundation should invest in something that should operate like a media bank and basically what I be say be very simple you know forget about charity it do not work forget about handout 20 000 dollar do not help anybody what you should do be you should treat media company as a business it be business anywhere media business or any other business it need to be capitalize and what this guy need actually be access to capital so third meeting argument be pretty well exercise at the end of the meeting he say look it be not go to work you will never see you money back but my foundation will put 500 000 dollar so you can test the idea see that it will not work he say I will give you a rope to hang yourself laughter I know two thing after that meeting first under no circumstance I want to hang myself and second that I have no idea how to make it work you see at the level of a concept it be a great concept but it be one thing to have a concept it be a totally separate thing to actually make it work so I have absolutely no idea how that could actually work have the wrong idea I think that we can be a bank you see bank I do not know if there be any banker over here I apologize in advance but it be the good job in the world you know you find somebody who be respectable and have a lot of money you give they more money they repay you that over a time you collect interest and do nothing in between so I think why do not we get into that business laughter so here we be have we first client brilliant first independent newspaper in Slovakia the government cut they off from all the printing facility in Bratislava so here be the daily newspaper that have to be print 400 kilometer away from the capital it be a daily newspaper with a deadline of 4 p m that mean that they have no sport they have no late news circulation go down it be a kind of very nice sophisticated way how to economically strangle a daily newspaper they come to we with a request for a loan they want to the only way for they to survive be to get a printing press and we say that be fine let meet you will bring we you business plan which eventually they do we start the meeting I get this two piece of paper not like this a4 format so it be much big a lot of number there a lot of number but however you put it you know the number do not make any sense and that be the good they could do we be the good that they could do so that be how we understand what we method be it be not a bank we have to actually go into this company and earn we return by fix they by establish management system by provide all that knowledge how do you run a business on one side while they all know how to run how to create content just quickly on the result over this 10 year 40 million dollar in affordable financing average interest rate five percent to six percent lately we be go wild charge seven percent from time to time we do it in 17 country of the develop world and here be the most stunning number return rate the one that Soros be so worried about 97 percent 97 percent of all the schedule repayment come back to we on time what do we typically finance we finance anything that a media company would need from print press to transmitter what be most important be we do it either in form of loan equity lease whatever be appropriate for you know support anybody but what be most important here be who do we finance we believe that in the last 10 year company that we have finance be actually the good media company in the develop world that be a who be who list and I could spend hour talk about they because they be all kind of hero and I can but I will give you just maybe one and depend on time I may give you two example who we work with you see we start work in Eastern and Central Europe and move to Russia we first loan in Russia be in Chelyabinsk I will bet half of you have never hear of that place in the south of Russia there be a guy call Boris Nikolayevich Kirshin who be run a independent newspaper there the city be close until early 90 because of all thing they be produce glass for Tupolev plane anyway he be run independent newspaper there after two year work with we he become the most respected newspaper in that small place Governor come to he one day actually invite he to come to he office he go and see the governor the governor say Boris Nikolayevich I understand you be do a great job and you be the most respected newspaper in we district and I want to offer you a deal can you please give I you newspaper for the next nine month because I have election there be election come up in nine month I will not run but it be very important for I who be go to succeed I so give I the paper for nine month I will give it back to you I have no interest in be in media business how much would that cost Boris Nikolayevich say it be not for sale the governor say we will close you Boris Nikolayevich say no you can not do it six month later the newspaper be close luckily we have enough time to help Boris Nikolayevich take all the asset out of that company and bring he into a new one to get all the subscription list rehire staff so what the governor get be a empty shell but that be what happen if you be in business of independent media and if you be a banker for independent media so it sound like a great story somewhere down the road we open a media management center we start we media lab sound like a real great story but there be a second angle to that the second angle like in this clip if you take the camera above you start think about this number again 40 million dollar over 10 year spread over 17 country that be not too much be it it be actually just a drop in the sea because when you think about the importance some of the issue that we be talk about last night this last session we have about Africa and he hypothetical 50 billion dollar destine for Africa all of that not all half of that problem mention last night government accountability corruption how do you fight corruption give voice to unheard to poor it be why independent media be in business and it be why it be invent so from that perspective what we do be just really one drop in the sea of that need that we can identify now ours be just one story I be sure that in this room there be like 15 other wonderful story of nonprofit do spectacular work here be where the problem be and I will explain to you as well as I can what the problem be and it be call fundraising imagine that this third of this room be fill with person who represent different foundation imagine two third over here run excellent organization do very important work now imagine that every second person over here be deaf do not hear and switch the light off now that be how difficult it be to match person from this side of the room with person of that side of the room so we think that some kind of a big idea be need to reform to totally rethink fundraising you know instead of person run in this dark try to find they own match who will be willing who have the same goal instead of all of that we think there be something new need to be invent and we come up with this idea of issue bond press freedom bond if there be investor willing to finance U S government budget deficit why would not we find investor willing to finance press freedom deficit we have decide to do it this fall we will issue they probably in denomination of 1 000 dollar I do not want to advertise they too much that be not the point but the point be if we ever survive to actually issue they find enough investor that this can be consider a success there be nothing stop the next organization to start to issue bond next spring and that can be environmental bond and then two week later Iqbal Quadir can issue he electricity in Bangladesh bond and before you know it any social cause can be actually finance in this way now we do daydream in 11 30 with 55 second leave but let take the idea further you do it you start it in the States because it be you know concept be very very close to American mind but you can actually bring it to Europe too you can bring it to Asia you can once you have all of that different point you can make it easy for investor put all of that bond at one place and they sit down and click once you have more than 10 of they you have to develop some kind of a matrix what do investor get on one side financial on the other side social so that bring the idea of some kind of rating agency Morningstar type it say you know social impact over here be spectacular five star Financial they give you one percent only one star now take it to the last step once you have all of that put together there be not one reason why you could not actually have a marketplace for all of that where you can not dispose of all of that bond in a pretty quick way and in that way you organize the financing so there be no dark room no blind person run around to find each other thank you
