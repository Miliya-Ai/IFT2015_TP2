this be I my name be Ben Saunders I specialize in drag heavy thing around cold place on May 11th last year I stand alone at the North geographic Pole I be the only human be in a area one and a half time the size of America five and a half thousand square mile more than 2 000 person have climb Everest 12 person have stand on the moon include I only four person have ski solo to the North Pole and I think the reason for that applause thank you I think the reason for that be that it be it be well it be as Chris say bonker it be a journey that be right at the limit of human capability I ski the equivalent of 31 marathon back to back 800 mile in 10 week and I be drag all the food I need the supply the equipment sleeping bag one change of underwear everything I need for nearly three month laughter what we be go to try and do today in the 16 and a bit minute I have get leave be to try and answer three question the first one be why the second one be how do you go to the loo at minus 40 Ben I have read somewhere that at minus 40 expose skin become frostbitten in less than a minute so how do you answer the call of nature I do not want to answer this now I will come on to they at the end third one how do you top that what be next it all start back in 2001 my first expedition be with a guy call Pen Hadow enormously experience chap this be like my polar apprenticeship we be try to ski from this group of island up here Severnaya Zemlya to the North Pole and the thing that fascinate I about the North Pole geographic north Pole be that it be slap bang in the middle of the sea this be about as good as map get and to reach it you have get to ski literally over the frozen crust the float skin of ice on the Artic Ocean I have speak to all the expert I would read lot of book I study map and chart but I realize on the morning of day one that I have no idea exactly what I have let myself in for I be 23 year old no one my age have attempt anything like this and pretty quickly almost everything that could have go wrong do go wrong we be attack by a polar bear on day two I have frostbite in my left big toe we start run very low on food we be both pretty hungry lose lot of weight some very unusual weather condition very difficult ice condition we have decidedly low tech communication we could not afford a satellite phone so we have HF radio you can see two ski pole stick out of the roof of the tent there be a wire dangle down either side that be we HF radio antenna we have less than two hour two way communication with the outside world in two month ultimately we run out of time we have ski 400 mile we be just over 200 mile leave to go to the Pole and we would run out of time we be too late into the summer the ice be start to melt we speak to the Russian helicopter pilot on the radio and they say look boy you have run out of time we have get to pick you up and I feel that I have fail wholeheartedly I be a failure the one goal the one dream I have have for as long as I could remember I have not even come close and skiing along that first trip I have two imaginary video clip that I have replay over and over again in my mind when the go get tough just to keep my motivation go the first one be reach the Pole itself I could see vividly I suppose be film out of the door of a helicopter there be kind of rock music play in the background and I have a ski pole with a Union Jack you know fly in the wind I could see myself stick the flag in a pole you know ah glorious moment the music kind of reach a crescendo the second video clip that I imagine be get back to Heathrow airport and I could see again vividly the camera flashbulb go off the paparazzi the autograph hunter the book agent come to sign I up for a deal and of course neither of this thing happen we do not get to the Pole and we do not have any money to pay anyone to do the pr so no one have hear of this expedition and I get back to Heathrow my mum be there my brother be there my granddad be there have a little union jack laughter and that be about it I go back to live with my mum I be physically exhausted mentally a absolute wreck consider myself a failure in a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition and lie on my mum sofa day in day out watch daytime tv my brother send I a text message a sms it be a quote from the Simpsons it say you try you hard and fail miserably the lesson be do not even try laughter fast forward three year I do eventually get off the sofa and start plan another expedition this time I want to go right across on my own this time from Russia at the top of the map to the North Pole where the sort of kink in the middle be and then on to Canada no one have make a complete crossing of the Arctic Ocean on they own two Norwegian do it as a team in 2000 no one do it solo very famous very accomplished Italian mountaineer Reinhold Messner try it in 1995 and he be rescue after a week he describe this expedition as 10 time as dangerous as Everest so for some reason this be what I want to have a crack at but I know that even to stand a chance of get home in one piece let alone make it across to Canada I have to take a radical approach this mean everything from perfect the sawn off sub two gram toothbrush to work with one of the world lead nutritionist in develop a completely new revolutionary nutritional strategy from scratch 6 000 calorie a day and the expedition start in February last year big support team we have a film crew a couple of logistics person with we my girlfriend a photographer at first it be pretty sensible we fly British Airways to Moscow the next bit in Siberia to Krasnoyarsk on a Russian internal airline call KrasAir spell K R A S the next bit we have charter a pretty elderly Russian plane to fly we up to a town call Khatanga which be the sort of last bit of civilization we cameraman who it turn out be a pretty nervous flier at the good of time actually ask the pilot before we get on the plane how long this flight would take and the pilot Russian pilot completely deadpan reply six hour if we live laughter we get to Khatanga I think the joke be that Khatanga be not the end of the world but you can see it from there laughter it be suppose to be a overnight stay we be stick there for 10 day there be a kind of vodka fuel pay dispute between the helicopter pilot and the person that own the helicopter so we be stuck we could not move finally morning of day 11 we get the all clear load up the helicopter two helicopter fly in tandem drop I off at the edge of the pack ice we have a frantic sort of 45 minute of film photography while the helicopter be still there I do a interview on the satellite phone and then everyone else climb back into the helicopter wham the door closed and I be alone and I do not know if word will ever quite do that moment justice all I could think about be run back up to the door bang on the door and say look guy I have not quite think this through laughter to make thing bad you can just see the white dot up at the top right hand side of the screen that be a full moon because we have be hold up in Russia of course the full moon bring the high and low tide when you be stand on the frozen surface of the sea high and low tide generally mean that interesting thing be go to happen the ice be go to start move around a bit I be you can see there pull two sledge Grand total in all 95 day of food and fuel 180 kilo that be almost exactly 400 pound when the ice be flat or flattish I could just about pull both when the ice be not flat I do not have a hope in hell I have to pull one leave it and go back and get the other one literally scramble through what be call pressure ice the ice have be smash up under the pressure of the current of the ocean the wind and the tide NASA describe the ice condition last year as the bad since record begin and it be always drift the pack ice be always drift I be ski into headwind for nine out of the 10 week I be alone last year and I be drift backwards most of the time my record be minus 2 5 mile I get up in the morning take the tent down ski north for seven and a half hour put the tent up and I be two and a half mile further back than when I would start I literally could not keep up with the drift of the ice video so it be day 22 I be lie in the tent get ready to go the weather be just appalling oh drift back about five mile in the last last night late in the expedition the problem be no long the ice it be a lack of ice open water I know this be happen I know the Artic be warm I know there be more open water and I have a secret weapon up my sleeve this be my little bit of bio mimicry Polar bear on the Artic Ocean move in dead straight line if they come to water they will climb in swim across it so we have a dry suit develop I work with a team in Norway base on a sort of survival suit I suppose that helicopter pilot would wear that I could climb into it would go on over my boot over my mitten it would pull up around my face and seal pretty tightly around my face and this mean I could ski over very thin ice and if I fall through it be not the end of the world it also mean if the bad come to the bad I could actually jump in and swim across and drag the sledge over after I some pretty radical technology a radical approach but it work perfectly another exciting thing we do last year be with communication technology in 1912 Shackleton endurance expedition there be one of he crew a guy call Thomas Orde Lees he say the explorer of 2012 if there be anything leave to explore will no doubt carry pocket wireless telephone fit with wireless telescope well Orde Lees guess wrong by about eight year this be my pocket wireless telephone Iridium satellite phone the wireless telescope be a digital camera I have tuck in my pocket and every single day of the 72 day I be alone on the ice I be blogg live from my tent send back a little diary piece send back information on the distance I have cover the ice condition the temperature and a daily photo remember 2001 we have less than two hour radio contact with the outside world last year blogg live from a expedition that be be describe as 10 time as dangerous as Everest it be not all high tech this be navigate in what be call a whiteout when you get lot of mist low cloud the wind start blow the snow up you can not see a awful lot you can just see there be a yellow ribbon tie to one of my ski pole I would navigate use the direction of the wind so kind of a weird combination of high tech and low tech I get to the Pole on the 11th of May it take I 68 day to get there from Russia and there be nothing there laughter there be not even a pole at the Pole there be nothing there purely because it be sea ice it be drift Stick a flag there leave it there pretty soon it will drift off usually towards Canada or Greenland I know this but I be expect something strange mixture of feeling it be extremely warm by this stage a lot of open water around and of course elated that I have get there under my own steam but start to really realize that my chance of make it all the way across to Canada which be still 400 mile away be slim at well the only proof I have get that I be there be a blurry photo of my GPS the little satellite navigation gadget you can just see there be a nine and a string of zero here ninety degree north that be slap bang in the North Pole I take a photo of that Sat down on my sledge do a sort of video diary piece take a few photo I get my satellite phone out I warm the battery up in my armpit I dial three number I dial my mum I dial my girlfriend I dial the ceo of my sponsor and I get three voicemail laughter video ninety it be a special feeling the entire planet be rotate beneath my foot the the whole world underneath I I finally get through to my mum she be at the queue of the supermarket she start cry she ask I to call she back laughter I ski on for a week past the Pole I want to get as close to Canada as I could before condition just get too dangerous to continue this be the last day I have on the ice when I speak to the my project management team they say look Ben condition be get too dangerous there be huge area of open water just south of you position we would like to pick you up Ben could you please look for a airstrip this be the view outside my tent when I have this fateful phone call I have never try to build a airstrip before Tony the expedition manager he say look Ben you have get to find 500 meter of flat thick safe ice the only bit of ice I could find it take I 36 hour of skiing around try to find a airstrip be exactly 473 meter I could measure it with my ski I do not tell Tony that I do not tell the pilot that I think it will have to do video oh oh oh oh oh oh it just about work a pretty dramatic landing the plane actually pass over four time and I be a bit worried it be not go to land at all the pilot I know be call Troy I be expect someone call Troy that do this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy I be bawl my eye out by the time the plane land a pretty emotional moment so I think I have get to compose myself for Troy I be suppose to be the roughty toughty explorer type the plane taxi up to where I be stand the door open this guy jump out he be about that tall he say hi my name be Troy laughter the co pilot be a lady call Monica she sit there in a sort of hand knit jumper they be the least macho person I have ever meet but they make my day Troy be smoke a cigarette on the ice we take a few photo he climb up the ladder he say just just get in the back he throw he cigarette out as he get on the front and I climb in the back laughter taxi up and down the runway a few time just to flatten it out a bit and he say right I be go to I be go to give it a go and he I have now learn that this be standard practice but it have I worried at the time he put he hand on the throttle you can see the control for the engine be actually on the roof of the cockpit it be that little bar there he put he hand on the throttle Monica very gently put she hand sort of on top of he I think God here we go we be we be this be all or nothing ram it forwards bounce down the runway just take off one of the ski just clip a pressure ridge at the end of the runway banking I could see into the cockpit Troy battle the control and he just take one hand off reach back flip a switch on the roof of the cockpit and it be the fasten seat belt sign you can see on the wall laughter and only from the air do I see the big picture of course when you be on the ice you only ever see one obstacle at a time whether it be a pressure ridge or there be a bit of water this be probably why I do not get into trouble about the length of my airstrip I mean it really be start to break up why I be not a explorer in the traditional sense I be not ski along draw map everyone know where the North Pole be at the South Pole there be a big scientific base there be a airstrip there be a cafe and there be a tourist shop for I this be about explore human limit about explore the limit of physiology of psychology and of technology they be the thing that excite I and it be also about potential on a personal level this for I be a chance to explore the limit really push the limit of my own potential see how far they stretch and on a wide scale it amaze I how person go through life just scratch the surface of they potential just do three or four or five percent of what they be truly capable of so on a wide scale I hope that this journey be a chance to inspire other person to think about what they want to do with they potential and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time we each have on this planet that be as close as I can come to sum that up the next question be how do you answer the call of nature at minus 40 the answer of course to which be a trade secret and the last question what be next as quickly as possible if I have a minute leave at the end I will go into more detail what be next Antarctica it be the cold high windy and dry continent on Earth Late 1911 early 1912 there be a race to be the first to the South Pole the heart of the Antarctic continent if you include the coastal ice shelf you can see that the Ross Ice Shelf it be the big one down here the Ross Ice Shelf be the size of France Antarctica if you include the ice shelf be twice the size of Australia it be a big place and there be a race to get to the Pole between Amundsen the Norwegian Amundsen have dog sled and husky and Scott the British guy Captain Scott Scott have sort of pony and some tractor and a few dog all of which go wrong and Scott and he team of four person end up on foot they get to the Pole late January 1912 to find a Norwegian flag already there there be a tent a letter to the Norwegian king and they turn around head back to the coast and all five of they die on the return journey since then no one have ever ski this be 93 year ago since then no one have ever ski from the coast of Antarctica to the Pole and back every south Pole expedition you may have hear about be either fly out from the Pole or have use vehicle or dog or kite to do some kind of cross no one have ever make a return journey so that be the plan two of we be do it that be pretty much it one final thought before I get to the toilet bit be be I have a and I mean to scan this and I have forget but I have a I have a school report I be 13 year old and it be frame above my desk at home it say Ben lack sufficient impetus to achieve anything worthwhile laughter applause I think if I have learn anything it be this that no one else be the authority on you potential you be the only person that decide how far you go and what you be capable of lady and gentleman that be my story thank you very much
