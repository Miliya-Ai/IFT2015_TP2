I be a writer write book be my profession but it be more than that of course it be also my great lifelong love and fascination and I do not expect that that be ever go to change but that say something kind of peculiar have happen recently in my life and in my career which have cause I to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work and the peculiar thing be that I recently write this book this memoir call eat pray love which decidedly unlike any of my previous book go out in the world for some reason and become this big mega sensation international bestseller thing the result of which be that everywhere I go now person treat I like I be doom seriously doom doom like they come up to I now all worried and they say be not you afraid you be never go to be able to top that be not you afraid you be go to keep write for you whole life and you be never again go to create a book that anybody in the world care about at all ever again so that be reassure you know but it would be bad except for that I happen to remember that over 20 year ago when I be a teenager when I first start tell person that I want to be a writer I be meet with this same sort of fear base reaction and person would say be not you afraid you be never go to have any success be not you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you be not you afraid that you be go to work you whole life at this craft and nothing be ever go to come of it and you be go to die on a scrap heap of broken dream with you mouth fill with bitter ash of failure laughter like that you know the answer the short answer to all that question be yes yes I be afraid of all that thing and I always have be and I be afraid of many many more thing besides that person can not even guess at like seaweed and other thing that be scary but when it come to write the thing that I have be sort of think about lately and wonder about lately be why you know be it rational be it logical that anybody should be expect to be afraid of the work that they feel they be put on this earth to do and what be it specifically about creative venture that seem to make we really nervous about each other mental health in a way that other career kind of do not do you know like my dad for example be a chemical engineer and I do not recall once in he 40 year of chemical engineering anybody ask he if he be afraid to be a chemical engineer you know that chemical engineering block John how be it go it just do not come up like that you know but to be fair chemical engineer as a group have not really earn a reputation over the century for be alcoholic manic depressive laughter we writer we kind of do have that reputation and not just writer but creative person across all genre it seem have this reputation for be enormously mentally unstable and all you have to do be look at the very grim death count in the 20th century alone of really magnificent creative mind who die young and often at they own hand you know and even the one who do not literally commit suicide seem to be really undo by they gift you know Norman Mailer just before he die last interview he say every one of my book have kill I a little more a extraordinary statement to make about you life work but we do not even blink when we hear somebody say this because we have hear that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we have completely internalize and accept collectively this notion that creativity and suffering be somehow inherently link and that artistry in the end will always ultimately lead to anguish and the question that I want to ask everybody here today be be you guy all cool with that idea be you comfortable with that because you look at it even from a inch away and you know I be not at all comfortable with that assumption I think it be odious and I also think it be dangerous and I do not want to see it perpetuate into the next century I think it be good if we encourage we great creative mind to live and I definitely know that in my case in my situation it would be very dangerous for I to start sort of leak down that dark path of assumption particularly give the circumstance that I be in right now in my career which be you know like check it out I be pretty young I be only about 40 year old I still have maybe another four decade of work leave in I and it be exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward be go to be judge by the world as the work that come after the freakish success of my last book right I should just put it bluntly because we be all sort of friend here now it be exceedingly likely that my great success be behind I so Jesus what a think that be the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drink gin at nine o clock in the morning and I do not want to go there laughter I would prefer to keep do this work that I love and so the question become how and so it seem to I upon a lot of reflection that the way that I have to work now in order to continue write be that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct right I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between I as I be write and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing be go to be from now on and as I have be look over the last year for model for how to do that I have be sort of look across time and I have be try to find other society to see if they might have have good and sane idea than we have about how to help creative person sort of manage the inherent emotional risk of creativity and that search have lead I to ancient Greece and ancient Rome so stay with I because it do circle around and back but ancient Greece and ancient Rome person do not happen to believe that creativity come from human being back then ok person believe that creativity be this divine attendant spirit that come to human being from some distant and unknowable source for distant and unknowable reason the Greek famously call this divine attendant spirit of creativity daemon Socrates famously believe that he have a daemon who speak wisdom to he from afar the Roman have the same idea but they call that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius which be great because the Roman do not actually think that a genius be a particularly clever individual they believe that a genius be this sort of magical divine entity who be believe to literally live in the wall of a artist studio kind of like Dobby the house elf and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with they work and would shape the outcome of that work so brilliant there it be right there that distance that I be talk about that psychological construct to protect you from the result of you work and everyone know that this be how it function right so the ancient artist be protect from certain thing like for example too much narcissism right if you work be brilliant you could not take all the credit for it everybody know that you have this disembodied genius who have help you if you work bomb not entirely you fault you know everyone know you genius be kind of lame laughter and this be how person think about creativity in the West for a really long time and then the Renaissance come and everything change and we have this big idea and the big idea be let put the individual human be at the center of the universe above all god and mystery and there be no more room for mystical creature who take dictation from the divine and it be the beginning of rational humanism and person start to believe that creativity come completely from the self of the individual and for the first time in history you start to hear person refer to this or that artist as be a genius rather than have a genius and I get to tell you I think that be a huge error you know I think that allow somebody one mere person to believe that he or she be like the vessel you know like the font and the essence and the source of all divine creative unknowable eternal mystery be just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile human psyche it be like ask somebody to swallow the sun it just completely warp and distort ego and it create all this unmanageable expectation about performance and I think the pressure of that have be kill off we artist for the last 500 year and if this be true and I think it be true the question become what now can we do this differently maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between human and the creative mystery maybe not maybe we can not just erase 500 year of rational humanistic thought in one 18 minute speech and there be probably person in this audience who would raise really legitimate scientific suspicion about the notion of basically fairy who follow person around rub fairy juice on they project and stuff I be not probably go to bring you all along with I on this but the question that I kind of want to pose be you know why not why not think about it this way because it make as much sense as anything else I have ever hear in term of explain the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process a process which as anybody who have ever try to make something which be to say basically everyone here know do not always behave rationally and in fact can sometimes feel downright paranormal I have this encounter recently where I meet the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone who be now in she 90 but she be be a poet she entire life and she tell I that when she be grow up in rural Virginia she would be out work in the field and she say she would feel and hear a poem come at she from over the landscape and she say it be like a thunderous train of air and it would come barrel down at she over the landscape and she feel it come because it would shake the earth under she foot she know that she have only one thing to do at that point and that be to in she word run like hell and she would run like hell to the house and she would be get chase by this poem and the whole deal be that she have to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thunder through she she could collect it and grab it on the page and other time she would not be fast enough so she would be run and run and she would not get to the house and the poem would barrel through she and she would miss it and she say it would continue on across the landscape look as she put it for another poet and then there be this time this be the piece I never forget she say that there be moment where she would almost miss it right so she be run to the house and she be look for the paper and the poem pass through she and she grab a pencil just as it be go through she and then she say it be like she would reach out with she other hand and she would catch it she would catch the poem by its tail and she would pull it backwards into she body as she be transcribe on the page and in this instance the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards from the last word to the first laughter so when I hear that I be like that be uncanny that be exactly what my creative process be like laughter that be not at all what my creative process be I be not the pipeline I be a mule and the way that I have to work be I have to get up at the same time every day and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly but even I in my mulishness even I have brush up against that thing at time and I would imagine that a lot of you have too you know even I have have work or idea come through I from a source that I honestly can not identify and what be that thing and how be we to relate to it in a way that will not make we lose we mind but in fact might actually keep we sane and for I the good contemporary example that I have of how to do that be the musician Tom Waits who I get to interview several year ago on a magazine assignment and we be talk about this and you know Tom for most of he life he be pretty much the embodiment of the torment contemporary modern artist try to control and manage and dominate this sort of uncontrollable creative impulse that be totally internalize but then he get old he get calm and one day he be drive down the freeway in Los Angeles and this be when it all change for he and he be speed along and all of a sudden he hear this little fragment of melody that come into he head as inspiration often come elusive and tantalizing and he want it it be gorgeous and he long for it but he have no way to get it he do not have a piece of paper or a pencil or a tape recorder so he start to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in he like I be go to lose this thing and I will be be haunt by this song forever I be not good enough and I can not do it and instead of panic he just stop he just stop that whole mental process and he do something completely novel he just look up at the sky and he say excuse I can you not see that I be drive laughter do I look like I can write down a song right now if you really want to exist come back at a more opportune moment when I can take care of you otherwise go bother somebody else today go bother Leonard Cohen and he whole work process change after that not the work the work be still oftentimes as dark as ever but the process and the heavy anxiety around it be release when he take the genie the genius out of he where it be cause nothing but trouble and release it back where it come from and realize that this do not have to be this internalize torment thing it could be this peculiar wondrous bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between Tom and the strange external thing that be not quite Tom when I hear that story it start to shift a little bit the way that I work too and this idea already save I once it save I when I be in the middle of write eat pray love and I fall into one of that sort of pit of despair that we all fall into when we be work on something and it be not come and you start to think this be go to be a disaster the bad book ever write not just bad but the bad book ever write and I start to think I should just dump this project but then I remember Tom talk to the open air and I try it so I just lift my face up from the manuscript and I direct my comment to a empty corner of the room and I say aloud listen you thing you and I both know that if this book be not brilliant that be not entirely my fault right because you can see that I be put everything I have into this I do not have any more than this if you want it to be good you have get to show up and do you part of the deal but if you do not do that you know what the hell with it I be go to keep write anyway because that be my job and I would please like the record to reflect today that I show up for my part of the job laughter because applause because in the end it be like this ok century ago in the desert of North Africa person use to gather for this moonlight dance of sacred dance and music that would go on for hour and hour until dawn they be always magnificent because the dancer be professional and they be terrific right but every once in a while very rarely something would happen and one of this performer would actually become transcendent and I know you know what I be talk about because I know you have all see at some point in you life a performance like this it be like time would stop and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal and he be not do anything different than he have ever do 1 000 night before but everything would align and all of a sudden he would no longer appear to be merely human he would be light from within and light from below and all light up on fire with divinity and when this happen back then person know it for what it be you know they call it by its name they would put they hand together and they would start to chant Allah Allah Allah God God God that be God you know curious historical footnote when the Moors invade southern Spain they take this custom with they and the pronunciation change over the century from Allah Allah Allah to Ol ol ol which you still hear in bullfight and in flamenco dance in Spain when a performer have do something impossible and magic Allah ol ol Allah magnificent bravo incomprehensible there it be a glimpse of God which be great because we need that but the tricky bit come the next morning for the dancer himself when he wake up and discover that it be Tuesday at 11 a m and he be no long a glimpse of God he be just a aging mortal with really bad knee and maybe he be never go to ascend to that height again and maybe nobody will ever chant God name again as he spin and what be he then to do with the rest of he life this be hard this be one of the most painful reconciliation to make in a creative life but maybe it do not have to be quite so full of anguish if you never happen to believe in the first place that the most extraordinary aspect of you be come from you but maybe if you just believe that they be on loan to you from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of you life to be pass along when you be finish with somebody else and you know if we think about it this way it start to change everything this be how I have start to think and this be certainly how I have be think in the last few month as I have be work on the book that will soon be publish as the dangerously frighteningly over anticipate follow up to my freakish success and what I have to sort of keep tell myself when I get really psych out about that be do not be afraid do not be daunt just do you job continue to show up for you piece of it whatever that might be if you job be to dance do you dance if the divine cockeyed genius assign to you case decide to let some sort of wonderment be glimpse for just one moment through you effort then Ol and if not do you dance anyhow and Ol to you nonetheless I believe this and I feel that we must teach it Ol to you nonetheless just for have the sheer human love and stubbornness to keep show up thank you applause thank you applause June Cohen Ol applause
