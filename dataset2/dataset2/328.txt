so about three year ago I be in London and somebody call Howard Burton come to I and say I represent a group of person and we want to start a institute in theoretical physics we have about 120 million dollar and we want to do it well we want to be in the forefront field and we want to do it differently we want to get out of this thing where the young person have all the idea and the old person have all the power and decide what science get do it take I about 25 second to decide that that be a good idea three year later we have the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo Ontario it the most exciting job I have ever have and it the first time I have have a job where I be afraid to go away because of everything that go to happen in this week when I be here laughter but in any case what I be go to do in my little bit of time be take you on a quick tour of some of the thing that we talk about and we think about so we think a lot about what really make science work the first thing that anybody who know science and have be around science be that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method be wrong there be no method on the other hand somehow we manage to reason together as a community from incomplete evidence to conclusion that we all agree about and this be by the way something that a democratic society also have to do so how do it work well my belief be that it work because scientist be a community bind together by a ethic and here be some of the ethical principle I be not go to read they all to you because I be not in teacher mode I be in entertain amaze mode laughter but one of the principle be that everybody who be part of the community get to fight and argue as hard as they can for what they believe but we be all discipline by the understanding that the only person who be go to decide you know whether I be right or somebody else be right be the person in we community in the next generation in 30 and 50 year so it this combination of respect for the tradition and community we be in and rebellion that the community require to get anywhere that make science work and be in this process of be in a community that reason from share evidence to conclusion I believe teach we about democracy not only be there a relationship between the ethic of science and the ethic of be a citizen in democracy but there have be historically a relationship between how person think about space and time and what the cosmos be and how person think about the society that they live in and I want to talk about three stage in that evolution the first science of cosmology that be anything like science be Aristotelian science and that be hierarchical the earth be in the center then there be this crystal sphere the sun the moon the planet and finally the celestial sphere where the star be and everything in this universe have a place and Aristotle law of motion be that everything go to its natural place which be of course the rule of the society that Aristotle live in and more importantly the medieval society that through Christianity embrace Aristotle and bless it and the idea be that everything be define where something be be define with respect to this last sphere the celestial sphere outside of which be this eternal perfect realm where live God who be the ultimate judge of everything so that be both Aristotelian cosmology and in a certain sense medieval society now in the 17th century there be a revolution in think about space and time and motion and so forth of Newton and at the same time there be a revolution in social thought of John Locke and he collaborator and they be very closely associated in fact Newton and Locke be friend they way of think about space and time and motion on the one hand and a society on the other hand be closely related and let I show you in a Newtonian universe there no center thank you there be particle and they move around with respect to a fix absolute framework of space and time it meaningful to say absolutely where something be in space because that define not with respect to say where other thing be but with respect to this absolute notion of space which for Newton be God now similarly in Locke society there be individual who have certain right property in a formal sense and that be define with respect to some absolute abstract notion of right and justice and so forth which be independent of what else have happen in the society of who else there be of the history and so forth there be also a omniscient observer who know everything who be God who be in a certain sense outside the universe because he have no role in anything that happen but be in a certain sense everywhere because space be just the way that God know where everything be accord to Newton OK so this be the foundation of what call traditionally liberal political theory and Newtonian physics now in the 20th century we have a revolution that be initiate at the beginning of the 20th century and which be still go on it be begin with the invention of relativity theory and quantum theory and merge they together to make the final quantum theory of space and time and gravity be the culmination of that something that go on right now and in this universe there nothing fixed and absolute zilch ok this universe be describe by be a network of relationship space be just one aspect so there no meaning to say absolutely where something be there only where it be relative to everything else that be and this network of relation be ever evolve so we call it a relational universe all property of thing be about this kind of relationship and also if you be embed in such a network of relationship you view of the world have to do with what information come to you through the network of relation and there no place for a omniscient observer or a outside intelligence know everything and make everything so this be general relativity this be quantum theory this be also if you talk to legal scholar the foundation of new idea in legal thought they be think about the same thing and not only that they make the analogy to relativity theory and cosmology often so there a interesting discussion go on there this last view of cosmology be call the relational view so the main slogan here be that there nothing outside the universe which mean that there no place to put a explanation for something outside so in such a relational universe if you come upon something that order and structure like this device here or that device there or something beautiful like all the live thing all of you guy in the room guy in physics by the way be a generic term man and woman laughter then you want to know you be a person you want to know how be it make and in a relational universe the only possible explanation be somehow it make itself there must be mechanism of self organization inside the universe that make thing because there no place to put a maker outside as there be in the Aristotelian and the Newtonian universe so in a relational universe we must have process of self organization now Darwin teach we that there be process of self organization that suffice to explain all of we and everything we see so it work but not only that if you think about how natural selection work then it turn out that natural selection would only make sense in such a relational universe that be natural selection work on property like fitness which be about relationship of some species to some other species Darwin would not make sense in a Aristotelian universe and would not really make sense in a Newtonian universe so a theory of biology base on natural selection require a relational notion of what be the property of biological system and if you push that all the way down really it make the good sense in a relational universe where all property be relational now not only that but Einstein teach we that gravity be the result of the world be relational if it be not for gravity there would not be life because gravity cause star to form and live for a very long time keep piece of the world like the surface of the Earth out of thermal equilibrium for billion of year so life can evolve in the 20th century we see the independent development of two big theme in science in the biological science they explore the implication of the notion that order and complexity and structure arise in a self organize way that be the triumph of neo darwinism and so forth and slowly that idea be leak out to the cognitive science the human science economics et cetera at the same time we physicist have be busy try to make sense of and build on and integrate the discovery of quantum theory and relativity and what we have be work out be the implication really of the idea that the universe be make up of relation 21st century science be go to be drive by the integration of this two idea the triumph of relational way of think about the world on the one hand and self organization or darwinian way of think about the world on the other hand and also be that in the 21st century we think about space and time and cosmology and we think about society be both go to continue to evolve and what they be evolve towards be the union of this two big idea darwinism and relationalism now if you think about democracy from this perspective a new pluralistic notion of democracy would be one that recognize that there be many different interest many different agenda many different individual many different point of view each one be incomplete because you be embed in a network of relationship any actor in a democracy be embed in a network of relationship and you understand some thing good than other thing and because of that there a continual jostle and give and take which be politics and politics be in the ideal sense the way in which we continually address we network of relation in order to achieve a good life and a good society and I also think that science will never go away and I be finish on this line laughter in fact I be finished Science will never go away
