I would like to start tonight by something completely different ask you to join I by step off the land and jumping into the open ocean for a moment 90 percent of the live space on the planet be in the open ocean and it be where life the title of we seminar tonight it be where life begin and it be a lively and a lovely place but we be rapidly change the ocean with we not only with we overfish we irresponsible fishing we add of pollutant like fertilizer from we cropland but also most recently with climate change and Steve Schneider I be sure will be go into great detail on this now as we continue to tinker with the ocean more and more report be predict that the kind of sea that we be create will be conducive to low energy type of animal like jellyfish and bacterium and this might be the kind of sea we be head for now jellyfish be strangely hypnotic and beautiful and you will see lot of gorgeous one at the aquarium on Friday but they sting like hell and jellyfish sushi and sashimi be just not go to fill you up about 100 gram of jellyfish equal four calorie so it may be good for the waistline but it probably will not keep you satiate for very long and a sea that be just fill and teem with jellyfish be not very good for all the other creature that live in the ocean that be unless you eat jellyfish and this be this voracious predator launch a sneak attack on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there a by the wind sailor and that predator be the giant ocean sunfish the Mola mola whose primary prey be jellyfish this animal be in the Guinness World Book of Records for be the world heavy bony fish it reach up to almost 5 000 pound on a diet of jellyfish primarily and I think it be kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here that the Mola mola its common name be sunfish that its favorite food be the moon jelly so it be kind of nice the sun and the moon get together this way even if one be eat the other now this be typically how you see sunfish this be where they get they common name they like to sunbathe can not blame they they just lay out on the surface of the sea and most person think they be sick or lazy but that be a typical behavior they lie out and bask on the surface they other name Mola mola be it sound hawaiian but it be actually latin for millstone and that be attributable to they roundish very bizarre cut off shape it be as if as they be grow they just forget the tail part and that be actually what draw I to the Mola in the first place be this terribly bizarre shape you know you look at shark and they be streamline and they be sleek and you look at tuna and they be like torpedo they just give away they agenda they be about migration and strength and then you look at the sunfish laughter and this be just so elegantly mysterious it be just it really kind of hold its card a lot tight than say a tuna so I be just intrigue with what you know what be this animal story well as with anything in biology nothing really make sense except in the light of evolution the Mola no exception they appear shortly after the dinosaur disappear 65 million year ago at a time when whale still have leg and they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction oblige I a little Kipling esque storytelling here of course evolution be somewhat random and you know about 55 million year ago there be this rebellious little puffer fish faction that say oh the heck with the coral reef we be go to head to the high sea and lot of generation lot of tweaking and torquing and we turn we puffer into the Mola you know if you give Mother Nature enough time that be what she will produce they look maybe they look kind of prehistoric and unfinished abridged perhaps but in fact in fact they be the they vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily derive fish in the sea right up there with flat fish they be every single thing about that fish have be change and in term of fish fish appear 500 million year ago and they be pretty modern just 50 million year ago so so interestingly they give away they ancestry as they develop they start as little egg and they be in the Guinness World Book of Records again for have the most number of egg of any vertebrate on the planet a single four foot female have 300 million egg can carry 300 million egg in she ovary imagine and they get to be over 10 foot long imagine what a 10 foot one have and from that little egg they pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage reminiscent of they ancestry and develop this be they little adolescent stage they school as adolescent and become behemoth loner as adult that be a little diver up there in the corner they be in the Guinness World Book of Records again for be the vertebrate growth champion of the world from they little hatching size of they egg into they little larval stage till they reach adulthood they put on 600 million time a increase in weight 600 million now imagine if you give birth to a little baby and you have to feed this thing that would mean that you child you would expect it to gain the weight of six titanic now I do not know how you would feed a child like that but we do not know how fast the Molas grow in the wild but captive growth study at the Monterey Bay Aquarium one of the first place to have they in captivity they have one that gain 800 lb in 14 month I say now that be a true American laughter applause so be a loner be a great thing especially in today sea because school use to be salvation for fish but it be suicide for fish now but unfortunately Molas even though they do not school they still get catch in net as by catch if we be go to save the world from total jellyfish domination then we have get to figure out what the jellyfish predator how they live they life like the Mola and unfortunately they make up a large portion of the California by catch up to 26 percent of the drift net and in the Mediterranean in the swordfish net fishery they make up up to 90 percent so we have get to figure out how they be live they life and how do you do that how do you do that with a animal very few place in the world this be a open ocean creature it know no boundary it do not go to land how do you get insight how do you seduce a open ocean creature like that to spill its secret well there be some great new technology that have just recently become available and it be just a boon for get insight into open ocean animal and it be picture right here that little tag up there that little tag can record temperature depth and light intensity which be correlate with time and from that we can get location and it can record this data for up to two year and keep it in that tag release at a pre program time float to the surface upload all that datum that whole travelogue to satellite which relay it directly to we computer and we have get that whole dataset and we do not even have we just have to tag the animal and then we go home and you know sit at we desk so the great thing about the Mola be that when we put the tag on they if you look up here that be stream off that be right where we put the tag and it just so happen that be a parasite hang off the Mola Molas be infamous for carry ton of parasite they be just parasite hotel even they parasite have parasite I think Donne write a poem about that but they have 40 genus of parasite and so we figure just one more parasite will not be too much of a problem and they happen to be a very good vehicle for carry oceanographic equipment they do not seem to mind so far so what be we try to find out we be focus on the Pacific we be tag on the California coast and we be tag over in Taiwan and Japan and we be interested in how this animal be use the current use temperature use the open ocean to live they life we have love to tag in Monterey Monterey be one of the few place in the world where Molas come in large number not this time of year it be more around October and we would love to tag here this be a aerial shot of Monterey but unfortunately the Molas here end up look like this because another one of we local really like Molas but in the wrong way the California sea lion take the Molas as soon as they come into the bay rip off they fin fashion they into the ultimate Frisbee Mola style and then toss they back and forth and I be not exaggerate it be just and sometimes they do not eat they it be just spiteful and you know the local think it be terrible behavior it be just horrible watch this happen day after day the poor little Molas come in get rip to shred so we head down south to San Diego not so many California sea lion down there and the Molas there you can find they with a spotter plane very easily and they like to hang out under float raft of kelp and under that kelp this be why the Molas come there because it be spa time for the Molas there as soon as they get under that raft of kelp the exfoliating cleaner fish come and they come and give the Molas you can see they strike this funny little position that say I be not threaten but I need a massage laughter and they will put they fin out and they eye go in the back of they head and the fish come up and they just clean clean clean because the Molas you know there be just a smorgasbord of parasite and it be also a great place to go down south because the water warm and the Molas be kind of friendly down there I mean what other kind of fish if you approach it right will say okay scratch I right there you truly can swim up to a Mola they be very gentle and if you approach they right you can give they a scratch and they enjoy it so we have also tag one part of the Pacific we have go over to another part of the Pacific and we have tag in Taiwan and we tag in Japan and over in this place the Molas be catch in set net that line this country and they be not throw back as by catch they be eat we be serve a nine course meal of Mola after we tag well not the one we tag and everything from the kidney to the testis to the back bone to the fin muscle to I think that be pretty much the whole fish be eat so the hard part of tag now be after you put that tag on you have to wait month and you be just wonder oh I hope the fish be safe I hope I hope it be go to be able to actually live its life out during the course that the tag be record the tag cost 3500 dollar each and then satellite time be another 500 dollar so you be like oh I hope the tag be okay and so the waiting be really the hard part I be go to show you we late dataset and it have not be publish so it be totally privy information just for TED and in show you this you know when we be look at this data we be think oh do this animal do they cross the equator do they go from one side of the Pacific to the other and we find that they kind of be homebody they be not big migrator this be they track we deploy the tag off of Tokyo and the Mola in one month kind of get into the Kuroshio Current off of Japan and forage there and after four month go up you know off of the north part of Japan and that be kind of they home range now that be important though because if there be a lot of fishing pressure that population do not get replenish so that be a very important piece of datum but also what be important be that they be not slacker lazy fish they be super industrious and this be a day in the life of a Mola and if we they be up and down and up and down and up and down and up and up and down up to 40 time a day as the sun come up you see in the blue they start they dive down and as the sun get bright they go a little deep little deep they plumb the depths down to 600 meter in temperature to one degree centigrade and this be why you see they on the surface it be so cold down there they have get to come up warm get that solar power and then plunge back into the depths and go up and down and up and down and they be hit a layer down there it be call the deep scatter layer which a whole variety of food in that layer so rather than just be some sunbathe slacker they be really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance between the surface and the bottom and through temperature we see the same pattern now with this tag we be see a similar pattern for swordfish manta ray tuna a real three dimensional play this be part of a much large program call the Census of Marine Life where they be go to be tag all over the world and the Mola be go to enter into that and what be exciting you all travel and you know the good thing about travel be to be able to find the local and to find the great place by get the local knowledge well now with the Census of Marine Life we will be able to sidle up to all the local and explore 90 percent of we live space with local knowledge it be never it be really never be a more exciting or a vital time to be a biologist which bring I to my last point and what I think be kind of the most fun I set up a website because I be get so many question about Molas and sunfish and so I just figure I would have the question answer and I would be able to thank my funder like National Geographic and Lindbergh but person would write into the site with all sort of all sort of story about this animal and want to help I get sample for genetic analysis and what I find most exciting be that everyone have a share a share love and a interest in the ocean I be get report from catholic nun Jewish Rabbis Muslim Christian everybody writing in unite by they love of life and to I that I do not think I could say it any good than the immortal Bard himself one touch of nature make the whole world kin and sure it may be just one big old silly fish but it be help if it be help to unite the world I think it be definitely the fish of the future
