so what be image get do with it and I must say I think Emeka be try to send a lot of subliminal message because I be go to keep harp on some of the issue that have come up but I be go to try and do something different and try and just close the loop with some of my personal story and try and put a face to a lot of the issue that we have be talk about so Africa be a complex continent full of contradiction as you can see we be not the only one laughter applause and you know it be amazing I mean we need a whole conference just devote to tell the good story about the continent just think about that you know and this be typically what we have be talk about the role that the media play in focus just on the negative stuff now why be that a problem a typical disaster story disease corruption poverty and some of you might be stand here think say ok you know Ory you be Harvard educate and all you privileged person come here say forget the poor person let focus on business and the market and whatever and they be all there be the 80 percent of African who really need help and I want to tell you that this be my story ok and it be the story of many of the African who be here we start with poverty I do not grow up in the slum or anything that dire but I know what it be to grow up without have money or be able to support family Euvin be talk about bellwether sign the bellwether for whether we family be broke or not be breakfast you know when thing be good we have egg and sausages when thing be bad we have porridge and like many African family my parent could never save because they support sibling cousin you know they parent and thing be always dicey now when I be bear they realize they have a pretty smart kid and they do not want I to go to the neighborhood school which be free and they adopt a very interesting approach to education which be they be go to take I to a school that they can barely afford so they take I to a private catholic elementary school which set the foundation for what end up be my career and what happen be because they could afford it sometimes sometimes not I get kick out pretty much every term you know someone would come in with a list of the person who have not pay school fee and when they start get pretty strict you have to leave until you school fee could be pay and I remember think I mean why do not this guy just take I to a cheap school because you know as a kid you be embarrassed and you be sensitive and everyone know you guy do not have money but they keep at it and I now understand why they do what they do they talk about corruption in Kenya we have a entrance exam to go into high school and there be national school which be like the good school and provincial school my dream school at that time be Kenya High School a national school I miss the cutoff by one point and I be so disappointed and I be like oh my God you know what be I go to do and my father say ok listen let go and try and talk to the headmistress you know it be just one point I mean maybe she will let you in if that slot still there so we go to the school and because we be nobody and because we do not have privilege and because my father do not have the right last name he be treat like dirt and I sit and listen to the headmistress talk to he say you know who do you think you be and you know you must be joke if you think you can get a slot and I have go to school with other girl who be kid of politician and who have do much much bad than I do and they have slot there and there be nothing bad than see you parent be humiliate in front of you you know and we leave and I swear to myself and I be like I be never ever go to have to beg for anything in my life they call I two week later they be like oh yeah you can come now and I tell they to stuff it laughter applause final story and I sort of have to speak quickly Disease my father who I have be talk about die of AIDS in 1999 he never tell anyone that he have AIDS he fear of the stigma be so strong and I be pretty much the one who figure it out because I be a nerd and I be in the States at the time and they call I he be very sick the first time he get sick and he have cryptococcal meningitis and so I go on to Google Cryptococcal meningiti you know because of doctor patient privilege they could not really tell we what be go on but they be like you know this be a long term thing and when I go online and look at the infectious read about the disease I pretty much realize what be go on the first time he get sick he recover but what happen be that he have to be on medication that at that time diflucan which in the States be use for yeast infection cost 30 dollar a pill he have to be on that pill for the rest of he life you know so money run out he get sick again and up until that time he have a friend who use to travel to India and he use to import bring he could get he a generic version of it and that keep he go but the money run out he get sick again he get sick on a Friday at that time there be only one bank that have atm in Kenya and we could not get cash the family could not get cash for he to start the treatment until Monday the hospital put he on a water drip for three day and finally we figure well ok we would better just try and take he to a public hospital at least he will get treat while we try to figure out the money situation and he die when the ambulance be come to the hospital to take he and you know now imagine if and I could go on and on imagine if this be all you know about I how would you look at I with pity you know sadness and this be how you look at Africa this be the damage it cause you do not see the other side of I you do not see the blogger you do not see the Harvard educate lawyer the vibrant person you know and I just want to personalize that because we talk about it in big term and you wonder you know so what but it be damage and I be not unique right imagine if all you know about William be the fact that he grow up in a poor village and you do not know about the windmill you know and I be just move I be actually cry during he presentation he be like I try and I make I be like Nike should hire he you know just do it laughter and this be again the point I be try to make when you focus just on the disaster laughter applause we be ignore the potential so what be to be do first of all African we need to get good at tell we story we hear about that yesterday we have some of they this morning and this be a example you know blogg be one way of do that Afrigator be a aggregator of African blog that be develop in South Africa so we need to start get good if no one else will tell we story let do it and go back to the point I be try to make this be the Swahili Wikipedia Swahili be speak by about 50 million person in East Africa it only have five contributor four of they be white male non native speaker the other person be Ndesanjo if you be here stand up be a Tanzanian the first Swahili blogger he be the only African who be contribute to this People please we can not whine and complain the West be do this what be we do where be the rest of the Swahili speaker why be we not generate we own content you know it be not enough to complain we need to act Reuters now integrate African blog into they coverage of Africa so that be a start and we have hear of all they other initiative the cheetah generation the aid approach you know be flawed and after all the hoopla of live 8 we be still not anywhere in the picture no you be not laughter but the point I be try to make though be that it be not enough for we to criticize and for that of you in the diaspora who be struggle with where should I be should I move back should I stay you know just jump the continent need you and I can not emphasize that enough you know I walk away from a job with one of the top firm in D C Covington and Burling six figure with two paycheck or three paycheck I could solve a lot of my family problem but I walk away from that because my passion be here and because I want to do thing that be fulfil and because I be need here you know I probably can win a prize for the most way to use a Harvard Law School degree because of all the thing I be do one be because I be pretty aggressive and I try and find you know opportunity but there be such a need you know I be a corporate lawyer most of the time for a organization call Enablis that support entrepreneur in South Africa we be now move into East Africa and we give they business development service as well as financing loan and equity I have also set up a project in Kenya and what we do be we track the performance of Kenyan mp my partner m who be a tech guru hack WordPress it cost we like 20 dollar a month just for host everything else on there be a labor of love we have manually enter all the datum there and you can get profile of each MP question they have ask in parliament we have a comment function where person can ask they mp question there be some mp who participate and come back and ask and basically we start this because we be tired of complain about we politician you know I believe that accountability stem from demand you be not just go to be accountable out of the goodness of you heart and we as African need to start challenge we leader what be they do you know they be not go to change just out of nowhere so we need new policy we need where be that come from you know another thing be that this leader be a reflection of we society we talk about African government like they have be drop from Mars you know they come from we and what be it about we society that be generate leader that we do not like and how can we change that so Mzalendo be one small way we think we could start inspire person to start hold they leader accountable where do we go from here I believe in the power of idea I believe in the power of share knowledge and I would ask all of you when you leave here please just share and keep the idea that you have get out of here go because it can make a difference the other thing I want to urge you to do be take a interest in the individual I have have lot of conversation about thing I think need to be happen in Africa People be like ok if you do not do aid I be a bleeding heart liberal what can I do and when I talk about my idea they be like BBut it be not scalable you know give I something I can do with Paypal it be not that easy you know and sometimes just take a interest in the individual in the fellow you have meet and the businessperson you have meet it can make a huge difference especially in Africa because usually the individual in Africa carry a lot of person behind they practically I mean when I be a first year student in law school my mom business have collapse so I be support she my sister be struggle to get through undergrad I be help she pay she tuition my cousin run out of school fee and she be really smart I be pay she school fee a cousin of mine die of AIDS leave a orphan so we say well what be we go to do with she you know she be now my baby sister and because of the opportunity that be afford to I I be able to lift all that person so do not underestimate that a example this man change my life he be a professor he be now at Vanderbilt he be a undergrad professor Mitchell Seligson and because of he I get into Harvard Law School because he take a interest I be take a class of he and he be just like this be a overeager student which we do not normally get in the United States because everyone else be cynical and jaded he call I to he office and say what do you want to do when you grow up I say I want to be a lawyer and he be like why you know we do not need another lawyer in the United States and he try to talk I out of it but it be like ok I know nothing about apply to law school I be poli sci ph d but you know let figure out what I need you to do what I need to do to help you out it be like where do you want to go and to I at that time university I be at University of Pitts for undergrad and that be like heaven OK because compare to what could have be in Kenya so I be like yeah I be just apply to Pitt for law school he be like why you know you be smart you have all this thing go for you and I be like because I be here and it be cheap and you know I kind of like Pittsburgh like that be the dumb reason I have ever hear for apply to law school and you know so he take I under he wing and he encourage I and he say look you can get into Harvard you be that good ok and if they do not admit you they be the one who be mess up and he build I up you know and this be just a illustration you can meet other individual here we just need a push that be all I need be a push to go to the next level basically I want to end with my vision for Africa you know a gentleman speak yesterday about the indignity of we have to leave the continent so that we can fulfill we potential you know my vision be that my daughter and any other African child be bear today can be whoever they want to be here without have to leave and they can have the possibility of transcend the circumstance under which they be bear that be one thing you American take for grant you know that you can grow up you know not so good circumstance and you can move just because you be bear in rural Arkansas whatever that do not define who you be for most African today where you live or where you be bear and the circumstance under which you be bear determine the rest of you life I would like to see that change and the change start with we and as African we need to take responsibility for we continent thank you applause
