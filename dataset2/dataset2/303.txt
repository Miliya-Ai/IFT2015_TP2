I want to take you back basically to my hometown and to a picture of my hometown of the week that Emergence come out and it be a picture we have see several time basically Emergence be publish on 9 11 I live right there in the West Village so the plume be luckily blow west away from we we have a two and a half day old baby in the house that be ours we have not take it from somebody else laughter and one of the thought that I have deal with this two separate emergence of a book and a baby and have this event happen so close that my first thought when I be still kind of in the apartment look out at it all or walk out on the street and look out on it just in front of we building be that I would make a terrible miscalculation in the book that I would just write because so much of that book be a celebration of the power and creative potential of density of largely urban density of connect person and put they together in one place and put they on sidewalk together and have they share idea and share physical space together and it seem to I look at that that tower burn and then fall that tower burn and fall that in fact one of the lesson here be that density kill and that of all the technology that be exploit to make that carnage come into be probably the single group of technology that cost the most life be that that enable 50 000 person to live in two building 110 story above the ground if they have not be crowd you compare the loss of life at the Pentagon to the Twin Towers and you can see that very powerfully and so I start to think well you know density density I be not sure if you know this be the right call and I kind of ruminate on that for a couple of day and then about two day late the wind start to change a little bit and you could sense that the air be not healthy and so even though there be no car still in the West Village where we live my wife send I out to buy a you know a large air filter at the Bed bath and beyond which be locate about 20 block away north and so I go out and obviously I be physically a very strong person as you can tell laughter so I be not worry about carry this thing 20 block and I walk out and this really miraculous thing happen to I as I be walk north to buy this air filter which be that the street be completely alive with person there be a incredible it be you know a beautiful day as it be for about a week after and the West Village have never seem more lively I walk up along Hudson Street where Jane Jacobs have live and write she great book that so influence what I be write in Emergence past the white horse tavern that great old bar where Dylan Thomas drink himself to death and the Bleecker Street playground be fill with kid and all the person who live in the neighborhood who own restaurant and bar in the neighborhood be all out there have they all open person be out there be no car so it seem even well in some way and it be a beautiful urban day and the incredible thing about it be that the city be work the city be there all the thing that make a great city successful and all the thing that make a great city stimulate they be all on display there on that street and I think well this be the power of a city I mean the power of the city we talk about city as be centralize in space but what make they so strong most of the time be they be decentralize in function they do not have a center executive branch that you can take out and cause the whole thing to fail if they do it probably be right there at Ground Zero I mean you know the emergency bunker be right there be destroy by the attack and obviously the damage do to the building and the life but nonetheless just 20 block north two day late the city have never look more alive if you would go into the mind of the person well you would have see a lot of trauma and you would have see a lot of heartache and you would have see a lot of thing that would take a long time to recover but the system itself of this city be thrive so I take heart in see that so I want to talk a little bit about the reason why that work so well and how some of that reason kind of map on to where the web be go right now the question that I find myself ask to person when I be talk about the book afterwards be when you have talk about emergent behavior when you have talk about collective intelligence the good way to get person to kind of wrap they head around that be to ask who build a neighborhood who decide that Soho should have this personality and that the latin quarter should have this personality well there be some kind of executive decision but mostly the answer be everybody and nobody everybody contribute a little bit no single person be really the ultimate actor behind the personality of a neighborhood same thing to the question of who be keep the street alive post 9 11 in my neighborhood well it be the whole city the whole system kind of work on it and everybody contribute a small little part and this be increasingly what we be start to see on the web in a bunch of interesting way most of which be not around actually except in very experimental thing when I be write emergence and when the book come out so it be be a very optimistic time I think and I want to just talk about a few of that thing I think that there be effectively a new kind of model of interactivity that be start to emerge online right now and the old one look like this this be not the future King of England although it look like it it be some guy it be a GeoCities homepage of some guy that I find online who be interested if you look at the bottom in soccer and Jesus and Garth Brooks and Clint Beckham and my hometown that be he link but nothing really say this model of interactivity which be so exciting and capture the real the web zeitgeist of 1995 than click here for a picture of my dog that be you know there be no sentence that kind of conjure up that period good than that I think which be that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of you dog and link to it and somebody read the page have the power to click on that link or not click on that link and you know I do not want to belittle that that in a sense to reference what Jeff be talk about yesterday that be in a sense the kind of interface electricity that power a lot of the explosion of interest in the web that you could put up a link and somebody could click on it and it could take you anywhere you want to go but it be still a very one to one kind of relationship there be one person put up the link and there be another person on the other end try to decide whether to click on it or not the new model be much more like this and we have already see a couple of reference to this this be what happen when you search Steven Johnson on Google about two month ago I have the great breakthrough one of my great kind of shine achievement which be that my website finally become a top result for Steven Johnson there be some theoretical physicist at MIT name Steven Johnson who have drop two spot I be happy to say laughter and you know I mean I will look at a couple of thing like this but Google be obviously the great technology ever invent for navel gaze it be just that there be so many other person in you navel when you gaze because effectively what be happen here what be create this page obviously and we all know this but it be worth just think about it be not some person decide that I be the number one answer for Steven Johnson but rather somehow the entire web of person put up page and decide to link to my page or not link to it and Google just sit there and run the number so there be this collective decision make that be go on this page be effectively collectively author by the web and Google be just help we kind of to put the authorship in one kind of coherent place now they be more innovative well Google pretty innovative but there be some new twist on this there be this incredibly interesting new site Technorati that be fill with lot of little widget that be expand on this and this be look in the blog world and the world of weblog he be analyze basically all the weblog out there that he be track and he be track how many other weblog link to that weblog and so you have kind of a authority a weblog that have a lot of link to it be more authoritative than a weblog that have few link to it and so at any give time on any give page on the web actually you can say what do the weblog community think about this page and you can get a list this be what they think about my site it be rank by blog authority you can also rank it by the late post so when I be talk in Emergence I talk about the limitation of the one way link architecture that basically you could link to somebody else but they would not necessarily know that you be point to they and that be one of the reason why the web be not quite as emergent as it could be because you need two way link you need that kind of feedback mechanism to be able to really do interesting thing well something like Technorati be supply that now what be interesting here be that this be a quote from Dave Weinberger where he talk about everything be purposive in the web there be nothing artificial he have this line where he say you know you be go to put up a link there if you see a link somebody decide to put it there and he say the link to one site do not just grow on the other page like a tree fungus and in fact I think that be not entirely true anymore I could put up a feed of all that link generate by Technorati on the right hand side of my page and they would change as the overall ecology of the web change that little list there would change I would not really be directly in control of it so it be much close in a way to a data fungus in a sense wrap around that page than it be to a deliberate link that I have place there now what you be have here be basically a global brain that you be able to do lot of kind of experiment on to see what it be think and there be all this interesting tool Google do the Google Zeitgeist which look at search request to test what be go on what person be interested in and they publish it with lot of fun graph and I be say a lot of nice thing about Google so I will be I will be say one little critical thing there be a problem with the Google Zeitgeist which be it often come back with news that a lot of person be search for Britney Spears picture which be not necessarily news the Columbia blow up suddenly there be a lot of search on Columbia well you know we should expect to see that that be not necessarily something we do not know already so the key thing in term of this new tool that be kind of plumbing the depths of the global brain that be send kind of trace dye through that whole bloodstream the question be be you find out something new and one of the thing that I experiment with be this thing call Google share which be basically you take a abstract term and you search Google for that term and then you search the result that you get back for somebody name so basically the number of page that mention this term that also mention this page the percentage of that page be that person Google share of that term so you can do kind of interesting contest like for instance this be a Google share of the TED Conference so Richard Saul Wurman have about a 15 percent Google share of the TED conference we good friend Chris have about a six percent but with a bullet I might add laughter but the interesting thing be you can broaden the search a little bit and it turn out actually that 42 percent be the Mola mola fish I have no idea no that be not true laughter I make that up because I just want to put up a slide of the Mola mola fish laughter I also do and I do not want to start a little fight in the next panel but I do a Google share analysis of evolution and natural selection so right here now this be a big category you have small percentage so this be 0 7 percent Dan Dennett who will be speak shortly right below he 0 5 percent Steven Pinker so Dennett in the lead a little bit there but what be interesting be you can then broaden the search and actually see interesting thing and get a sense of what else be out there so Gary Bauer be not too far behind have slightly different theory about evolution and natural selection and right behind he be L Ron Hubbard so laughter you can see we be in the ascot which be always good and by the way Chris that would have be a really good panel I think right there laughter Hubbard apparently start to reach but besides that I think it would be good next year another quick thing this be a slightly different thing but this analysis some of you may have see it just come out this be bursty word look at the historical record of state of the Union Addresses so this be word that suddenly start to appear out of nowhere so they be kind of you know meme that start take off that do not have a lot of historical precedent before so the first one be this be the bursty word around 1860 slave emancipation slavery rebellion Kansas that be Britney Spears I mean you know ok interesting they be talk about slavery in 1860 1935 relief depression recovery bank and ok I do not learn anything new there as well that be pretty obvious 1985 right at the center of the Reagan year that be we be there be we have it be laughter now there be one way to interpret this which be to say that emancipation and depression and recovery all have a lot of syllable so you know you can actually download it be hard to remember that but seriously actually what you can see there in a way that would be very hard to detect otherwise be Reagan reinvent the political language of the country and shift to a much more intimate much more folksy much more telegenic contracting all that verb you know 20 year before it be still ask not what you can do but with Reagan it be that be where there be Nancy and I that kind of language and so something we kind of know but you do not actually notice syntactically what he be do I will go very quickly the question now and this be the really interesting question be what kind of high level shape be emerge right now in the overall web ecosystem and particularly in the ecosystem of the blog because they be really kind of at the cut edge and I think what happen there will also happen in the wide system now there be a very interesting article by Clay Shirky that get a lot of attention about a month ago and this be basically the distribution of link on the web to all this various different blog it follow a power law so that there be a few extremely well link to popular blog and a long tail of blog with very few link so 20 percent of the blog get 80 percent of the link now this be a very interesting thing it be cause a lot of controversy because person think that this be the ultimate kind of one man one modem democracy where anybody can get out there and get they voice hear and so the question be why be this happen it be not be impose by fiat from above it be a emergent property of the blogosphere right now now what be great about it be that person be work on within second of clay publishing this piece person start work on change the underlying rule of the system so that a different shape would start appear and basically the shape appear largely because of a kind of a first mover advantage if you be the first site there everybody link to you if you be the second site there most person link to you and so very quickly you can accumulate a bunch of link and it make it more likely for newcomer to link to you in the future and then you get this kind of shape and so what Dave Sifry at Technorati start work on literally as Shirky start after he publish he piece be something that basically just give a new kind of priority to newcomer and he start look at interesting newcomer that do not have a lot of link that suddenly get a bunch of link in the last 24 hour so in a sense bursty weblog come from new voice so he be work on a tool right there that can actually change the overall system and it create a kind of plan emergence you be not totally in control but you be change the underlying rule in interesting way because you have a end result which be maybe a more democratic spread of voice so the most amazing thing about this and I will end on this note be most emergent system most self organize system be not make up of component part that be capable of look at the overall pattern and change they behavior base on whether they like the pattern or not so the most wonderful thing I think about this whole debate about power law and software that could change it be the fact that we be have the conversation I hope it continue here thanks a lot
