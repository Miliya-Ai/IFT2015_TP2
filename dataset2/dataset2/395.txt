I be speak to a group of about 300 kid age six to eight at a child museum and I bring with I a bag full of leg similar to the kind of thing you see up here and have they lay out on a table for the kid and from my experience you know kid be naturally curious about what they do not know or do not understand or be foreign to they they only learn to be frightened of that difference when a adult influence they to behave that way and maybe censor that natural curiosity or you know rein in the question ask in the hope of they be polite little kid so I just picture a first grade teacher out in the lobby with this unruly kid say now whatever you do do not stare at she leg but of course that be the point that be why I be there I want to invite they to look and explore so I make a deal with the adult that the kid could come in without any adult for two minute on they own the door open the kid descend on this table of leg and they be poke and prod and they be wiggle toe and they be try to put they full weight on the sprinting leg to see what happen with that and I say kid really quickly I wake up this morning I decide I want to be able to jump over a house nothing too big two or three story but if you could think of any animal any superhero any cartoon character anything you can dream up right now what kind of leg would you build I and immediately a voice shout Kangaroo no no no should be a frog no it should be go go Gadget no no no it should be the Incredibles and other thing that I do not be not familiar with and then one eight year old say hey why would not you want to fly too and the whole room include I be like yeah laughter and just like that I go from be a woman that this kid would have be train to see as disabled to somebody that have potential that they body do not have yet somebody that might even be super abled interesting so some of you actually see I at TED 11 year ago and there be be a lot of talk about how life change this conference be for both speaker and attendee and I be no exception TED literally be the launch pad to the next decade of my life exploration at the time the leg I present be groundbreaking in prosthetic I have weave carbon fiber sprinting leg model after the hind leg of a cheetah which you may have see on stage yesterday and also this very life like intrinsically paint silicone leg so at the time it be my opportunity to put a call out to innovator outside the traditional medical prosthetic community to come bring they talent to the science and to the art of build leg so that we can stop compartmentalize form function and aesthetic and assign they different value well lucky for I a lot of person answer that call and the journey start funny enough with a TED conference attendee Chee Pearlman who hopefully be in the audience somewhere today she be the editor then of a magazine call ID and she give I a cover story this start a incredible journey curious encounter be happen to I at the time I have be accept numerous invitation to speak on the design of the cheetah leg around the world and person would come up to I after the conference after my talk man and woman and the conversation would go something like this you know Aimee you be very attractive you do not look disabled laughter I think well that be amazing because I do not feel disabled and it really open my eye to this conversation that could be explore about beauty what do a beautiful woman have to look like what be a sexy body and interestingly from a identity standpoint what do it mean to have a disability I mean person Pamela Anderson have more prosthetic in she body than I do nobody call she disabled laughter so this magazine through the hand of graphic designer Peter Saville go to fashion designer Alexander McQueen and photographer Nick Knight who be also interested in explore that conversation so three month after TED I find myself on a plane to London do my first fashion shoot which result in this cover fashion able three month after that I do my first runway show for Alexander McQueen on a pair of hand carve wooden leg make from solid ash nobody know everyone think they be wooden boot actually I have they on stage with I grapevine magnolia truly stunning Poetry matter Poetry be what elevate the banal and neglect object to a realm of art it can transform the thing that might have make person fearful into something that invite they to look and look a little long and maybe even understand I learn this firsthand with my next adventure the artist Matthew Barney in he film opus call the the Cremaster cycle this be where it really hit home for I that my leg could be wearable sculpture and even at this point I start to move away from the need to replicate human ness as the only aesthetic ideal so we make what person lovingly refer to as glass leg even though they be actually optically clear polyurethane a k a bowling ball material heavy then we make this leg that be cast in soil with a potato root system grow in they and beetroot out the top and a very lovely brass toe that be a good close up of that one then another character be a half woman half cheetah a little homage to my life as a athlete 14 hour of prosthetic make up to get into a creature that have articulate paw claw and a tail that whip around like a gecko laughter and then another pair of leg we collaborate on be this look like jellyfish leg also polyurethane and the only purpose that this leg can serve outside the context of the film be to provoke the sens and ignite the imagination so whimsy matter today I have over a dozen pair of prosthetic leg that various person have make for I and with they I have different negotiation of the terrain under my foot and I can change my height I have a variable of five different height laughter today I be 6 1 and I have this leg make a little over a year ago at Dorset Orthopedic in England and when I bring they home to Manhattan my first night out on the town I go to a very fancy party and a girl be there who have know I for year at my normal 5 8 she mouth drop open when she see I and she go but you be so tall and I say I know be not it fun I mean it be a little bit like wear stilt on stilt but I have a entirely new relationship to door jam that I never expect I would ever have and I be have fun with it and she look at I and she say but Aimee that be not fair laughter applause and the incredible thing be she really mean it it be not fair that you can change you height as you want it and that be when I know that be when I know that the conversation with society have change profoundly in this last decade it be no long a conversation about overcome deficiency it be a conversation about augmentation it be a conversation about potential a prosthetic limb do not represent the need to replace loss anymore it can stand as a symbol that the wearer have the power to create whatever it be that they want to create in that space so person that society once consider to be disabled can now become the architect of they own identity and indeed continue to change that identity by design they body from a place of empowerment and what be exciting to I so much right now be that by combine cut edge technology robotic bionic with the age old poetry we be move close to understand we collective humanity I think that if we want to discover the full potential in we humanity we need to celebrate that heartbreaking strength and that glorious disability that we all have I think of Shakespeare Shylock if you prick we do we not bleed and if you tickle we do we not laugh it be we humanity and all the potential within it that make we beautiful thank you applause
