so here we go a flyby of play it be get to be serious if the New York Times put a cover story of they February 17th Sunday magazine about play at the bottom of this it say it be deep than gender seriously but dangerously fun and a sandbox for new idea about evolution not bad except if you look at that cover what be miss you see any adult well let go back to the 15th century this be a courtyard in Europe and a mixture of 124 different kind of play all age solo play body play game taunt and there it be and I think this be a typical picture of what it be like in a courtyard then I think we may have lose something in we culture so I be go to take you through what I think be a remarkable sequence North of Churchill Manitoba in October and November there be no ice on Hudson Bay and this polar bear that you see this 1200 pound male he be wild and fairly hungry and Norbert Rosing a German photographer be there on scene make a series of photo of this husky who be tether and from out of stage leave come this wild male polar bear with a predatory gaze any of you who have be to Africa or have a junkyard dog come after you there be a fix kind of predatory gaze that you know you be in trouble but on the other side of that predatory gaze be a female husky in a play bow wag she tail and something very unusual happen that fix behavior which be rigid and stereotyped and end up with a meal change and this polar bear stand over the husky no claw extend no fang take a look and they begin a incredible ballet a play ballet this be in nature it override a carnivorous nature and what otherwise would have be a short fight to the death and if you will begin to look closely at the husky that be bear she throat to the polar bear and look a little more closely they be in a altered state they be in a state of play and it be that state that allow this two creature to explore the possible they be begin to do something that neither would have do without the play signal and it be a marvelous example of how a differential in power can be override by a process of nature that be within all of we now how do I get involve in this John mention that I have do some work with murderer and I have the Texas Tower murderer open my eye in retrospect when we study he tragic mass murder to the importance of play in that that individual by deep study be find to have severe play deprivation Charles Whitman be he name and we committee which consist of a lot of hard scientist do feel at the end of that study that the absence of play and a progressive suppression of developmentally normal play lead he to be more vulnerable to the tragedy that he perpetrate and that finding have stand the test of time unfortunately even into more recent time at Virginia Tech and other study of population at risk sensitize I to the importance of play but I do not really understand what it be and it be many year in take play history of individual before I really begin to recognize that I do not really have a full understanding of it and I do not think any of we have a full understanding of it by any means but there be way of look at it that I think can give you give we all a taxonomy a way of think about it and this image be for human the beginning point of play when that mother and infant lock eye and the infant old enough to have a social smile what happen spontaneously be the eruption of joy on the part of the mother and she begin to babble and coo and smile and so do the baby if we have get they wire up with a electroencephalogram the right brain of each of they become attuned so that the joyful emergence of this early of play scene and the physiology of that be something we be begin to get a handle on and I would like you to think that every bit of more complex play build on this base for we human and so now I be go to take you through sort of a way of look at play but it be never just singularly one thing we be go to look at body play which be a spontaneous desire to get ourselves out of gravity this be a mountain goat if you be have a bad day try this jump up and down wiggle around you be go to feel well and you may feel like this character who be also just do it for its own sake it do not have a particular purpose and that be what be great about play if its purpose be more important than the act of do it it be probably not play and there be a whole other type of play which be object play and this Japanese macaque have make a snowball and he or she be go to roll down a hill and they do not throw it at each other but this be a fundamental part of be playful the human hand in manipulation of object be the hand in search of a brain the brain be in search of a hand and play be the medium by which that two be link in the good way JPL we hear this morning JPL be a incredible place they have locate two consultant Frank Wilson and Nate Johnson who be Frank Wilson be a neurologist Nate Johnson be a mechanic he teach mechanic in a high school in Long Beach and find that he student be no long able to solve problem and he try to figure out why and he come to the conclusion quite on he own that the student who could no longer solve problem such as fix car have not work with they hand Frank Wilson have write a book call the Hand they get together JPL hire they now JPL NASA and Boeing before they will hire a research and development problem solver even if they be summa cum laude from Harvard or Cal Tech if they have not fix car have not do stuff with they hand early in life play with they hand they can not problem solve as well so play be practical and it be very important now one of the thing about play be that it be bear by curiosity and exploration laughter but it have to be safe exploration this happen to be ok he be a anatomically interested little boy and that be he mom other situation would not be quite so good but curiosity exploration be part of the play scene if you want to belong you need social play and social play be part of what we be about here today and be a byproduct of the play scene Rough and tumble play this lioness see from a distance look like they be fight but if you look closely they be kind of like the polar bear and husky no claw flat fur soft eye open mouth with no fang balletic movement curvilinear movement all specific to play and rough and tumble play be a great learning medium for all of we Preschool kid for example should be allow to dive hit whistle scream be chaotic and develop through that a lot of emotional regulation and a lot of the other social byproduct cognitive emotional and physical that come as a part of rough and tumble play Spectator play ritual play we be involve in some of that that of you who be from Boston know that this be the moment rare where the Red Sox win the World Series but take a look at the face and the body language of everybody in this fuzzy picture and you can get a sense that they be all at play imaginative play I love this picture because my daughter who be now almost 40 be in this picture but it remind I of she storytelling and she imagination she ability to spin yarn at this age preschool a really important part of be a player be imaginative solo play and I love this one because it be also what we be about we all have a internal narrative that be we own inner story the unit of intelligibility of most of we brain be the story I be tell you a story today about play well this bushman I think be talk about the fish that get away that be that long but it be a fundamental part of the play scene so what do play do for the brain well a lot we do not know a whole lot about what it do for the human brain because funding have not be exactly heavy for research on play I walk into the Carnegie ask for a grant they have give I a large grant when I be a academician for the study of felony drunken driver and I think I have a pretty good track record and by the time I have spend half a hour talk about play it be obvious that they be not do not feel that play be serious I think that that be a few year back I think that wave be past and the play wave be crest because there be some good science nothing light up the brain like play three dimensional play fire up the cerebellum put a lot of impulse into the frontal lobe the executive portion help contextual memory be develop and and and and so it be for I its be a extremely nourishing scholarly adventure to look at the neuroscience that be associate with play and to bring together person who in they individual discipline have not really think of it that way and that be part of what the National Institute for Play be all about and this be one of the way you can study play be to get a 256 lead electroencephalogram I be sorry I do not have a playful look subject but it allow mobility which have limit the actual study of play and we have get a mother infant play scenario that we be hope to complete underway at the moment the reason I put this here be also to queue up my thought about objectify what play do the animal world have objectify it in the animal world if you take rat who be hardwire to play at a certain period of they juvenile year and you suppress play they squeak they wrestle they pin each other that be part of they play if you stop that behavior on one group that you be experiment with and you allow it in another group that you be experiment with and then you present that rat with a cat odor saturate collar they be hardwire to flee and hide pretty smart they do not want to get kill by a cat so what happen they both hide out the non player never come out they die the player slowly explore the environment and begin again to test thing out that say to I at least in rat and I think they have the same neurotransmitter that we do and a similar cortical architecture that play may be pretty important for we survival and and and there be a lot more animal study that I could talk about now this be a consequence of play deprivation laughter this take a long time I have to get Homer down and put he through the fmri and the SPECT and multiple eeg but as a couch potato he brain have shrink and we do know that in domestic animal and other when they be play deprive they do not and rat also they do not develop a brain that be normal now the program say that the opposite of play be not work it be depression and I think if you think about life without play no humor no flirtation no movie no game no fantasy and and and try and imagine a culture or a life adult or otherwise without play and the thing that be so unique about we species be that we be really design to play through we whole lifetime and we all have capacity to play signal nobody miss that dog I take a picture of on a Carmel beach a couple of week ago what be go to follow from that behavior be play and you can trust it the basis of human trust be establish through play signal and we begin to lose that signal culturally and otherwise as adult that be a shame I think we have get a lot of learning to do now Jane Goodall have here a play face along with one of she favorite chimp so part of the signaling system of play have to do with vocal facial body gestural you know you can tell and I think when we be get into collective play its really important for group to gain a sense of safety through they own sharing of play signal you may not know this word but it should be you biological first name and last name because neoteny mean the retention of immature quality into adulthood and we be by physical anthropologist by many many study the most neotenous the most youthful the most flexible the most plastic of all creature and therefore the most playful and this give we a leg up on adaptability now there be a way of look at play that I also want to emphasize here which be the play history you own personal play history be unique and often be not something we think about particularly this be a book write by a consummate player by the name of Kevin Carroll Kevin Carroll come from extremely deprive circumstance alcoholic mother absent father inner city Philadelphia black have to take care of a young brother find that when he look at a playground out of a window into which he have be confine he feel something different and so he follow up on it and he life the transformation of he life from deprivation and what one would expect potentially prison or death he become a linguist a trainer for the 76er and now be a motivational speaker and he give play as a transformative force over he entire life now there be another play history that I think be a work in progress that of you who remember Al Gore during the first term and then during he successful but unelected run for the presidency may remember he as be kind of wooden and not entirely he own person at least in public and look at he history which be common in the press it seem to I at least look at it from a shrink point of view that a lot of he life be program summer be hard hard work in the heat of Tennessee summer he have the expectation of he senatorial father and Washington D C and although I think he certainly have the capacity for play because I do know something about that he be not as empower I think as he now be by pay attention to what be he own passion and he own inner drive which I think have its basis in all of we in we play history so what I would encourage on a individual level to do be to explore backwards as far as you can go to the most clear joyful playful image that you have whether it be with a toy on a birthday or on a vacation and begin to build to build from the emotion of that into how that connect with you life now and you will find you may change job which have happen to a number person when I have have they do this in order to be more empower through they play or you will be able to enrich you life by prioritize it and pay attention to it most of we work with group and I put this up because the d school the design school at Stanford thanks to David Kelley and a lot of other who have be visionary about its establishment have allow a group of we to get together and create a course call from play to Innovation and you will see this course be to investigate the human state of play which be kind of like the polar bear husky state and its importance to creative thinking to explore play behavior its development and its biological basis to apply that principle through design thinking to promote innovation in the corporate world and the student will work with real world partner on design project with widespread application this be we maiden voyage in this we be about two and a half three month into it and it be really be fun there be we star pupil this labrador who teach a lot of we what a state of play be and a extremely aged and decrepit professor in charge there and Brendan Boyle Rich Crandall and on the far right be I think a person who will be in cahoots with George Smoot for a Nobel Prize Stuart Thompson in neuroscience so we have have Brendan who be from IDEO and the rest of we sit aside and watch this student as they put play principle into practice in the classroom and one of they project be to see what make meeting boring and to try and do something about it so what will follow be a student make film about just that Narrator Flow be the mental state of apparition in which the person be fully immerse in what he or she be do characterize by a feeling of energized focus full involvement and success in the process of the activity a important key insight that we learn about meeting be that person pack they in one after another disruptive to the day attendee at meeting do not know when they will get back to the task that they leave at they desk but it do not have to be that way music some sage and repeatedly furry monk at this place call the d school design a meeting that you can literally step out of when it be over take the meeting off and have peace of mind that you can come back to I because when you need it again the meeting be literally hang in you closet the Wearable Meeting because when you put it on you immediately get everything you need to have a fun and productive and useful meeting but when you take it off that be when the real action happen music laughter applause Stuart Brown so I would encourage you all to engage not in the work play differential where you set aside time to play but where you life become infuse minute by minute hour by hour with body object social fantasy transformational kind of play and I think you will have a good and more empower life thank you applause John Hockenberry so it sound to I like what you be say be that there may be some temptation on the part of person to look at you work and go I think I have hear this in my kind of pop psychological understanding of play that somehow the way animal and human deal with play be that it be some sort of rehearsal for adult activity you work seem to suggest that that be powerfully wrong sb yeah I do not think that be accurate and I think probably because animal have teach we that if you stop a cat from play which you can do and we have all see how cat bat around stuff they be just as good predator as they would be if they have not play and if you imagine a kid pretend to be King Kong or a race car driver or a fireman they do not all become race car driver or fireman you know so there be a disconnect between preparation for the future which be what most person be comfortable in think about play as and thinking of it as a separate biological entity and this be where my chasing animal for four five year really change my perspective from a clinician to what I be now which be that play have a biological place just like sleep and dream do and if you look at sleep and dream biologically animal sleep and dream and they rehearse and they do some other thing that help memory and that be a very important part of sleep and dream the next step of evolution in mammal and creature with divinely superfluous neuron will be to play and the fact that the polar bear and husky or magpie and a bear or you and I and we dog can crossover and have that experience set play aside as something separate and its hugely important in learning and craft the brain so it be not just something you do in you spare time JH how do you keep and I know you be part of the scientific research community and you have to justify you existence with grant and proposal like everyone else how do you prevent and some of the datum that you have produce the good science that you be talk about you have produce be hot to handle how do you prevent either the media interpretation of you work or the scientific community interpretation of the implication of you work kind of like the Mozart metaphor where oh mri show that play enhance you intelligence well let round this kid up put they in pen and make they play for month at a time they will all be genius and go to Harvard how do you prevent person from take that sort of action on the datum that you be develop SB well I think the only way I know to do it be to have accumulate the adviser that I have who go from practitioner who can establish through improvisational play or clown or whatever a state of play so person know that it be there and then you get a fmri specialist and you get Frank Wilson and you get other kind of hard scientist include neuroendocrinologist and you get they into a group together focus on play and it be pretty hard not to take it seriously unfortunately that have not be do sufficiently for the National Science Foundation National Institute of Mental Health or anybody else to really look at it in this way seriously I mean you do not hear about anything that be like cancer or heart disease associate with play and yet I see it as something that be just as basic for survival long term as learn some of the basic thing about public health JH Stuart Brown thank you very much applause
