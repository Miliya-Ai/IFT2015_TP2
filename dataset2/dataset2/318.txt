a human child be bear and for quite a long time be a consumer it can not be consciously a contributor it be helpless it do not know how to survive even though it be endow with a instinct to survive it need the help of mother or a foster mother to survive it can not afford to doubt the person who tend the child it have to totally surrender as one surrender to a anesthesiologist it have to totally surrender that imply a lot of trust that imply the trusted person will not violate the trust as the child grow it begin to discover that the person trust be violate the trust it do not know even the word violation therefore it have to blame itself a wordless blame which be more difficult to really resolve the wordless self blame as the child grow to become a adult so far it have be a consumer but the growth of a human being lie in he or she capacity to contribute to be a contributor one can not contribute unless one feel secure one feel big one feel I have enough to be compassionate be not a joke it be not that simple one have to discover a certain bigness in oneself that bigness should be center on oneself not in term of money not in term of power you wield not in term of any status that you can command in the society but it should be center on oneself the self you be self aware on that self it should be center a bigness a wholeness otherwise compassion be just a word and a dream you can be compassionate occasionally more move by empathy than by compassion thank God we be empathetic when somebody be in pain we pick up the pain in a Wimbledon final match this two guy fight it out each one have get two game it can be anybody game what they have sweat so far have no meaning one person win the tennis etiquette be both the player have to come to the net and shake hand the winner box the air and kiss the ground throw he shirt as though somebody be wait for it laughter and this guy have to come to the net when he come to the net you see he whole face change it look as though he be wish that he do not win why Empathy that be human heart no human heart be deny of that empathy no religion can demolish that by indoctrination no culture no nation and nationalism nothing can touch it because it be empathy and that capacity to empathize be the window through which you reach out to person you do something that make a difference in somebody life even word even time Compassion be not define in one form there be no Indian compassion there be no American compassion it transcend nation the gender the age why because it be there in everybody it be experience by person occasionally then this occasional compassion we be not talk about it will never remain occasional by mandate you can not make a person compassionate you can not say please love I love be something you discover it be not a action but in the English language it be also a action I will come to it later so one have get to discover a certain wholeness I be go to cite the possibility of be whole which be within we experience everybody experience in spite of a very tragic life one be happy in moment which be very few and far between and the one who be happy even for a slapstick joke accept himself and also the scheme of thing in which one find oneself that mean the whole universe know thing and unknown thing all of they be totally accept because you discover you wholeness in yourself the subject I and the object the scheme of thing fuse into oneness a experience nobody can say I be deny of a experience common to all and sundry that experience confirm that in spite of all you limitation all you want desire unfulfilled and the credit card and layoff and finally baldness you can be happy but the extension of the logic be that you do not need to fulfill you desire to be happy you be the very happiness the wholeness that you want to be there be no choice in this that only confirm the reality that the wholeness can not be different from you can not be minus you it have get to be you you can not be a part of wholeness and still be whole you moment of happiness reveal that reality that realization that recognition maybe I be the whole maybe the swami be right maybe the swami be right you start you new life then everything become meaningful I have no more reason to blame myself if one have to blame oneself one have a million reason plus many but if I say in spite of my body be limit if it be black it be not white if it be white it be not black body be limit any which way you look at it limit you knowledge be limited health be limited and power be therefore limit and the cheerfulness be go to be limit Compassion be go to be limit everything be go to be limitless you can not command compassion unless you become limitless and nobody can become limitless either you be or you be not period and there be no way of you be not limitless too you own experience reveal in spite of all limitation you be the whole and the wholeness be the reality of you when you relate to the world it be love first when you relate to the world the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness be what we say love and itself become compassion if the object that you relate to evoke that emotion then that again transform into give into share you express yourself because you have compassion to discover compassion you need to be compassionate to discover the capacity to give and share you need to be give and share there be no shortcut it be like swimming by swim you learn swimming by swim you can not learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water laughter you learn swimming by swim you learn cycling by cycle you learn cook by cook have some sympathetic person around you to eat what you cook laughter and therefore what I say you have to fake it and make it laughter you need to my predecessor mean that you have to act it out you have to act compassionately there be no verb for compassion but you have a adverb for compassion that be interesting to I you act compassionately but then how to act compassionately if you do not have compassion that be where you fake you fake it and make it this be the mantra of the United States of America laughter you fake it and make it you act compassionately as though you have compassion grind you tooth take all the support system if you know how to pray pray ask for compassion let I act compassionately do it you will discover compassion and also slowly a relative compassion and slowly perhaps if you get the right teaching you will discover compassion be a dynamic manifestation of the reality of yourself which be oneness wholeness and that be what you be with this word thank you very much applause
