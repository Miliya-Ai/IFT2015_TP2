over the past couple of day as I have be prepare for my speech I have become more and more nervous about what I be go to say and about be on the same stage as all this fascinating person be on the same stage as Al Gore who be the first person I ever vote for and laughter so I be get pretty nervous and you know I do not know that Chris sit on the stage and that be more nerve rack but then I start think about my family I start think about my father and my grandfather and my great grandfather and I realize that I have all of this ted go through my bloodstream laughter that I have to

this freakish thing this be my science slide this be math and this be science this be genetics this be my grandmother and this be where I get this mouth laughter so I be a blogger which probably to a lot of you mean different thing you may have hear about the Kryptonite lock brouhaha where a blogger talk about how you hack or break into a Kryptonite lock use a ballpoint pen and it spread all over Kryptonite have to adjust the lock and they have to address it to avoid too many customer concern you may have hear about Rathergate which be basically the result of blogger realize that the th in 111 be not typeset on a old typewriter it be on Word Bloggers expose this or they work hard to expose this you know blog be scary this be what you see I see this and I be sure scared I swear on stage shitless about blog because this be not something that be friendly but there be blog that be change the way we read news and consume media and this be great example this person be reach thousand if not million of reader and that be incredibly important during the hurricane you have MSNBC post about the hurricane on they blog update it frequently this be possible because of the easy nature of blogg tool you have my friend who have a blog on pvr personal recorder he make enough money just by run ad to support he family up in Oregon that be all he do now and this be something that blog have make possible and then you have something like this which be interplast it be a wonderful organization of person and doctor who go to develop nation to offer plastic surgery to that who need it child with cleft palate get it and they document they story this be wonderful I be not that caring laughter I talk about myself that be what I be I be a blogger I have always decide that I be go to be a expert on one thing and I be a expert on this person and so I write about it so the short story about my blog it start in 2001 I be 23 I be not happy with my job because I be a designer but I be not be really stimulate I be a English major in college I do not have any use for it but I miss write so I start to write a blog and I start to create thing like this little story this be a illustration about my camp experience when I be 11 year old and how I go to a ymca camp Christian camp and basically by the end I have make my friend hate I so much that I hide in a bunk they could not find I they send a search party and I overhear person say they wish I have kill myself jump off Bible Peak you can laugh this be ok laughter this be I this be what happen to I and when I start my blog it be really this one goal I say I be not go to be famous to the world but I could be famous to person on the internet and I set a goal I say I be go to win a award because I have never win a award in my entire life and I say I be go to win the South by Southwest Weblog award and I win it I reach all of this person and I have ten of thousand of person read about my life every day and then I write a post about a banjo I write a post about want to buy a banjo a 300 banjo which be a lot of money and I do not play instrument I do not know anything about music I like music and I like banjo and I think I probably hear Steve Martin play and I say I could do that and I say to my husband Ben can I buy a banjo and he be like no and my husband laughter this be my husband who be very hot he win a award for be hot laughter he tell I you can not buy a banjo you be just like you dad who collect instrument and I write a post about how I be so mad at he he be such a tyrant he would not let I buy this banjo and that person who know I understand my joke this be Mena this be how I make a joke at person because the joke in this be that this person be not a tyrant this person be so loving and so sweet that he let I dress he up and post picture of he to my blog laughter and if he know I be show this right now I put this in today he would kill I but the thing be my friend read it and they be like oh that Mena she write a post about want a stupid thing and be stupid but I get email from person that say oh my God you husband be such a asshole how much money do he spend on beer in a year you could take that money and buy you banjo why do not you open a separate account I have be with he since I be 17 we have never have a separate bank account they say separate you bank account spend you money spend he money that be it and then I get person say leave he laughter I be like ok what who be this person and why be they read this and I realize I do not want to reach this person I do not want to write for this public audience and I start to kill my blog slowly I be like I do not want to write this anymore slowly and slowly and I do tell personal story from time to time I write this one and I put this up because of Einstein today I be go to get choke up because this be my first pet and she pass away two year ago and I decide to break from I do not really write about my public life because I want to give she a little memorial but anyways it be this sort of personal story you know you read the blog about politics or about media and gossip and all this thing this be out there but it be more of the personal that interest I and this be who I be you see Norman Rockwell and you have art critic say Norman Rockwell be not art Norman Rockwell hang in live room and bathroom and this be not something to be consider high art and I think this be one of the most important thing to we as human this thing resonate with we and if you think about blog you think of high art blog the history painting about you know all the biblical story and then you have this this be the blog that interest I the person that just tell story one story be about this baby and he name be Odin he father be a blogger and he be write he blog one day and he wife give birth to she baby at 25 week and he never expect this one day it be normal the next day it be hell and this be a one pound baby so Odin be document every single day picture be take every day day one day two you have day nine they be talk about he apnea day 39 he get pneumonia he baby be so small and I have never encounter such a just a disturbing image but just so heartfelt and you be read this as it happen so on day 55 everybody read that he be have failure breathe failure and heart failure and it be slow down and you do not know what to expect but then it get good day 96 he go home and you see this post that be not something you be go to see in a paper or magazine but this be something this person feel and person be excited about it 28 comment that be not a huge amount of person read but 28 person matter and today he be a healthy baby who if you read he blog it be snowdeal org he father blog he be take picture of he still because he be still he son and he be I think at he age level right now because he have receive such great treatment from the hospital so blog so what you have probably hear this thing before we talk about the well and about all this sort of thing throughout we online history but I think blog be basically just a evolution and that be where we be today it be this record of who you be you persona you have you Google search where you say what be Mena Trott and then you find this thing and you be happy or unhappy but then you also find person blog and that be the record of person that be write daily not necessarily about the same topic but thing that interest they and we talk about the world flatten be in this panel and I be very optimistic whenever I think about blog I be like we have get to reach all this person hundred of million and billion of person we be get into China we want to be there but there be so many person that will not have the access to write a blog but to see something like the 100 computer be amazing because blogg software be simple we have a successful company because of timing and because of perseverance but it be simple stuff it be not rocket science and so that be a amazing thing to consider so the life record of a blog be something that I find incredibly important and we start with a slide of my ted and I have to add this slide because I know the minute I show this my mom my mom will see this because she do read my blog and she will say why be not there a picture of I this be my mom so I have all the person that I know of but this be basically the extent of the family that I know in term of my direct line I show a Norman Rockwell painting before and this one I grow up with look at constantly I would spend hour look at the connection say oh the little kid up at the top have red hair so do that first generation up there and it be just this little thing this be not science but this be enough for I to be really interested in how we have evolve and how we can trace we line so that have always influence I I have this record this 1910 census of another Grabowski that be my maiden name and there be a Theodore because there be always a Theodore this be all I have a couple of fact about somebody I have they date of birth they age what they do in they household if they speak English and that be it that be all I know of this person and it be pretty sad because I only go back five generation and that be it I do not even know what happen on my mom side because she be from Cuba and I do not have that many thing just do this I spend time in the archive that be why my husband a saint I spend time in the Washington archive just sit there look for this thing now it be online but he sit through that and so you have this record and this be my great great grandmother this be the only picture I have and to think of what we have the ability to do with we blog to think about the person that be on that 100 computer talk about who they be share this personal story this be a amazing thing another photo that have greatly influence I or a series of photo be this project that be do by a argentinean man and he wife and he be basically take a picture of he family every day for the past what be 76 20 oh my God I be 77 29 year twenty nine year there be a joke originally about my graph that I leave out which be you see all this math I be just happy I be able to add it up to 100 because that be my skill set laughter so you have this person age and now this be they today or last year and that be a powerful thing to have to be able to track this I wish that I would have this of my family I know that one day my child will be wonder or my grandchild or my great grandchild if I ever have child what I be go to who I be so I do something that be very narcissistic I be a blogger that be a amazing thing for I because it capture a moment in time every day I take a picture of myself I have be do this since last year every single day and you know it be the same picture it be basically the same person only a couple of person read it I do not write this for this audience I be show it now but I would go insane if this be really public about four person probably read it and they tell I you have not update I be probably go to get person tell I I have not update but this be amazing because I can go back to a day to April 2005 and say what be I do this day I look at it I know exactly it be this visual cue that be so important to what we do I put the bad picture up too because there be bad picture laughter and I remember instantly I be in Germany in this I have to go for a one day trip I be sick and I be in a hotel room and I want not to be there and so you see this thing it be not just always smile now I have kind of evolve it so I have this look if you look at my driver license I have the same look and it be a pretty disturbing thing but it be something that be really important and the last story I really want to tell be this story because this be probably the one that mean the most to I in all of what I be do I will probably get choke up because I tend to when I talk about this so this woman she name be Emma and she be a blogger on we service TypePad and she be a beta tester so she be there right when we open you know there be 100 person and she write about she life deal with cancer she be write and write and we all start read it because we have so few blog on the service we could keep track of everyone and she be write one day and then she disappear for a little bit and she sister come on and she say that Emma have pass away and all of we support staff who have talk to she be really emotional and it be a very hard day at the company and this be one of that instance where I realize how much blogging affect we relationship and flatten this sort of world that this woman be in England and she live she live a life where she be talk about what she be do but the big thing that really influence we be she sister write to I and she say and she write on this blog that write she blog during the last couple of month of she life be probably the good thing that have happen to she and be able to talk to person and to share what be go on and be able to write and receive comment and that be amazing to be able to know that we have empower that and that blogging be something that she feel comfortable do and the idea that blogging do not have to be scary that we do not always have to be attack of the blog that we can be person who be open and want to help and talk to person that be a amazing thing and so I print out and send a pdf of she blog to she family and they pass it out at she memorial service and even in she obituary they mention she blog because it be such a big part of she life and that be a huge thing so this be she legacy and I think that my call to action to all of you be think about blog think about what they be think about what you have think of they and then actually do it because it be something that be really go to change we life so thank you applause
