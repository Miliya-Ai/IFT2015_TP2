it be wonderful to be back I love this wonderful gathering and you must be wonder what on earth have they put up the wrong slide no no look at this magnificent beast and ask the question who design it this be TED this be Technology Entertainment Design and there be a dairy cow it be a quite wonderfully design animal and I be think how do I introduce this and I think well maybe that old doggerel by Joyce Kilmer you know poem be make by fool like I but only God can make a tree and you might say well God design the cow but of course God get a lot of help this be the ancestor of cattle this be the auroch and it be design by natural selection the process of natural selection over many million of year and then it become domesticated thousand of year ago and human being become its steward and without even know what they be do they gradually redesign it and redesign it and redesign it and then more recently they really begin to do reverse engineering on this beast and figure out just what the part be how they work and how they might be optimize how they might be make good now why be I talk about cow because I want to say that much the same thing be true of religion religion be natural phenomenon they be just as natural as cow they have evolve over millennia they have a biological base just like the auroch they have become domesticated and human being have be redesign they religion for thousand of year this be TED and I want to talk about design because what I have be do for the last four year really since the first time you see I some of you see I at TED when I be talk about religion and in the last four year I have be work just about non stop on this topic and you might say it be about the reverse engineering of religion now that very idea I think strike terror in many person or anger or anxiety of one sort or another and that be the spell that I want to break I want to say no religion be a important natural phenomenon we should study they with the same intensity that we study all the other important natural phenomenon like global warming as we hear so eloquently last night from Al Gore today religion be brilliantly design brilliantly design they be immensely powerful social institution and many of they feature can be trace back to early feature that we can really make sense of by reverse engineering and as with the cow there be a mixture of evolutionary design design by natural selection itself and intelligent design more or less intelligent design and redesign by human being who be try to redesign they religion you do not do book talk at TED but I be go to have just one slide about my book because there be one message in it which I think this group really need to hear and I would be very interested to get you response to this it be the one policy proposal that I make in the book at this time when I claim not to know enough about religion to know what other policy proposal to make and it be one that echo remark that you have hear already today here be my proposal I be go to just take a couple of minute to explain it education on world religion for all of we child in primary school in high school in public school in private school and in home schooling so what I be propose be just as we require read write arithmetic American history so we should have a curriculum on fact about all the religion of the world about they history about they creed about they text they music they symbolism they prohibition they requirement and this should be present factually straightforwardly with no particular spin to all of the child in the country and as long as you teach they that you can teach they anything else you like that I think be maximal tolerance for religious freedom as long as you inform you child about other religion then you may and as early as you like and whatever you like teach they whatever creed you want they to learn but also let they know about other religion now why do I say that because democracy depend on a informed citizenship inform consent be the very bedrock of we understand of democracy misinform consent be not worth it it be like a coin flip it do not count really democracy depend on informed consent this be the way we treat person as responsible adult now child below the age of consent be a special case parent I be go to use a word that Pastor Rick just use parent be steward of they child they do not own they you can not own you child you have a responsibility to the world to the state to they to take care of they right you may teach they whatever creed you think be most important but I say you have a responsibility to let they be inform about all the other creed in the world too the reason I have take this time be I have be fascinate to hear some of the reaction to this one reviewer for a Roman Catholic newspaper call it totalitarian it strike I as practically Libertarian be it totalitarian to require reading writing and arithmetic I do not think so all I be say be and fact fact only no value just fact about all the world religion another reviewer call it hilarious well I be really bother by the fact that anybody would think that be hilarious it seem to I to be such a plausible natural extension of the democratic principle we already have that I be shock to think anybody would find that just ridiculous I know many religion be so anxious about preserve the purity of they faith among they child that they be intent on keep they child ignorant of other faith I do not think that be defensible but I would really be pleased to get you answer on that any reaction to that later but now I be go to move on back to the cow this picture which I pull off the web the fellow on the left be really a important part of this picture that be the steward cow could not live without human steward they be domesticate they be a sort of ectosymbiont they depend on we for they survival and pastor Rick be just talk about sheep I be go to talk about sheep too there be a lot of serendipitous convergence here how clever it be of sheep to acquire shepherd laughter think of what this get they they could outsource all they problem protection from predator food find laughter health maintenance laughter the only cost in most flock not even this a loss of free mating what a deal how clever of sheep you might say except of course it be not the sheep cleverness we all know sheep be not exactly rocket scientist they be not very smart it be not the cleverness of the sheep at all they be clueless but it be a very clever move whose clever move be it it be the clever move of natural selection itself Francis Crick the co discoverer of the structure of dna with Jim Watson once joke about what he call Orgel second rule Leslie Orgel be a molecular biologist brilliant guy and Orgel second rule be evolution be clever than you be now that be not Intelligent Design not from Francis Crick evolution be clever than you be if you understand Orgel second rule then you understand why the Intelligent Design movement be basically a hoax the design discover by the process of natural selection be brilliant unbelievably brilliant again and again biologist be fascinate with the brilliance of what be discover but the process itself be without purpose without foresight without design when I be here four year ago I tell the story about a ant climb a blade of grass and why the ant be do it be because its brain have be infect with a lancet fluke that be need to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to reproduce so it be sort of a spooky story and I think some person may have misunderstand Lancet fluke be not smart I submit that the intelligence of a lancet fluke be down there somewhere between petunia and carrot they be not really bright they do not have to be the lesson we learn from this be you do not have to have a mind to be a beneficiary the design be there in nature but it be not in anybody head it do not have to be that be the way evolution work question be domestication good for sheep it be great for they genetic fitness and here I want to remind you of a wonderful point that Paul MacCready make at TED three year ago here be what he say ten thousand year ago at the dawn of agriculture human population plus livestock and pet be approximately a tenth of one percent of the terrestrial vertebrate landmass that be just 10 000 year ago yesterday in biological term what be it today do anybody remember what he tell we 98 percent that be what we have do on this planet now I talk to Paul afterwards I want to check to find out how he have calculate this and get the source and so forth and he also give I a paper that he have write on this and there be a passage in it which he do not present here and I think it be so good I be go to read it to you over billion of year on a unique sphere chance have paint a thin covering of life complex improbable wonderful and fragile suddenly we human a recently arrive species no long subject to the check and balance inherent in nature have grow in population technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power we now wield the paintbrush we hear about the atmosphere as a thin layer of varnish life itself be just a thin coat of paint on this planet and we be the one that hold the paintbrush and how can we do that the key to we domination of the planet be culture and the key to culture be religion suppose Martian scientist come to Earth they would be puzzle by many thing anybody know what this be I will tell you what it be this be a million person gather on the bank of the gange in 2001 perhaps the large single gathering of human being ever as see from satellite photograph here be a big crowd here be another crowd in Mecca Martian would be amazed by this they have want to know how it originate what it be for and how it perpetuate itself actually I be go to pass over this the ant be not alone there be all sort of wonderful case of species which in that case a parasite get into a mouse and need to get into the belly of a cat and it turn the mouse into mighty mouse make it fearless so it run out in the open where it will be eat by a cat true story in other word we have this hijacker you have see this slide before from four year ago a parasite that infect the brain and induce even suicidal behavior on behalf of a cause other than one own genetic fitness do that ever happen to we yes it do quite wonderfully the Arabic word Islam mean submission it mean surrender of self interest to the will of Allah but I be not just talk about Islam I be talk also about Christianity this be a parchment music page that I find in a Paris bookstall 50 year ago and on it it say in Latin Semen est verbum dei sator autem Christus the word of God be the seed and the sower of the seed be Christ same idea well not quite but in fact Christian too glory in the fact that they have surrender to God I will give you a few quote the heart of worship be surrender surrender person obey God word even if it do not make sense that word be by Rick Warren that be from the purpose Driven Life and I want to turn now briefly to talk about that book which I have read you have all get a copy and you have just hear the man and what I want to do now be say a bit about this book from the design standpoint because I think it be actually a brilliant book First of all the goal and you hear just now what the goal be it be to bring purpose to the life of million and he have succeed be it a good goal in itself I be sure we all agree it be a wonderful goal he be absolutely right there be lot of person out there who do not have purpose in they life and bring purpose to they life be a wonderful goal I give he a a on this laughter be the goal achieve yes thirty million copy of this book Al Gore eat you heart out laughter just exactly what Al be try to do Rick be do this be a fantastic achievement and the means how do he do it it be a brilliant redesign of traditional religious theme update they quietly drop obsolete feature put new interpretation on other feature this be the evolution of religion that be be go on for thousand of year and he be just the late brilliant practitioner of it I do not have to tell you this you just hear the man excellent insight into human psychology wise advice on every page moreover he invite we to look under the hood I really appreciate that for instance he have a appendix where he explain he choice of translation of different Bible verses the book be clear vivid accessible beautifully format just enough repetition that be really important every time you read it or say it you make another copy in you brain every time you read it or say it you make another copy in you brain laughter with I everybody audience and Dan Dennett every time you read it or say it you make another copy in you brain thank you and now we come to my problem because I be absolutely sincere in my appreciation of all that I say about this book but I wish it be good I have some problem with the book and it would just be insincere of I not to address that problem I wish he could do this with a revision a Mark 2 version of he book the truth will set you free that be what it say in the Bible and it be something that I want to live by too my problem be some of the bit in it I do not think be true now some of this be a difference of opinion and that be not my main complaint that be worth mention here be a passage it be very much what he say anyway if there be no God we would all be accident the result of astronomical random chance in the Universe you could stop read this book because life would have no purpose or meaning or significance there would be no right or wrong and no hope beyond you brief year on Earth now I just do not believe that by the way I find Homer Groening film present a beautiful alternative to that very claim yes there be mean and a reason for right or wrong we do not need a belief in God to be good or to have meaning in we but that as I say be just a difference of opinion that be not what I be really worried about how about this God design this planet environment just so we could live in it I be afraid that a lot of person take that sentiment to mean that we do not have to do the sort of thing that Al Gore be try so hard to get we to do I be not happy with that sentiment at all and then I find this all the evidence available in the biological science support the core proposition that the cosmos be a specially design whole with life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose a whole in which all facet of reality have they mean and explanation in this central fact well that be Michael Denton he be a creationist and here I think wait a minute I read this again I read it three or four time and I think be he really endorse Intelligent Design be he endorse creationism here and you can not tell so I be sort of think well I do not know I do not know if I want to get upset with this yet but then I read on and I read this first Noah have never see rain because prior to the Flood God irrigate the earth from the ground up I wish that sentence be not in there because I think it be false and I think that think this way about the history of the planet after we have just be hear about the history of the planet over million of year discourage person from scientific understanding now Rick Warren use scientific term and scientific factoid and information in a very interesting way here be one God deliberately shape and form you to serve he in a way that make you ministry unique he carefully mix the dna cocktail that create you I think that be false now maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical here be another one for instance you brain can store 100 trillion fact you mind can handle 15 000 decision a second well it would be interesting to find the interpretation where I would accept that there might be some way of treat that as true anthropologist have note that worship be a universal urge hardwire by God into the very fiber of we be a inbuilt need to connect with God well the sense of which I agree with he except I think it have a evolutionary explanation and what I find deeply troubling in this book be that he seem to be argue that if you want to be moral if you want to have meaning in you life you have to be a Intelligent designer you have to deny the theory of evolution by natural selection and I think on the contrary that it be very important to solve the world problem that we take evolutionary biology seriously whose truth be we go to listen to well this be from the purpose Driven Life the Bible must become the authoritative standard for my life the compass I rely on for direction the counsel I listen to for make wise decision and the benchmark I use for evaluate everything well maybe ok but what be go to follow from this and here be one that do concern I remember I quote he before with this line surrender person obey God word even if it do not make sense and that be a problem sigh do not ever argue with the Devil he be good at argue than you be have have thousand of year to practice now Rick Warren do not invent this clever move it be a old move it be a very clever adaptation of religion it be a wild card for disarm any reasonable criticism you do not like my interpretation you have get a reasonable objection to it do not listen do not listen that be the Devil speak this discourage the sort of reasoning citizenship it seem to I that we want to have I have get one more problem then I be through and I would really like to get a response if Rick be able to do it in the Great Commission Jesus say go to all person of all nation and make they my disciple baptize they in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit and teach they to do everything I have tell you the Bible say Jesus be the only one who can save the world we have see many wonderful map of the world in the last day or so here be one not as beautiful as the other it simply show the religion of the world here be one that show the sort of current breakdown of the different religion do we really want to commit ourselves to engulf all the other religion when they holy book be tell they do not listen to the other side that be just Satan talk it seem to I that that be a very problematic ship to get on for the future I find this sign as I be drive to Maine recently in front of a church good without God become zero sort of cute a very clever little meme I do not believe it and I think this idea popular as it be not in this guise but in general be itself one of the main problem that we face if you be like I you know many wonderful committed engaged atheist agnostic who be be very good without God and you also know many religious person who hide behind they sanctity instead of do good work so I wish we could drop this meme I wish this meme would go extinct thanks very much for you attention applause
