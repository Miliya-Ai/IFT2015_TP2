one of my favorite cartoon character be Snoopy I love the way he sit and lie on he kennel and contemplate the great thing of life so when I think about compassion my mind immediately go to one of the cartoon strip where he be lie there and he say I really understand and I really appreciate how one should love one neighbor as one love oneself the only trouble be the person next door I can not stand they this in a way be one of the challenge of how to interpret a really good idea we all I think believe in compassion if you look at all the world religion all the main world religion you will find within they some teaching concern compassion so in Judaism we have from we Torah that you should love you neighbor as you love yourself and within Jewish teaching the rabbinic teaching we have Hillel who teach that you should not do to other what you do not like be do to yourself and all the main religion have similar teaching and again within Judaism we have a teaching about God who be call the compassionate one ha rachaman after all how could the world exist without God be compassionate and we as teach within the Torah that we be make in the image of God so we too have to be compassionate but what do it mean how do it impact on we everyday life sometimes of course be compassionate can produce feeling within we that be very difficult to control I know there be many time when I have go and conduct a funeral or when I have be sit with the bereave or with person who be die and I be overwhelm by the sadness by the difficulty the challenge that be there for the family for the person and I be touch so that tear come to my eye and yet if I just allow myself to be overwhelm by this feeling I would not be do my job because I have to actually be there for they and make sure that ritual happen that practicality be see to and yet on the other hand if I do not feel this compassion then I feel that it would be time for I to hang up my robe and give up be a rabbi and this same feeling be there for all of we as we face the world who can not be touch by compassion when we see the terrible horror of the result of war or famine or earthquake or tsunami I know some person who say well you know there be just so much out there I can not do anything I be not go to even begin to try and there be some charity worker who call this compassion fatigue there be other who feel they can not confront compassion anymore and so they turn off the television and do not watch in Judaism though we tend to always say there have to be a middle way you have to of course be aware of the need of other but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with you life and be of help to person so part of compassion have to be a understanding of what make person tick and of course you can not do that unless you understand yourself a bit more and there be a lovely rabbinic interpretation of the beginning of creation which say that when God create the world God think that it would be good to create the world only with the divine attribute of justice because after all God be just therefore there should be justice throughout the world and then God look to the future and realize if the world be create just with justice the world could not exist so God think nope I be go to create the world just with compassion and then God look to the future and realize that in fact if the world be just fill with compassion there would be anarchy and chaos there have to be limit to all thing the rabbis describe this as be like a king who have a beautiful fragile glass bowl if you put too much cold water in it will shatter if you put boil water in it will shatter what do you have to do put in a mixture of the two and so God put both of this possibility into the world there be something more though that have to be there and that be the translation of the feeling that we may have about compassion into the wide world into action so like Snoopy we can not just lie there and think great thought about we neighbor we actually have to do something about it and so there be also within Judaism this notion of love and kindness that become very important chese all this three thing then have to be meld together the idea of justice which give boundary to we life and give we a feeling of what be right about life what be right about live what should we be do social justice there have to be a willingness to do good deed but not of course at the expense of we own sanity you know there be no way that you can do anything for anyone if you overdo thing and balance they all in the middle be this notion of compassion which have to be there if you like at we very root this idea of compassion come to we because we be make in the image of God who be ultimately the compassionate one what do this compassion entail it entail understand the pain of the other but even more than that it mean understand one connection to the whole of creation understanding that one be part of that creation that there be a unity that underlie all that we see all that we hear all that we feel I call that unity God and that unity be something that connect all of creation and of course in the modern world with the environmental movement we be become even more aware of the connectivity of thing that something I do here actually do matter in Africa that if I use too much of my carbon allowance it seem to be that we be cause a great lack of rain in central and eastern Africa so there be a connectivity and I have to understand that as part of the creation as part of I be make in the image of God and I have to understand that my need sometimes have to be sublimate to other need this 18 minute business I find quite fascinating because in Judaism the number 18 in hebrew letter stand for life the word life so in a sense the 18 minute be challenge I to say in life this be what be important in term of compassion but something else as well actually 18 minute be important because at Passover when we have to eat unleavened bread the rabbi say what be the difference between dough that be make into bread and dough that be make into unleavened bread or matzah and they say it be 18 minute because that be how long they say it take for this dough to become leaven what do it mean dough become leaven it mean it get fill with hot air what be matzah what be unleavened bread you do not get it symbolically what the rabbi say be that at Passover what we have to do be try to get rid of we hot air we pride we feel that we be the most important person in the whole entire world and that everything should revolve round we so we try and get rid of that and so do try to get rid of the habit the emotion the idea that enslave we that make we eye close give we tunnel vision so we do not see the need of other and free ourselves and free ourselves from that and that too be a basis for have compassion for understand we place in the world now there be in Judaism a gorgeous story of a rich man who sit in synagogue one day and as many person do he be doze off during the sermon and as he be doze off they be read from the book of Leviticus in the Torah and they be say that in the ancient time in the temple in Jerusalem the priest use to have bread which they use to place into a special table in the temple in Jerusalem the man be asleep but he hear the word bread temple God and he wake up he say God want bread that be it God want bread I know what God want and he rush home and after the Sabbath he make 12 loaf of bread take they to the synagogue go into the synagogue open the ark and say God I do not know why you want this bread but here you be and he put it in the ark with the scroll of the Torah then he go home the clean come into the synagogue oh god I be in such trouble I have get child to feed my wife ill I have get no money what can I do he go into the synagogue God will you please help I ah what a wonderful smell he go to the ark he open the ark there be bread God you have answer my plea you have answer my question take the bread and go home meanwhile the rich man think to himself I be a idiot God want bread God the one who rule the entire universe want my bread he rush to the synagogue I will get it out of the ark before anybody find it he go in there and it be not there and he say God you really do want it you want my bread next week with raisin this go on for year every week the man would bring bread with raisin with all sort of good thing put it into the ark every week the cleaner would come God you have answer my plea again take the bread take it home go on until a new rabbi come Rabbis always spoil thing the rabbi come in and see what be go on and he call the two of they to he office and he say you know this be what be happen and the rich man oh dear crestfallen you mean God do not want my bread and the poor man say and you mean God do not answer my plea and the rabbi say you have misunderstand I you have misunderstand totally he say of course what you be do he say to the rich man be answer God plea that we should be compassionate and God he say to the poor man be answer you plea that person should be compassionate and give he look at the rich man he hold the rich man hand and say do not you understand he say this be the hand of God so that be the way I feel that I can only try to approach this notion of be compassionate of understanding that there be a connectivity that there be a unity in this world that I want to try and serve that unity and that I can try and do that by understand I hope try to understand something of the pain of other but understanding that there be limit that person have to bear responsibility for some of the problem that come upon they and that I have to understand that there be limit to my energy to the giving I can give I have to reevaluate they try and separate out the material thing and my emotion that may be enslave I so that I can see the world clearly and then I have to try to see in what way I can make this the hand of God and so try to bring compassion to life in this world
