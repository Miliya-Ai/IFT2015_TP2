I love tree and I be very lucky because we live near a wonderful arboretum and sunday usually I would go there with my wife and now with my four year old and we would climb in the tree we have play hide and seek the second school I be at have big tree too have a fantastic tulip tree I think it be the big in the country and it also have a lot of wonderful bush and vegetation around it around the play field one day I be grab by some of my classmate and take in the bush I be strip I be attack I be abuse and this come out of the blue now the reason I say that because afterwards I be think well I go back into the school I feel dirty I feel betray I feel ashamed but mainly mainly I feel powerless and 30 year later I be sit in a airplane next to a lady call Veronica who come from Chile and we be on a human right tour and she be start to tell I what it be like to be torture and from my very privileged position this be the only reference point that I have and it be a amazing learning experience because for I human right have be something in which I have you know a part time interest but mainly it be something that happen to other person over there but I get a phone call from Bono in 1985 and as you know he be a great singer but he be a magnificent hustler and laughter a very hard guy to say no to and he be say you know just after I have do the Biko song we be go to do a tour for Amnesty you have to be on it and really that be the first time that I have be out and start meet person who have watch they family be shoot in front of they who have have a partner throw out of a airplane into a ocean and suddenly this world of human right arrive in my world and I could not really walk away in quite the same way as before so I get involve with this tour which be for Amnesty and then in 88 I take over Bono job try to learn how to hustle I do not do it as well but we manage to get Youssou N Dour Sting Tracy Chapman and Bruce Springsteen to go round the world for Amnesty and it be a amazing experience and once again I get a extraordinary education and it be the first time really that I have meet a lot of this person in the different country and this human right story become very physical and again I could not really walk away quite so comfortably but the thing that really amaze I that I have no idea be that you could suffer in this way and then have you whole experience you story deny bury and forget and it seem that whenever there be a camera around or a video or film camera it be a great deal hard to do for that in power to bury the story and Reebok set up a foundation after this Human Rights now tour and there be a decision then well we make a proposal for a couple of year about try to set up a division that be go to give camera to human right activist it do not really get anywhere and then the Rodney King incident happen and person think ok if you have a camera in the right place at the right time or perhaps the wrong time depend who you be then you can actually start do something and campaigning and be hear and tell person about what be go on so witness be start in 92 and it be since give camera out in over 60 country and we campaign with activist group and help they tell they story and in fact I will show you in a moment one of the most recent campaign and I be afraid it be a story from Uganda and although we have a wonderful story from Uganda yesterday this one be not quite so good in the north of Uganda there be something like 1 5 million internally displace person person who be not refugee in another country but because of the civil war which have be go on for about 20 year they have nowhere to live and 20 000 kid have be take away to become child soldier and the International Criminal Court be go after five of the leader of the now what be it call I forget the name of the of the army it be Lord Resistance Army I believe but the government also do not have a clean sheet so if we could run the first video music woman life in the camp be never simple even today life be difficult we stay because of the fear that what push we into the camp still exist back home text between two fire torture and displacement in Northern Uganda Man when we be at home it be kony rebel soldier disturb we at first we be safe in the camp but late the government soldier begin mistreat we a lot chant Jennifer a soldier walk onto the road ask where we have be Evelyn and I hide behind my mother Evelyn he order we to sit down so we sit down the other soldier also come Jennifer the man come and start undress I the other one carry Evelyn aside the one who be defile I then leave I and go to rape Evelyn and the one who be rape Evelyn come and defile I also Man the soldier with club this long beat we to get a confession they keep tell we tell the truth as they beat we woman they insist that I be lie at that moment they fire and shoot off my finger I fall they run to join the other leave I for dead music text Uganda ratify the convention against torture in 1986 torture be define as any act by which severe pain of suffer whether physical or mental be intentionally inflict by a person act in a official capacity to obtain information or a confession to punish coerce or intimidate Peter Gabriel so torture be not something that always happen on other soil in my country it be we have be look at picture of British soldier beat up young Iraqi we have get Abu Ghraib we have get Guantanamo Bay I have a driver on my way to Newark Airport and he tell I a story that in the middle of the night 4 a m he have be take out of he home in Queens take to a place in the Midwest that he be interrogate and torture and return to the street four week later because he have the same he be middle Eastern and he have the same name as one of the 9 11 pilot and that may or may not be true I do not think he be a liar though and I think if we look around the world as well as the polar ice cap melt human right which have be fight for for many hundred of year in some case be also erode very fast and that be something that we need to take a look at and maybe start campaign for I mean here too one of we partner be at Van Jones and the book not Bars project they have manage with they footage in California to change the youth correction system employ and it be much much I think more humane method be be look at how you should lock up young kid and that be questionable to start off and as the story of Mr Morales just down the road excuse I Mr Gabriel would you mind if we delay you execution a little bit no not at all no problem take you time but this surely whoever that man be whatever he be do this be cruel and unusual punishment anyway WITNESS have be try to arm the brave person who often put they life at risk around the world with camera and I would like to show you just a little more of that thank you Thunder text you can say a story be fabricate music text you can say a jury be corrupt you can say a person be lie you can say you do not trust newspaper but you can not say what you just see never happen help witness give camera to the world shoot a video expose injustice reveal the truth show we what be wrong with the world and maybe we can help make it right witness all the video you have just see be record by human right group work with witness applause pg witness be bear of technological innovation in a sense the small portable dv cam be really what allow it to come into be and we have also be try to get computer out to the world so that group can communicate much more effectively campaign much more effectively but now we have the wonderful possibility which be give to we from the mobile phone with the camera in it because that be cheap it be ubiquitous and it be move fast all around the world and it be very exciting for we and so the dream be that we could have a world in which anyone who have anything bad happen to they of this sort have a chance of get they story upload be see be watch that they really know that they can be hear that there would be a giant website maybe a little like Google Earth and you could fly over and find out the reality of what be go for the world inhabitant in a way what this technology be allow be really that a lot of the problem of the world can have a human face that we can actually see who be die of AIDS or who be be beat up for the first time and we can hear they story in a way that the blogger culture if we can move that into this sort of field I think we can really transform the world in all sort of way there could be a new movement grow up rise from the ground reach for the light and grow strong just like a tree thank you
