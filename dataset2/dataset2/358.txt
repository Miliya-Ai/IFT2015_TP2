what I think I would talk about today be the transition from one mode of think about nature to another that be track by architecture what be interesting about architect be we always have try to justify beauty by look to nature and arguably beautiful architecture have always be look at a model of nature so for roughly 300 year the hot debate in architecture be whether the number five or the number seven be a good proportion to think about architecture because the nose be one fifth of you head or because you head be one seventh of you body and the reason that that be the model of beauty and of nature be because the decimal point have not be invent yet it be not the 16th century and everybody have to dimension a building in term of fraction so a room would be dimension as one fourth of a facade the structural dais of that might be dimension as 10 unit and you would get down to the small element by fractional subdivision fine and fine and fine in the 15th century the decimal point be invent architect stop use fraction and they have a new model of nature so what be go on today be that there be a model of natural form which be calculus base and which be use digital tool and that have a lot of implication to the way we think about beauty and form and it have a lot of implication in the way we think about nature the good example of this would probably be the Gothic and the Gothic be invent after the invention of calculus although the Gothic architect be not really use calculus to define they form but what be important be the Gothic moment in architecture be the first time that force and motion be think of in term of form so example like Christopher Wren King Cross you can see that the structural force of the vault get articulate as line so you be really actually see the expression of structural force and form much later Robert Maillart bridge which optimize structural form with a calculus curvature almost like a parabola the hang chain model of Antonio Gaudi the Catalan architect the end of the 19th century beginning of the 20th century and how that hang chain model translate into archway and vault so in all of this example structure be the determine force Frei Otto be start to use foam bubble diagram and foam bubble model to generate he Mannheim Concert Hall interestingly in the last 10 year Norman Foster use a similar heat thermal transfer model to generate the roof of the National Gallery with the structural engineer Chris Williams in all this example there be one ideal form because this be think in term of structure and as a architect I have always find this kind of system very limit because I be not interested in ideal form and I be not interested in optimize to some perfect moment so what I think I would bring up be another component that need to be think of whenever you think about nature and that be basically the invention of generic form in genetic evolution my hero be actually not Darwin it be a guy name William Bateson father of Greg Bateson who be here for a long time in Monterey and he be what you would call a teratologist he look at all of the monstrosity and mutation to find rule and law rather than look at the norm so instead of try to find the ideal type or the ideal average he have always look for the exception so in this example which be a example of what be call Bateson rule he have two kind of mutation of a human thumb when I first see this image 10 year ago I actually find it very strange and beautiful at the same time beautiful because it have symmetry so what he find be that in all case of thumb mutation instead of have a thumb you would either get another opposable thumb or you would get four finger so the mutation revert to symmetry and Bateson invent the concept of symmetry breaking which be that wherever you lose information in a system you revert back to symmetry so symmetry be not the sign of order and organization which be what I be always understand and as be a architect symmetry be the absence of information so whenever you lose information you would move to symmetry whenever you add information to a system you would break symmetry so this whole idea of natural form shift at that moment from look for ideal shape to look for a combination of information and generic form you know literally after see that image and find out what Bateson be work with we start to use this rule for symmetry breaking and branching to start to think about architectural form to just talk for a minute about the digital medium that we be use now and how they integrate calculus the fact that they be calculus base mean that we do not have to think about dimension in term of ideal unit or discreet element so in architecture we deal with big assembly of component so there might be up to say 50 000 piece of material in this room you be sit in right now that all need to get organize now typically you would think that they would all be the same like the chair you be sit in would all be the same dimension you know I have not verify this but it be the norm that every chair would be a slightly different dimension because you would want to space they all out for everybody sight line the element that make up the ceiling grid and the lighting they be all lose they modular quality and move more and more to this infinitesimal dimension that be because we be all use calculus tool for manufacturing and for design calculus be also a mathematics of curve so even a straight line define with calculus be a curve it be just a curve without inflection so a new vocabulary of form be now pervade all design field whether it be automobile architecture product etc it be really be affect by this digital medium of curvature the intricacy of scale that come out of that you know in the example of the nose to the face there be a fractional part to whole idea with calculus the whole idea of subdivision be more complex because the whole and the part be one continuous series it be too early in the morning for a lecture on calculus so I bring some image to just describe how that work this be a Korean church that we do in Queens and in this example you can see that the component of this stair be repetitive but they be repetitive without be modular each one of the element in this structure be a unique distance and dimension and all of the connection be unique angle now the only way we could design that or possibly construct it be by use a calculus base definition of the form it also be much more dynamic so that you can see that the same form open and close in a very dynamic way as you move across it because it have this quality of vector in motion build into it so the same space that appear to be a kind of closed volume when see from the other side become a kind of open vista and you also get a sense of visual movement in the space because every one of the element be change in a pattern so that pattern lead you eye towards the altar I think that be one of the main change also in architecture that we be start to look now not for some ideal form like a latin cross for a church but actually all the trait of a church so light that come from behind from a invisible source directionality that focus you towards a altar it turn out it be not rocket science to design a sacred space you just need to incorporate a certain number of trait in a very kind of genetic way so this be the different perspective of that interior which have a very complex set of orientation all in a simple form in term of construction and manufacture this be a kilometer long housing block that be build in the 70 in Amsterdam and here we have break the 500 apartment up into small neighborhood and differentiate that neighborhood I will not go into too much description of any of this project but what you can see be that the escalator and elevator that circulate person along the face of the building be all hold up by 122 structural truss because we be use escalator to move person all of this truss be pick up diagonal load so every one of they be a little bit different shape as you move down the length of the building so work with Bentley and MicroStation we have write a custom piece of software that network all of the component together into this chunk of information so that if we change any element along the length of the building not only do that change distribute through each one of the truss but each one of the truss then distribute that information down the length of the entire facade of the building so it be a single calculation for every single component of the building that we be add onto so it be ten of million of calculation just to design one connection between a piece of structural steel and another piece of structural steel but what it give we be a harmonic and synthesize relationship of all this component one to another this idea have kind of bring I into do some product design and it be because design firm that have connection to architect like I be work with Vitra which be a furniture company and Alessi which be a houseware company they see this actually solve a problem this ability to differentiate component but keep they synthetic so not to pick on BMW or to celebrate they but take BMW as a example they have to in 2005 have a distinct identity for all they model of car so the 300 series or whatever they new car be the 100 series that be come out have to look like the 700 series at the other end of they product line so they need a distinct coherent identity which be BMW at the same time there be a person pay 30 000 dollar for a 300 series car and a person pay 70 000 dollar for a 700 series and that person pay more than double do not want they car to look too much like the bottom of the market car so they have to also discriminate between this product so as manufacturing start to allow more design option this problem get exacerbate of the whole and the part now as a architect part to whole relationship be all I think about but in term of product design it be become more and more of a issue for company so the first kind of test product we do be with Alessi which be for a coffee and tea set it be a incredibly expensive coffee and tea set we know that at the beginning so I actually go to some person I know down south in San Diego and we use a explode titanium form method that be use in the aerospace industry basically what we can do be just cut a graphite mold put it in a oven heat it to 1 000 degree gently inflate titanium that be soft and then explode it at the last minute into this form but what be great about it be the form be only a few hundred dollar the titanium several thousand dollar but the form be very cheap so we design a system here of eight curve that could be swap very similar to that housing project I show you and we could recombine that together so that we always have ergonomic shape that always have the same volume and could always be produce in the same way that way each one of this tool we could pay for with a few hundred dollar and get incredible variation in the component and this be one of that example of the set so for I what be important be that this coffee set which be just a coffee pot a teapot and that be the pot sit on a tray that they would have a coherence so they would be Greg Lynn Alessi coffee pot but that everyone who buy one would have a one of a kind object that be unique in some way to go back to architecture what be organic about architecture as a field unlike product design be this whole issue of holism and of monumentality be really we realm like we have to design thing which be coherent as a single object but also break down into small room and have a identity of both the big scale and the small scale architect tend to work with signature so that a architect need a signature and that signature have to work across the scale of house up to say skyscraper and that problem of signature be a thing we be very good at maintain and work with and intricacy which be the relationship of say the shape of a build its structure its window its color its pattern this be real architectural problem so my kind of hero for this in the natural world be this tropical frog I get interested in they because they be the most extreme example of a surface where the texture and the let call it the decoration I know the frog do not think of it as decoration but that be how it work be all intricately connect to one another so a change in the form indicate a change in the color pattern so the pattern and the form be not the same thing but they really work together and be fuse in some way so when do a center for the national park in Costa Rica we try to use that idea of a gradient color and a change in texture as the structure move across the surface of the building we also use a continuity of change from a main exhibition hall to a natural history museum so it be all one continuous change in the massing but within that massing be very different kind of space and form in a housing project in Valencia Spain we be do the different tower of housing fuse together in share curve so you get a single mass like a kind of monolith but it break down into individual element and you can see that that change in massing also give all 48 of the apartment a unique shape and size but always within a kind of control limit a envelope of change I work with a group of other architect we have a company call United Architects we be one of the finalist for the World Trade Center site design and I think this just show how we be approach the problem of incredibly large scale construction we want to make a kind of Gothic cathedral around the footprint of the World Trade Center site and to do that we try to connect up the five tower into a single system and we look at from the 1950 on there be numerous example of other architect try to do the same thing we really approach it at the level of the typology of the building where we could build this five separate tower but they would all join at the 60th floor and make a kind of single monolithic mass with United Architects also we make a proposal for the European Central Bank headquarters that use the same system but this time in a much more monolithic mass like a sphere but again you can see this kind of organic fusion of multiple building element to make a thing which be whole but break down into small part but in a incredibly organic way finally I would like to just show you some of the effect of use digital fabrication about six year ago I buy one of this cnc mill to just replace kind of young person cut they finger off all the time build model and I also buy a laser cutter and start to fabricate within my own shop kind of large scale building element and model where we could go directly to the tool what I find out be that the tooling if you intervene in the software actually produce decorative effect so for this interior like this shop in Stockholm Sweden or this installation wall in the Netherlands at the Netherlands Architecture Institute we could use the texture that the tool would leave to produce a lot of the spatial effect and we could integrate the texture of the wall with the form of the wall with the material so in vacuum form plastic in fiberglass and then even at the level of structural steel which you think of as be linear and modular the steel industry be so far ahead of the design industry that if you take advantage of it you can even start to think of beam and column all roll together into a single system which be highly efficient but also produce decorative effect and formal effect that be very beautiful and organic thanks very much
