Sergey Brin I want to discuss a question I know that be be press on many of you mind we speak to you last several year ago and before I get start today since many of you be wonder I just want to get it out of the way the answer be boxer now I hope all of you feel well do you know what this might be do anyone know what that be Audience Yes SB what be it audience it be person log on to Google around the world sb wow ok I do not really realize what it be when I first see it but this be what help I see it this be what we run at the office that actually run real time here it be slightly log but here you can see around the world how person be use Google and every one of that rise dot represent probably about 20 30 search or something like that and they be label by color right now by language so you can see here we be in the U S and they be all come up red there we be in Monterey hopefully I can get it right you can see that Japan be busy at night right there we have Tokyo come in in Japanese there be a lot of activity in China there be a lot of activity in India there be some in the Middle East the little pocket and Europe which be right now in the middle of the day be go really strong with a whole wide variety of language now you can also see if I turn this around here hopefully I will not shake the world too much but you can also see there be place where there be not so much Australia because there just be not very many person there and this be something that we should really work on which be Africa which be just a few trickle basically in South Africa and a few other urban city but basically what we have notice be this query which come in at thousand per second be available everywhere there be power and pretty much everywhere there be power there be the internet and even in Antarctica well at least this time of year we from time to time will see a query rise up and if we have it plot correctly I think the International Space Station would have it too so this be some of the challenge that we have here be you can see that it be actually kind of hard to get the there we go this be how we have to move the bit around to actually get the person the answer to they question you can see that there be a lot of datum run around it have to go all over the world through fiber through satellite through all kind of connection and it be pretty tricky for we to maintain the latency as low as we try to hopefully you experience be good but you can see also once again so some place be much more wired than other and you can see all the bandwidth across the U S go up over to Asia Europe in the other direction and so forth now what I would like to do be just to show you what one second of this activity would look like and if we can switch to slide all right here we go so this be slow down this be what one second look like and this be what we spend a lot of we time do be just make sure that we can keep up with this kind of traffic load now each one of that query have a interesting life and tale of its own I mean it could be somebody health it could be somebody career something important to they and it could potentially be something as important as tomato sauce or in this case ketchup so this be a query that we have I guess it be a popular band that be more popular in some part of the world than other you can see that it get start right here in the U S and Spain it be popular at the same time but it do not have quite the same pickup in the U S as it do in Spain and then from Spain it go to Italy and then Germany get excited and maybe right now the u k be enjoy it and so I guess the U S finally finally start to like it too and I just want to play it for you anyway you can all enjoy it for yourselve hopefully that search will work as a part of you know part of what we want to do to grow we company be to have more search and what that mean be we want to have more person who be healthy and educate more animal if they start do search as well but partly we want to make the world a good place and so one thing that we be embark upon be the Google Foundation and we be in the process of set that up we also have a program already call Google Grants that now serve over 150 different charity around the world and this be some of the charity that be on there and it be something I be very excited to be a part of in fact many of the organization that be here the Acumen Fund I think approtec we have run I be not sure if that one up yet and many of the person who have present here be run through Google Grants they run Google ad and we just give they the ad credit so they can let organization know one of the early result that we get we have a Singaporean businessman who be now sponsor a village of 25 Vietnamese girl for they education and that be one of the early result and as I say now there have be many many story that have come in because we do have hundred of charity in there and the Google Foundation will be a even broad endeavor now do anybody know who this be a ha audience Orkut SB Yes somebody get it this be Orkut be anybody here on Orkut do we have any okay not very many person know about it I will explain it in a second this be one of we engineer we find that they work well when they be submerge and cover with leaf that be how we churn that product out Orkut have a vision to create a social network I know all of you be think yet another social network but it be a dream of he and we basically when person really want to do something well we generally let they so this be what he build we just release it in a test phase last month and it be be take off this be we vp of Engineering you can see the red hair and I do not know if you can see the nose ring there and this be all of he friend so this be how we just deploy it we just decide that person would send each other invitation to get into the service and so we just have the person in we company initially send they out and now we have grow to over 100 000 member and they spread actually very quickly even outside the U S you can see even though the U S be still the majority here though by the way search wise it be only about 30 percent of we traffic but it be already go to Japan and the U K and Europe and all the rest of the country so it be a fun little project there be a variety of demographic I will not bear you with this but it be just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun and see where it go and well I will leave you in suspense Larry you can explain this one Larry Page thank you Sergey so one of the thing both Sergey and I go to a Montessori school and I think for some reason this have be incorporate in Google and Sergey mention Orkut which be something that you know Orkut want to do in he time and we call this at Google we have embody this as the 20 percent time and the idea be for 20 percent of you time if you be work at Google you can do what you think be the good thing to do and many many thing at Google have come out of that such as Orkut and also Google News and I think many other thing in the world also have come out of this Mendel who be suppose to be teach high school student actually you know discover the law of genetics as a hobby basically so many many useful thing come out of this and News which I just mention be start by a researcher and he just he after 9 11 he get really interested in the news and he say why do not I look at the news well and so he start cluster it by category and then he start use it and then he friend start use it and then besides just look cute on a baby bottom we make it a Googlette which be basically a small project at Google so it would be like three person or something like that and they would try to make a product and we would not really be sure if it be go to work or not and in News case you know they have a couple of person work on it for a while and then more and more person start use it and then we put it out on the internet and more and more person start use it and now it be a real full blow project with more person on it and this be how we keep we innovation run I think usually as company get big they find it really hard to have small innovative project and we have this problem too for a while and we say oh we really need a new concept you know the googlette that be a small project that we be not quite sure if it be go to work or not but we hope it will and if we do enough of they some of they will really work and turn out such as News but then we have a problem because then we have over 100 project and I do not know about all of you but I have trouble keep 100 thing in my head at once and we find that if we just write all of they down and order they and this be kind of make up do not really pay attention to they for example the Buy Iceland be from a media article we would never do such a crazy thing but in any case we find if we just basically write they all down and order they that most person would actually agree what the ordering should be and this be kind of a surprise to I but we find that as long as you keep the 100 thing in you head which you do by write they down that you could do a pretty good job decide what to do and where to put you resource and so that be basically what we have do since we institute that a few year ago and I think it have really allow we to be innovative and still stay reasonably well organize the other thing we discover be that person like to work on thing that be important and so naturally person sort of migrate to the thing that be high priority I just want to highlight a couple of thing that be new or you might not know about and the top thing actually be the Deskbar so this be a new how many of you use the Google Toolbar raise you hand how many of you use the Deskbar All right see you guy should try it out but if you go to we site and search for Deskbar you will get this and the idea be instead of a toolbar it be just present all the time on you screen on the bottom and you can do search really easily and it be sort of like a good version of the toolbar thank you Sergey this be another example of a project that somebody at Google be really passionate about and they just they get go and it be really really a great product and really take off Google answer be something we start which be really cool which let you for five to 100 dollar you can type a question in and then there be a pool of researcher that go out and research it for you and it be guarantee and all that and you can get actually very good answer to thing without spend all that time yourself froogle let you search shop information and Blogger let you publish thing but all of this well this be all sort of innovative thing that we do that you know we try many many different thing in we company we also like to innovate in we physical space and we notice in meeting you know you have to wait a long time for projector to turn on and off and they be noisy so person shut they off and we do not like that so we actually in maybe a couple of week we build this little enclosure that enclose the projector and so we can leave they on all the time and they be completely silent and as a result we be able to build some software that also let we manage a meeting so when you walk into a meeting room now it list all the meeting that be happen you can very easily take note and they just get email automatically to all the person that be present in the meeting and as we become more of a global company we find this thing really affect we you know can we work effectively with person who be not in the room and thing like that and simple thing like this can really make a big difference we also have a lot of engineer in that meeting and they do not always do they laundry as much as they should and so we find it be pretty helpful to have laundry machine for we young employee especially and we also allow dog and thing like that and we have have I think a really fun culture at we company which help person work and enjoy what they be do this be actually we cult picture I just want to show quickly we have this on we website for a while but we find that after we put it on we website we do not get any job application anymore but anyway every year we have take the whole company on a ski trip a lot of work happen in company from person know each other and informally and I think we have do a good job encourage that it make it a really fun place to work along with we logo too which I think really embody we culture when we change thing in the early day we be actually advise we should never change we logo because we should establish we brand you know because you know you would never want to change you logo you want it to be consistent and we say well that do not sound so much fun why do not we try change it every day one of the thing that really excite I about what we be do now be we have this thing call AdSense and this be a little bit foreshadow this be from before Dean drop out but the idea be like on a newspaper for example we show you relevant ad and this be hard to read but this say battle for New Hampshire Howard Dean for President article on Howard Dean and this ad be generate automatically like in this case on the Washington Post from the content on the site and so we use we over 150 000 advertiser and million of advertisement so we pick the one that be most relevant to what you be actually look at much as we do on search so the idea be we can make advertising useful not just annoying right and the nice thing about this we have a self serve program and many thousand of website have sign up and this let they really make money and I you know there be a number of person I meet I meet this guy who run a conservation site at a party and he say you know I be not make any money I just put this thing on my site and I be make 10 000 dollar a month and you know thank you I do not have to do my other job now and I think this be really important for we because it make the internet work well it make content get good it make search work well when person can really make they livelihood from produce great content so this session be suppose to be about the future so I have think I would talk at least briefly about it and the idea behind this be to do the perfect job do search you really have to be smart because you can type you know any kind of thing into Google and you expect a answer back right but find thing be tricky and so you really want intelligence and in fact the ultimate search engine would be smart it would be artificial intelligence and so that be something we work on and we even have some person who be excited enough and crazy enough to work on it now and that be really they goal so we always hope that Google will be smart but we be always surprised when other person think that it be and so I just want to give a funny example of this this be a blog from Iraq and it be not really what I be go to talk about but I just want to show you a example maybe Sergey you can highlight this so we decide actually the highlight right there oh thank you so related search right there you can not see it that well but we decide we should put in this feature into we adsense ad call relate search and so we would say you know do you mean search for what be this in this case Saddam Hussein because this blog be about Iraq and you know in addition to the ad and we think this would be a great idea and so there be this blog of a young person who be kind of depressed and he say you know I be sleep a lot he be just kind of write about he life and we algorithm not a person of course but we algorithm we computer read he blog and decide that the relate search be I be bored and he read this and he think a person have decide that he be boring and it be very unfortunate and he say you know what be this you know bastard at Google do why do not they like my blog and so then we read he blog which be get you know sort of go from bad to bad and we say the relate search be Retards and then you know he get even more mad and he write like start swear and so on and then we produce you suck and finally it end with kiss my ass and so basically he think he be deal with something smart and of course you know we just sort of write this program and we try it out and it do not quite work and we do not have this feature anymore so with that maybe I can switch back to the world I want to end just by say that there be a couple thing that really make I excited to be involve with Google and one of that be that we be able to make money largely through advertising and one of the benefit that I do not expect from that be that we be able to serve everyone in the world without worry about you know place that do not have as much money so we do not have to worry about we product be sell for example for less money in place that be poor and then they get re import into the U S for example with the drug industry and I think we be really lucky to have that kind of business model because everyone in the world have access to we search and I think that be a tremendous tremendous benefit the other thing I want to mention just briefly be that we have a tremendous ability and responsibility to provide person the right information and we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine that we should provide very objective information and so in we search result we never accept payment for we search result we accept payment for advertising and we mark it as such and that be unlike many of we competitor and I think decision we be able to make like that have a tremendous impact on the world and it make I really proud to be involve with Google so thank you
