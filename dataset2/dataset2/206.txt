good morning let look for a minute at the great icon of all Leonardo da Vinci we be all familiar with he fantastic work he draw he paint he invention he writings but we do not know he face thousand of book have be write about he but there be controversy and it remain about he look even this well know portrait be not accept by many art historian so what do you think be this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or be not it let find out Leonardo be a man that draw everything around he he draw person anatomy plant animal landscape building water everything but no face I find that hard to believe he contemporary make face like the one you see here en face or three quarter so surely a passionate drawer like Leonardo must have make self portrait from time to time so let try to find they I think that if we be to scan all of he work and look for self portrait we would find he face look at we so I look at all of he draw more than 700 and look for male portrait there be about 120 you see they here which one of this could be self portrait well for that they have to be do as we just see en face or three quarter so we can eliminate all the profile it also have to be sufficiently detail so we can also eliminate the one that be very vague or very stylized and we know from he contemporary that Leonardo be a very handsome even beautiful man so we can also eliminate the ugly one or the caricature laughter and look what happen only three candidate remain that fit the bill and here they be yes indeed the old man be there as be this famous pen drawing of the Homo Vitruvianus and lastly the only portrait of a male that Leonardo paint the musician before we go into this face I should explain why I have some right to talk about they I have make more than 1 100 portrait myself for newspaper over the course of 300 30 year sorry 30 year only laughter but there be 1 100 and very few artist have draw so many face so I know a little about drawing and analyze face ok now let look at this three portrait and hold onto you seat because if we zoom in on that face remark how they have the same broad forehead the horizontal eyebrow the long nose the curved lip and the small well developed chin I could not believe my eye when I first see that there be no reason why this portrait should look alike all we do be look for portrait that have the characteristic of a self portrait and look they be very similar now be they make in the right order the young man should be make first and as you see here from the year that they be create it be indeed the case they be make in the right order what be the age of Leonardo at the time do that fit yes it do he be 33 38 and 63 when this be make so we have three picture potentially of the same person of the same age as Leonardo at the time but how do we know it be he and not someone else well we need a reference and here be the only picture of Leonardo that be widely accept it be a statue make by Verrocchio of David for which Leonardo pose as a boy of 15 and if we now compare the face of the statue with the face of the musician you see the very same feature again the statue be the reference and it connect the identity of Leonardo to that three face lady and gentleman this story have not yet be publish it be only proper that you here at TED hear and see it first the icon of icon finally have a face here he be Leonardo da Vinci applause
