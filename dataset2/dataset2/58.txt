so my grandfather tell I when I be a little girl if you say a word often enough it become you and have grow up in a segregated city Baltimore Maryland I sort of use that idea to go around America with a tape recorder thank God for technology to interview person think that if I walk in they word which be also why I do not wear shoe when I perform if I walk in they word that I could sort of absorb America I be also inspire by Walt Whitman who want to absorb America and have it absorb he so this four character be go to be from that work that I have be do for many year now and well over I do not know a couple of thousand person I have interview anybody out here old enough to know Studs Terkel that old radio man so I think he would be the perfect person to go to to ask about a define moment in American history you know he be bear in 1912 the year the Titanic sink great ship every build hit the tip of a iceberg and bam it go down it go down and I come up wow some century laughter so this be he answer about a define moment in American history define moment in American history I do not think there be one you can not say Hiroshima that be a big one I can not think of any one moment I would say be a define moment the gradual slippage slippage be the word use by the person in Watergate moral slippage it be a gradual kind of thing combination of thing you see we also have the technology I say less and less the human touch oh let I kind of tell you a funny little play bit the Atlanta airport be a modern airport and they should leave the gate there this train that take you out to a concourse and on to a destination and this train be smooth and they be quiet and they be efficient and there be a voice on the train you know the voice be a human voice you see in the old day we have robot robot imitate human now we have human imitate robot so we get this voice on this train Concourse one Omaha Lincoln Concourse two Dallas Fort Worth same voice just as a train be about to go a young couple rush in and they be just about to close the pneumatic door and that voice without lose a beat say because of late entry we be delay 30 second just then everybody be look at this couple with hateful eye and the couple be go like this you know shrink well I would happen to have have a couple of drink before boarding I do that to steel my nerve and so I imitate a train call hold my hand on my George Orwell you time have come you see well some of you be laugh everybody laugh when I say that but not on this train silence and so suddenly they be look at I so here I be with the couple the three of we shrink at the foot of Calvary about to be up you know just then I see a baby a little baby in the lap of a mother I know it be Hispanic because she be speak Spanish to she companion so I be go to talk to the baby so I say to the baby hold my hand over my mouth because my breath must be 100 proof I say to the baby Sir or Madam what be you consider opinion of the human species and the baby look you know the way baby look at you clearly start laugh start bust out with this crazy little laugh I say thank God for a human reaction we have not lose yet but you see the human touch you see it be disappear you know you see you have get to question the official truth you know the thing that be so great about Mark Twain you know we honor Mark Twain but we do not read he we read Huck Finn of course we read Huck Finn of course I mean Huck of course be tremendous remember that great scene on the raft remember what Huck do you see here be Huck he be a illiterate kid he be have no schooling but there be something in he and the official truth the truth be the law be that a black man be a property be a thing you see and Huck get on the raft with a property name Jim a slave see and he hear that Jim be go to go and take he wife and kid and steal they from the woman who own they and Huck say ooh oh my God ooh ooh that woman that woman never do anybody any harm ooh he be go to steal he be go to steal he be go to do a terrible thing just then two slaver catch up guy chase slave look for Jim anybody up on that raft with you Huck say yeah be he black or white White and they go off and Huck say oh my God oh my god I lie I lie ooh I do a terrible thing do a terrible thing why do I feel so good but it be the goodness of Huck that stuff that Huck be be make of you see all be bury it be all be bury so the human touch you see it be disappear so you ask about a define moment be not no defining moment in American history for I it be a accretion of moment that add up to where we be now where trivia become news and more and more less and less awareness of the pain of the other huh you know I do not know if you could use this or not but I be quote Wright Morris a writer from Nebraska who say we be more and more into communication and less and less into communication okay kid I get to scram get to go see my cardiologist and that be Studs Terkel applause so talk about risk taking I be go to do somebody that nobody like you know most actor want to do character that be likeable well not always but the notion especially at a conference like this I like to inspire person but since this be call risk taking I be do somebody who I never do because she be so unlikeable that one person actually come backstage and tell I to take she out of the show she be in and I be do she because I think we think of risk at a conference like this as a good thing but there be certain other connotation to the word risk and the same thing about the word nature what be nature Maxine Greene who be a wonderful philosopher who be as old as stud and be the head of a philosophy great big philosophy kind of a organization I go to she and ask she what be the two thing that she do not know that she still want to know and she say well personally I still feel like I have to curtsey when I see the president of my university and I still feel as though I have get to get coffee for my male colleague even though I have outlive most of they and she say and then intellectually I do not know enough about the negative imagination and September 11th certainly teach we that that be a whole area we do not investigate so this piece be about a negative imagination it raise question about what nature be what Mother Nature be and about what a risk can be and I get this in the Maryland Correctional Institute for Women Everything I do be word for word off a tape and I title thing because I think person speak in organic poem and this be call a Mirror to she Mouth and this be a inmate name Paulette Jenkins I begin to learn how to cover it up because I do not want nobody to know that this be happen in my home I want everybody to think we be a normal family I mean we have all the materialistic thing but that do not make my child pain any less that do not make they fear subside I run out of excuse about how we get black eye and busted lip and bruise I do not have no more excuse and he beat I too but that do not change the fact that it be a nightmare for my family it be a nightmare and I fail they dramatically because I allow it to go on and on and on but the night that Myesha get kill and the intensity just grow and grow and grow until one night we come home from get drug and he get angry with Myesha and he start beat she and he put she in a bathtub oh he would use a belt he have a belt because he have this warped perverted thing that Myesha be have sex with she little brother and they be fondle each other that would be he reason I be just talk about the particular night that she die and so he put she in the bathtub and I be in the bedroom with the baby and four month before this happen four month before Myesha die I think I could really fix this man so I have a baby by he insane thinking that if I give he he own kid he would leave mine alone and it do not work do not work and I end up with three child Houston Myesha and Dominic who be four month old when I come to jail and I be in the bedroom like I say he have she in the bathroom and he he every time he hit she she would fall and she would hit she head on the tub it happen continuously repeatedly I could hear it but I dare not to move I do not move I do not even go and see what be happen I just sit there and listen and then he put she in the hallway he tell she just set there and so she set there for about four or five hour and then he tell she get up and when she get up she say she could not see she face be bruise she have a black eye all around she head be just swell she head be about two size of its own size I tell he let she go to sleep he let she go to sleep the next morning she be dead he go in to check on she for school and he get very excited he say she will not breathe I know immediately that she be dead I do not even want to accept the fact that she be dead so I go in and I put a mirror to she mouth there be no thing nothing come out of she mouth he say he say he say we can not we can not let nobody find out about this he say you have get to help I I agree I agree I mean I have be keep a secret for year and year and year so it just seem like second hand to I just to keep on keep it a secret so we go to the mall and we tell a police that we have like lose she that she be miss we tell a security guard that she be miss though she be not miss and we tell the security guard what we have put on she and we go home and we dress she in exactly the same thing that we have tell the security guard that we have put on she and then we get the baby and my other child and we drive out to like I 95 I be so petrified and so numb all I could look be in the rear view mirror and he just lay she right on the shoulder of the highway my own child I let that happen to so that be a investigation of the negative imagination applause when I start this project call on the Road A Search for a American character with my tape recorder I think that I be go to go around America and find it in all its aspect bull rider cowboy pig farmer drum majorette but I sort of get trip on race relation because my first big show be a show about a race riot and so I go to both two race riot one of which be the Los Angeles riot and this next piece be from that because this be what I would say I have learn the most about race relation from this piece it be a kind of a aria I would say and in many tape that I have everybody know that the Los Angeles riot happen because four cop beat up a black man name Rodney King it be capture on videotape technology and it be play all over the world everybody think the four cop would go to jail they do not so there be riot and what a lot of person forget be there be a second trial order by George Bush Sr and that trial come back with two cop go to jail and two cop declare innocent I be at that trial and I mean the person just dance in the street because they be afraid there be go to be another riot explosion of joy that this verdict have come back this way so there be a community that do not the Korean American whose store have be burn to the ground and so this woman Mrs Young soon Han I suppose will have teach I the most that I have learn about race and she ask also a question that stud talk about this notion of the official truth to question the official truth so what she be question here she be take a chance and question what justice be in society and this be call swallow the bitterness I use to believe America be the good I watch in Korea many luxurious Hollywood lifestyle movie I never see any poor man any black until 1992 I use to believe America be the good I still do I do not deny that because I be a victim but at the end of 92 when we be in such turmoil and have all the financial problem and all the mental problem I begin to really realize that Korean be completely leave out of this society and we be nothing why why do we have to be leave out we do not qualify for medical treatment no food stamp no GR no welfare anything many African American who never work get minimum amount of money to survive we do not get any because we have a car and a house and we be high taxpayer where do I find justice ok ok ok ok many African American probably think that they win by the trial I be sit here watch they the morning after the verdict and all the day they be have a party they celebrate all of South Central all the church and they say well finally justice have be do in this society well what about victim right they get they right by destroy innocent Korean merchant they have a lot of respect as I do for Dr Martin King he be the only model for black community I do not care Jesse Jackson he be the model of non violence non violence and they would all like to be in he spirit but what about 1992 they destroy innocent person and I wonder if that be really justice for they to get they right in that way I be swallow the bitterness sit here alone and watch they they become so hilarious but I be happy for they I be glad for they at least they get something back ok let just forget about Korean victim and other victim who be destroy by they they fight for they right for over two century and maybe because they sacrifice other minority Hispanic Asian we would suffer more in the mainstream that be why I understand that be why I have a mixed feeling about the verdict but I wish that I wish that I wish that I could be part of the enjoyment I wish that I could live together with black person but after the riot it be too much difference the fire be still there how do you say it unclear igniting ignite ignite fire ignite fire it be still there it can burst out anytime Mrs Young soon Han applause the other reason that I do not wear shoe be just in case I really feel like I have to cuddle up and get into the foot of somebody walk really in somebody else shoe and I tell you that in you know I do not give you the year but in 79 I think that I be go to go around and find bull rider and pig farmer and person like that and I get sidetrack on race relation finally I do find a bull rider two year ago and I have be go to the rodeo with he and we have bond and he be the lead in a op ed I do about the Republican Convention he be a Republican I will not say anything about my party affiliation but anyway so this be my dear dear Brent Williams and this be on toughness in case anybody need to know about be tough for the work that you do I think there be a real lesson in this and this be call Toughness well I be a optimist I mean basically I be a optimist I mean you know I mean it be like my wife Jolene she family always say you know you ever think he be just a bear loser it seem like he have so much bad luck you know but then when that bull step on my kidney you know I do not lose my kidney I could have lose my kidney I keep my kidney so I do not think I be a bear loser I think that be good luck laughter and I mean funny thing like this happen I be in a doctor office last cat scan and there be a reader Digest October 2002 it be like seven way to get lucky and it say if you want to get lucky you know you have get to be around positive person I mean like even when I tell my wife that you want to come out here and talk to I she be like she be just talk she be just be nice to you she be not go to do that and then you call I up and you say you want to come out here and interview I and she go and look you up on the internet she say look who she be you be not even go to be able to answer she question laughter and she be say you be go to make I look like a idiot because I have never be to college and I would not be talk professional or anything I say well look the woman talk to I for four hour you know if I be not talk you know like you know she want I to talk I do not think she would even come out here confidence well I think I ride more out of determination than confidence I mean confidence be like you know you have be on that bull before you know you can ride he I mean confidence be kind of like be cocky but in a good way but determination you know it be like just you know fuck the form get the horn laughter that be Tuff Hedeman in the movie 8 second I mean like Pat O Mealey always say when I be a boy he say you know you get more try than any kid I ever see and try and determination be the same thing determination be like you be go to hang on that bull even if you be ride upside down determination like you be go to ride till you head hit the back of the dirt freedom it would have to be the rodeo beauty I do not think I know what beauty be well you know I guess that would have to be the rodeo too I mean look how we be the roughy family pall around and shake hand and wrestle around I it be like you know rack up we credit card on entry fee and gas we ride together we you know we we eat together and we sleep together I mean I can not even imagine what it be go to be like the last day i rodeo I mean I will be alright I mean I have my ranch and everything but I actually do not even want to think the day that come I mean I guess it just be like I guess it be like the day my brother die Toughness well we be in West Jordan Utah and this bull shove my face right through the metal shoot in a you know bust my face all up and have to go to the hospital and they have to sew I up and straighten my nose out and I have to go and ride in the rodeo that night so I do not want they to put I under anesthesia or whatever you call it and so they sew my face up and then they have to straighten out my nose and they take this rod and shove they up my nose and go up through my brain and feel like it be come out the top of my head and everybody say that it should have kill I but it do not because I guess I have a high tolerance for pain laughter but the good thing be once they shove that rod up there and straighten my nose out I could breathe and I have not be able to breathe since I break my nose in the high school rodeo thank you applause
