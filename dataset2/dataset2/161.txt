I want to start my story in Germany in 1877 with a mathematician name Georg Cantor and Cantor decide he be go to take a line and erase the middle third of the line and then take that two result line and bring they back into the same process a recursive process so he start out with one line and then two and then four and then 16 and so on and if he do this a infinite number of time which you can do in mathematics he end up with a infinite number of line each of which have a infinite number of point in it so he realize he have a set whose number of element be large than infinity and this blow he mind literally he check into a sanitarium laughter and when he come out of the sanitarium he be convince that he have be put on earth to find transfinite set theory because the large set of infinity would be God himself he be a very religious man he be a mathematician on a mission and other mathematician do the same sort of thing a Swedish mathematician von Koch decide that instead of subtract line he would add they and so he come up with this beautiful curve and there be no particular reason why we have to start with this seed shape we can use any seed shape we like and I will rearrange this and I will stick this somewhere down there ok and now upon iteration that seed shape sort of unfold into a very different look structure so this all have the property of self similarity the part look like the whole it be the same pattern at many different scale now mathematician think this be very strange because as you shrink a ruler down you measure a long and long length and since they go through the iteration a infinite number of time as the ruler shrink down to infinity the length go to infinity this make no sense at all so they consign this curve to the back of the math book they say this be pathological curve and we do not have to discuss they laughter and that work for a hundred year and then in 1977 Benoit Mandelbrot a French mathematician realize that if you do computer graphic and use this shape he call fractal you get the shape of nature you get the human lung you get acacia tree you get fern you get this beautiful natural form if you take you thumb and you index finger and look right where they meet go ahead and do that now and relax you hand you will see a crinkle and then a wrinkle within the crinkle and a crinkle within the wrinkle right you body be cover with fractal the mathematician who be say this be pathologically useless shape they be breathe that word with fractal lung it be very ironic and I will show you a little natural recursion here again we just take this line and recursively replace they with the whole shape so here be the second iteration and the third fourth and so on so nature have this self similar structure nature use self organize system now in the 1980 I happen to notice that if you look at a aerial photograph of a African village you see fractal and I think this be fabulous I wonder why and of course I have to go to Africa and ask folk why so I get a Fulbright scholarship to just travel around Africa for a year ask person why they be build fractal which be a great job if you can get it laughter and so I finally get to this city and I would do a little fractal model for the city just to see how it would sort of unfold but when I get there I get to the palace of the chief and my French be not very good I say something like I be a mathematician and I would like to stand on you roof but he be really cool about it and he take I up there and we talk about fractal and he say oh yeah yeah we know about a rectangle within a rectangle we know all about that and it turn out the royal insignia have a rectangle within a rectangle within a rectangle and the path through that palace be actually this spiral here and as you go through the path you have to get more and more polite so they be map the social scaling onto the geometric scaling it be a conscious pattern it be not unconscious like a termite mound fractal this be a village in southern Zambia The Ba ila build this village about 400 meter in diameter you have a huge ring the ring that represent the family enclosure get large and large as you go towards the back and then you have the chief ring here towards the back and then the chief immediate family in that ring so here be a little fractal model for it here be one house with the sacred altar here be the house of house the family enclosure with the human here where the sacred altar would be and then here be the village as a whole a ring of ring of ring with the chief extend family here the chief immediate family here and here there be a tiny village only this big now you might wonder how can person fit in a tiny village only this big that be because they be spirit person it be the ancestor and of course the spirit person have a little miniature village in they village right so it be just like Georg Cantor say the recursion continue forever this be in the Mandara mountain near the Nigerian border in Cameroon Mokoulek I see this diagram draw by a French architect and I think wow what a beautiful fractal so I try to come up with a seed shape which upon iteration would unfold into this thing I come up with this structure here let see first iteration second third fourth now after I do the simulation I realize the whole village kind of spiral around just like this and here be that replicate line a self replicate line that unfold into the fractal well I notice that line be about where the only square building in the village be at so when I get to the village I say can you take I to the square building I think something be go on there and they say well we can take you there but you can not go inside because that be the sacred altar where we do sacrifice every year to keep up that annual cycle of fertility for the field and I start to realize that the cycle of fertility be just like the recursive cycle in the geometric algorithm that build this and the recursion in some of this village continue down into very tiny scale so here be a Nankani village in Mali and you can see you go inside the family enclosure you go inside and here be pot in the fireplace stack recursively here be calabash that Issa be just show we and they be stack recursively now the tiny calabash in here keep the woman soul and when she die they have a ceremony where they break this stack call the zalanga and she soul go off to eternity once again infinity be important now you might ask yourself three question at this point be not this scaling pattern just universal to all indigenous architecture and that be actually my original hypothesis when I first see that African fractal I think wow so any indigenous group that do not have a state society that sort of hierarchy must have a kind of bottom up architecture but that turn out not to be true I start collect aerial photograph of native American and South Pacific architecture only the African one be fractal and if you think about it all this different society have different geometric design theme that they use so native American use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry you can see on the pottery and the basket here be a aerial photograph of one of the Anasazi ruin you can see it be circular at the large scale but it be rectangular at the small scale right it be not the same pattern at two different scale second you might ask well Dr Eglash be not you ignore the diversity of African culture and three time the answer be no First of all I agree with Mudimbe wonderful book the invention of Africa that Africa be a artificial invention of first colonialism and then oppositional movement no because a widely share design practice do not necessarily give you a unity of culture and it definitely be not in the dna and finally the fractal have self similarity so they be similar to themselves but they be not necessarily similar to each other you see very different use for fractal it be a share technology in Africa and finally well be not this just intuition it be not really mathematical knowledge African can not possibly really be use fractal geometry right it be not invent until the 1970 well it be true that some African fractal be as far as I be concern just pure intuition so some of this thing I would wander around the street of Dakar ask person what be the algorithm what be the rule for make this and they would say well we just make it that way because it look pretty stupid laughter but sometimes that be not the case in some case there would actually be algorithm and very sophisticated algorithm so in Manghetu sculpture you would see this recursive geometry in Ethiopian cross you see this wonderful unfolding of the shape in Angola the Chokwe person draw line in the sand and it be what the German mathematician Euler call a graph we now call it a eulerian path you can never lift you stylus from the surface and you can never go over the same line twice but they do it recursively and they do it with a age grade system so the little kid learn this one and then the old kid learn this one then the next age grade initiation you learn this one and with each iteration of that algorithm you learn the iteration of the myth you learn the next level of knowledge and finally all over Africa you see this board game it be call Owari in Ghana where I study it it be call Mancala here on the East Coast Bao in Kenya Sogo elsewhere well you see self organizing pattern that spontaneously occur in this board game and the folk in Ghana know about this self organize pattern and would use they strategically so this be very conscious knowledge here be a wonderful fractal Anywhere you go in the Sahel you will see this windscreen and of course fence around the world be all cartesian all strictly linear but here in Africa you have get this nonlinear scaling fence so I track down one of the folk who make this thing this guy in Mali just outside of Bamako and I ask he how come you be make fractal fence because nobody else be and he answer be very interesting he say well if I live in the jungle I would only use the long row of straw because they be very quick and they be very cheap it do not take much time do not take much straw he say but wind and dust go through pretty easily now the tight row up at the very top they really hold out the wind and dust but it take a lot of time and it take a lot of straw because they be really tight now he say we know from experience that the far up from the ground you go the strong the wind blow right it be just like a cost benefit analysis and I measure out the length of straw put it on a log log plot get the scaling exponent and it almost exactly match the scaling exponent for the relationship between wind speed and height in the wind engineering handbook so this guy be right on target for a practical use of scale technology the most complex example of a algorithmic approach to fractal that I find be actually not in geometry it be in a symbolic code and this be Bamana sand divination and the same divination system be find all over Africa you can find it on the East Coast as well as the West Coast and often the symbol be very well preserve so each of this symbol have four bit it be a four bit binary word you draw this line in the sand randomly and then you count off and if it be a odd number you put down one stroke and if it be a even number you put down two stroke and they do this very rapidly and I could not understand where they be get they only do the randomness four time I could not understand where they be get the other 12 symbol and they would not tell I they say no no I can not tell you about this and I say well look I will pay you you can be my teacher and I will come each day and pay you they say it be not a matter of money this be a religious matter and finally out of desperation I say well let I explain Georg Cantor in 1877 and I start explain why I be there in Africa and they get very excited when they see the Cantor set and one of they say come here I think I can help you out here and so he take I through the initiation ritual for a Bamana priest and of course I be only interested in the math so the whole time he keep shake he head go you know I do not learn it this way but I have to sleep with a kola nut next to my bed bury in sand and give seven coin to seven leper and so on and finally he reveal the truth of the matter and it turn out it be a pseudo random number generator use deterministic chaos when you have a four bit symbol you then put it together with another one sideways so even plus odd give you odd Odd plus even give you odd even plus even give you even Odd plus odd give you even it be addition modulo 2 just like in the parity bit check on you computer and then you take this symbol and you put it back in so it be a self generate diversity of symbol they be truly use a kind of deterministic chaos in do this now because it be a binary code you can actually implement this in hardware what a fantastic teaching tool that should be in African engineering school and the most interesting thing I find out about it be historical in the 12th century Hugo of Santalla bring it from Islamic mystic into Spain and there it enter into the alchemy community as geomancy divination through the earth this be a geomantic chart draw for King Richard II in 1390 Leibniz the German mathematician talk about geomancy in he dissertation call De Combinatoria and he say well instead of use one stroke and two stroke let use a one and a zero and we can count by power of two right one and zero the binary code George Boole take Leibniz binary code and create boolean algebra and John von Neumann take Boolean algebra and create the digital computer so all this little pda and laptop every digital circuit in the world start in Africa and I know Brian Eno say there be not enough Africa in computer but you know I do not think there be enough African history in Brian Eno laughter applause so let I end with just a few word about application that we have find for this and you can go to we website the applet be all free they just run in the browser anybody in the world can use they the National Science Foundation broaden participation in Computing program recently award we a grant to make a programmable version of this design tool so hopefully in three year anybody will be able to go on the web and create they own simulation and they own artifact we have focus in the U S on African American student as well as native American and latino we have find statistically significant improvement with child use this software in a mathematics class in comparison with a control group that do not have the software so it be really very successful teaching child that they have a heritage that be about mathematics that it be not just about singing and dancing we have start a pilot program in Ghana we get a small seed grant just to see if folk would be willing to work with we on this we be very excited about the future possibility for that we have also be work in design I do not put he name up here my colleague Kerry in Kenya have come up with this great idea for use fractal structure for postal address in village that have fractal structure because if you try to impose a grid structure postal system on a fractal village it do not quite fit Bernard Tschumi at Columbia University have finish use this in a design for a museum of African art David Hughes at Ohio State University have write a primer on afrocentric architecture in which he be use some of this fractal structure and finally I just want to point out that this idea of self organization as we hear early it be in the brain it be in the it be in Google search engine actually the reason that Google be such a success be because they be the first one to take advantage of the self organize property of the web it be in ecological sustainability it be in the developmental power of entrepreneurship the ethical power of democracy it be also in some bad thing Self organization be why the AIDS virus be spread so fast and if you do not think that capitalism which be self organizing can have destructive effect you have not open you eye enough so we need to think about as be speak early the traditional African method for do self organization this be robust algorithm this be way of do self organization of do entrepreneurship that be gentle that be egalitarian so if we want to find a good way of do that kind of work we need look only no far than Africa to find this robust self organize algorithm thank you
