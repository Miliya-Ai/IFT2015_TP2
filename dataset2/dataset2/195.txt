a great way to start I think with my view of simplicity be to take a look at TED here you be understand why we be here what be go on with no difficulty at all the good a i in the planet would find it complex and confusing and my little dog Watson would find it simple and understandable but would miss the point laughter he would have a great time and of course if you be a speaker here like Hans Rosling a speaker find this complex tricky but in Hans Rosling case he have a secret weapon yesterday literally in he sword swallow act and I must say I think of quite a few object that I might try to swallow today and finally give up on but he just do it and that be a wonderful thing so Puck mean not only be we fool in the pejorative sense but that we be easily fool in fact what Shakespeare be point out be we go to the theater in order to be fool so we be actually look forward to it we go to magic show in order to be fool and this make many thing fun but it make it difficult to actually get any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves and we friend Betty Edwards the draw on the right side of the Brain lady show this two table to she draw class and say the problem you have with learning to draw be not that you can not move you hand but that the way you brain perceive image be faulty it be try to perceive image into object rather than see what be there and to prove it she say the exact size and shape of this tabletop be the same and I be go to prove it to you she do this with cardboard but since I have a expensive computer here I will just rotate this little guy around and now have see that and I have see it hundred of time because I use this in every talk I give I still can not see that they be the same size and shape and I doubt that you can either so what do artist do well what artist do be to measure they measure very very carefully and if you measure very very carefully with a stiff arm and a straight edge you will see that that two shape be exactly the same size and the Talmud see this a long time ago say we see thing not as they be but as we be I certainly would like to know what happen to the person who have that insight back then if they actually follow it to its ultimate conclusion so if the world be not as it seem and we see thing as we be then what we call reality be a kind of hallucination happen inside here it be a wake dream and understanding that that be what we actually exist in be one of the big epistemological barrier in human history and what that mean simple and understandable might not be actually simple or understandable and thing we think be complex might be make simple and understandable somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around we flaw we can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel the way I think of it be we can not learn to see until we admit we be blind once you start down at this very humble level then you can start find way to see thing and what be happen over the last 400 year in particular be that human being have invent brainlet little additional part for we brain make out of powerful idea that help we see the world in different way and this be in the form of sensory apparatus telescope microscope reasoning apparatus various way of thinking and most importantly in the ability to change perspective on thing I will talk about that a little bit it be this change in perspective on what it be we think we be perceive that have help we make more progress in the last 400 year than we have in the rest of human history and yet it be not teach in any k through 12 curriculum in America that I be aware of so one of the thing that go from simple to complex be when we do more we like more if we do more in a kind of a stupid way the simplicity get complex and in fact we can keep on do it for a very long time but Murray Gell Mann yesterday talk about emergent property another name for they could be architecture as a metaphor for take the same old material and think about non obvious non simple way of combine it and in fact what Murray be talk about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature of have the description at various level be rather similar all go down to the idea that the elementary particle be both sticky and standoffish and they be in violent motion that three thing give rise to all the different level of what seem to be complexity in we world but how simple so when I see Roslings Gapminder stuff a few year ago I just think it be the great thing I have see in convey complex idea simply but then I have a thought of boy maybe it be too simple and I put some effort in to try and check to see how well this simple portrayal of trend over time actually match up with some idea and investigation from the side and I find that they match up very well so the Roslings have be able to do simplicity without remove what be important about the datum whereas the film yesterday that we see of the simulation of the inside of a cell as a former molecular biologist I do not like that at all not because it be not beautiful or anything but because it miss the thing that most student fail to understand about molecular biology and that be why be there any probability at all of two complex shape find each other just the right way so they combine together and be catalyze and what we see yesterday be every reaction be fortuitous they just swoop in the air and bind and something happen but in fact that molecule be spin at the rate of about a million revolution per second they be agitate back and forth they size every two nanosecond they be completely crowd together they be jam they be bash up against each other and if you do not understand that in you mental model of this stuff what happen inside of a cell seem completely mysterious and fortuitous and I think that be exactly the wrong image for when you be try to teach science so another thing that we do be to confuse adult sophistication with the actual understanding of some principle so a kid who be 14 in high school get this version of the pythagorean theorem which be a truly subtle and interesting proof but in fact it be not a good way to start learn about mathematics so a more direct one one that give you more of the feeling of math be something close to Pythagoras own proof which go like this so here we have this triangle and if we surround that C square with three more triangle and we copy that notice that we can move that triangle down like this and that leave two open area that be kind of suspicious and bingo that be all you have to do and this kind of proof be the kind of proof that you need to learn when you be learn mathematics in order to get a idea of what it mean before you look into the literally 1 200 or 1 500 proof of Pythagoras theorem that have be discover now let go to young child this be a very unusual teacher who be a kindergarten and first grade teacher but be a natural mathematician so she be like that jazz musician friend you have who never study music but be a terrific musician she just have a feeling for math and here be she six year old and she be get they make shape out of a shape so they pick a shape they like like a diamond or a square or a triangle or a trapezoid and then they try and make the next large shape of that same shape and the next large shape you can see the trapezoid be a little challenging there and what this teacher do on every project be to have the child act like first it be a creative art project and then something like science so they have create this artifact now she have they look at they and do this laborious which I think for a long time until she explain to I be to slow they down so they will think so they be cut out the little piece of cardboard here and paste they up but the whole point of this thing be for they to look at this chart and fill it out what have you notice about what you do and so six year old Lauren there notice that the first one take one and the second one take three more and the total be four on that one the third one take five more and the total be nine on that one and then the next one she see right away that the additional tile that you have to add around the edge be always go to grow by two so she be very confident about how she make that number there and she could see that this be the square number up until about six where she be not sure what six time six be and what seven time seven be but then she be confident again so that be what Lauren do and then the teacher Gillian Ishijima have the kid bring all of they project up to the front of the room and put they on the floor and everybody go batshit holy shit they be the same no matter what the shape be the growth law be the same and the mathematician and scientist in the crowd will recognize this two progression as a first order discrete differential equation and a second order discrete differential equation derive by six year old well that be pretty amazing that be not what we usually try to teach six year old so let take a look now at how we might use the computer for some of this and so the first idea here be just to show you the kind of thing that child do I be use the software that we be put on the 100 laptop so I would like to draw a little car here I will just do this very quickly and put a big tire on he and I get a little object here and I can look inside this object I will call it a car and here be a little behavior car forward each time I click it car turn if I want to make a little script to do this over and over again I just drag this guy out and set they go and I can try steer the car here by see the car turn by five here so what if I click this down to zero it go straight that be a big revelation for nine year old make it go in the other direction but of course that be a little bit like kiss you sister as far as drive a car so the kid want to do a steering wheel so they draw a steering wheel and we will call this a wheel see this wheel head here if I turn this wheel you can see that number over there go minus and positive that be kind of a invitation to pick up this name of that number come out there and to just drop it into the script here and now I can steer the car with the steering wheel and it be interesting you know how much trouble the child have with variable but by learn it this way in a situate fashion they never forget from this single trial what a variable be and how to use it and we can reflect here the way Gillian Ishijima do so if you look at the little script here the speed be always go to be 30 we be go to move the car accord to that over and over again and I be drop a little dot for each one of this thing they be evenly space because they be 30 apart and what if I do this progression that the six year old do of say ok I be go to increase the speed by two each time and then I be go to increase the distance by the speed each time what do I get there we get a visual pattern of what this nine year old call acceleration so how do the child do science video teacher choose object that you think will fall to the Earth at the same time student 1 ooh this be nice teacher do not pay any attention to what anybody else be do who be get the apple Alan Kay they have get little stopwatch student 2 what do you get what do you get AK Stopwatches be not accurate enough student 3 0 99 second teacher so put sponge ball student 4l I decide to do the shot put and the sponge ball because they be two totally different weight and if you drop they at the same time maybe they will drop at the same speed teacher Drop Class whoa AK so obviously Aristotle never ask a child about this particular point because of course he do not bother do the experiment and neither do St Thomas Aquinas and it be not until Galileo actually do it that a adult thought like a child only 400 year ago we get one child like that about every classroom of 30 kid who will actually cut straight to the chase now what if we want to look at this more closely we can take a movie of what be go on but even if we single step this movie it be tricky to see what be go on and so what we can do be we can lay out the frame side by side or stack they up so when the child see this they say ah acceleration remember back four month when they do they car sideways and they start measure to find out what kind of acceleration it be so what I be do be measure from the bottom of one image to the bottom of the next image about a fifth of a second later like that and they be get fast and fast each time and if I stack this guy up then we see the difference the increase in the speed be constant and they say oh yeah constant acceleration we have do that already and how shall we look and verify that we actually have it so you can not tell much from just make the ball drop there but if we drop the ball and run the movie at the same time we can see that we have come up with a accurate physical model Galileo by the way do this very cleverly by run a ball backwards down the string of he lute I pull out that apple to remind myself to tell you that this be actually probably a Newton and the apple type story but it be a great story and I think I would do just one thing on the 100 laptop here just to prove that this stuff work here so once you have gravity here be this increase the speed by something increase the ship speed if I start the little game here that the kid have do it will crash the space ship but if I oppose gravity here we go oops laughter one more yeah there we go yeah ok I guess the good way to end this be with two quote Marshall McLuhan say child be the message that we send to the future but in fact if you think of it child be the future we send to the future forget about message child be the future and child in the first and second world and most especially in the third world need mentor and this summer we be go to build five million of this 100 laptop and maybe 50 million next year but we could not create 1 000 new teacher this summer to save we life that mean that we once again have a thing where we can put technology out but the mentoring that be require to go from a simple new iChat instant messaging system to something with depth be miss I believe this have to be do with a new kind of user interface and this new kind of user interface could be do with a expenditure of about 100 million dollar it sound like a lot but it be literally 18 minute of what we be spend in Iraq we be spend 8 billion dollar a month 18 minute be 100 million dollar so this be actually cheap and Einstein say thing should be as simple as possible but not simple thank you
