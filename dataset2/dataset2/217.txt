this be the large Hadron Collider it be 27 kilometer in circumference it be the big scientific experiment ever attempt over 10 000 physicist and engineer from 85 country around the world have come together over several decade to build this machine what we do be we accelerate proton so hydrogen nucleus around 99 999999 percent the speed of light right at that speed they go around that 27 kilometer 11 000 time a second and we collide they with another beam of proton go in the opposite direction we collide they inside giant detector they be essentially digital camera and this be the one that I work on ATLAS you get some sense of the size you can just see this EU standard size person underneath laughter you get some sense of the size 44 meter wide 22 meter in diameter 7 000 ton and we be create the condition that be present less than a billionth of a second after the universe begin up to 600 million time a second inside that detector immense number and if you see that metal bit there that be huge magnet that bend electrically charge particle so it can measure how fast they be travel this be a picture about a year ago that magnet be in there and again a EU standard size real person so you get some sense of the scale and it be in there that that mini big Bangs will be create sometime in the summer this year and actually this morning I get a email say that we have just finish today build the last piece of ATLAS so as of today it be finish I would like to say that I plan that for TED but I do not so it be be complete as of today applause yeah it be a wonderful achievement so you might be ask why why create the condition that be present less than a billionth of a second after the universe begin well particle physicist be nothing if not ambitious and the aim of particle physics be to understand what everything make of and how everything stick together and by everything I mean of course I and you the Earth the Sun the 100 billion sun in we galaxy and the 100 billion galaxy in the observable universe absolutely everything now you might say well ok but why not just look at it you know if you want to know what I be make of let look at I well we find that as you look back in time the universe get hot and hot dense and dense and simple and simple now there be no real reason I be aware of for that but that seem to be the case so way back in the early time of the universe we believe it be very simple and understandable all this complexity all the way to this wonderful thing human brain be a property of a old and cold and complicated universe back at the start in the first billionth of a second we believe or we have observe it be very simple it be almost like imagine a snowflake in you hand and you look at it and it be a incredibly complicate beautiful object but as you heat it up it will melt into a pool of water and you would be able to see that actually it be just make of h20 water so it be in that same sense that we look back in time to understand what the universe be make of and as of today it be make of this thing just 12 particle of matter stick together by four force of nature the quark this pink thing be the thing that make up proton and neutron that make up the atomic nucleus in you body the electron the thing that go around the atomic nucleus hold around in orbit by the way by the electromagnetic force that be carry by this thing the photon the quark be stick together by other thing call gluon and this guy here they be the weak nuclear force probably the least familiar but without it the sun would not shine and when the sun shine you get copious quantity of this thing call neutrino pour out actually if you just look at you thumbnail about a square centimeter there be something like 60 billion neutrino per second from the sun pass through every square centimeter of you body but you do not feel they because the weak force be correctly name very short range and very weak so they just fly through you and this particle have be discover over the last century pretty much the first one the electron be discover in 1897 and the last one this thing call the tau neutrino in the year 2000 actually just I be go to say just up the road in Chicago I know it be a big country America be not it just up the road relative to the universe it be just up the road laughter so this thing be discover in the year 2000 so it be a relatively recent picture one of the wonderful thing actually I find be that we have discover any of they when you realize how tiny they be you know they be a step in size from the entire observable universe so 100 billion galaxy 13 7 billion light year away a step in size from that to Monterey actually be about the same as from Monterey to this thing absolutely exquisitely minute and yet we have discover pretty much the full set so one of my most illustrious forebear at Manchester University Ernest Rutherford discoverer of the atomic nucleus once say all science be either physics or stamp collect now I do not think he mean to insult the rest of science although he be from New Zealand so it be possible laughter but what he mean be that what we have do really be stamp collect there ok we have discover the particle but unless you understand the underlying reason for that pattern you know why it be build the way it be really you have do stamp collect you have not do science fortunately we have probably one of the great scientific achievement of the twentieth century that underpin that pattern it be the Newton law if you want of particle physics it be call the standard model beautifully simple mathematical equation you could stick it on the front of a t shirt which be always the sign of elegance this be it laughter I have be a little disingenuous because I have expand it out in all its gory detail this equation though allow you to calculate everything other than gravity that happen in the universe so you want to know why the sky be blue why atomic nucleus stick together in principle you have get a big enough computer why dna be the shape it be in principle you should be able to calculate it from that equation but there be a problem can anyone see what it be a bottle of champagne for anyone that tell I I will make it easy actually by blow one of the line up basically each of this term refer to some of the particle so that w there refer to the Ws and how they stick together this carrier of the weak force the Zs the same but there be a extra symbol in this equation h right h h stand for Higgs particle Higgs particle have not be discover but they be necessary they be necessary to make that mathematics work so all the exquisitely detailed calculation we can do with that wonderful equation would not be possible without a extra bit so it be a prediction a prediction of a new particle what do it do well we have a long time to come up with good analogy and back in the 1980 when we want the money for the LHC from the U K government Margaret Thatcher at the time say if you guy can explain in language a politician can understand what the hell it be that you be do you can have the money I want to know what this Higgs particle do and we come up with this analogy and it seem to work well what the Higgs do be it give mass to the fundamental particle and the picture be that the whole universe and that do not mean just space it mean I as well and inside you the whole universe be full of something call a Higgs field Higgs particle if you will the analogy be that this person in a room be the Higgs particle now when a particle move through the universe it can interact with this Higgs particle but imagine someone who be not very popular move through the room then everyone ignore they they can just pass through the room very quickly essentially at the speed of light they be massless and imagine someone incredibly important and popular and intelligent walk into the room they be surround by person and they passage through the room be impede it be almost like they get heavy they get massive and that be exactly the way the Higgs mechanism work the picture be that the electron and the quark in you body and in the universe that we see around we be heavy in a sense and massive because they be surround by Higgs particle they be interact with the Higgs field if that picture true then we have to discover that Higgs particle at the LHC if it be not true because it be quite a convoluted mechanism although it be the simple we have be able to think of then whatever do the job of the Higgs particle we know have to turn up at the LHC so that be one of the prime reason we build this giant machine I be glad you recognize Margaret Thatcher actually I think about make it more culturally relevant but laughter anyway so that be one thing that be essentially a guarantee of what the LHC will find there be many other thing you have hear many of the big problem in particle physics one of they you hear about dark matter dark energy there be another issue which be that the force in nature it be quite beautiful actually seem as you go back in time they seem to change in strength well they do change in strength so the electromagnetic force the force that hold we together get strong as you go to high temperature the strong force the strong nuclear force which stick nucleus together get weak and what you see be the standard model you can calculate how this change be the force the three force other than gravity almost seem to come together at one point it be almost as if there be one beautiful kind of super force back at the beginning of time but they just miss now there be a theory call super symmetry which double the number of particle in the standard model which at first sight do not sound like a simplification but actually with this theory we find that the force of nature do seem to unify together back at the Big Bang absolutely beautiful prophecy the model be not build to do that but it seem to do it also that super symmetric particle be very strong candidate for the dark matter so a very compelling theory that be really mainstream physics and if I be to put money on it I would put money on in a very unscientific way that that this thing would also crop up at the LHC many other thing that the LHC could discover but in the last few minute I just want to give you a different perspective of what I think what particle physics really mean to I particle physics and cosmology and that be that I think it be give we a wonderful narrative almost a creation story if you would like about the universe from modern science over the last few decade and I would say that it deserve in the spirit of Wade Davis talk to be at least put up there with this wonderful creation story of the person of the high Andes and the frozen north this be a creation story I think equally as wonderful the story go like this we know that the universe begin 13 7 billion year ago in a immensely hot dense state much small than a single atom it begin to expand about a million billion billion billion billionth of a second I think I get that right after the Big Bang gravity separate away from the other force the universe then undergo a exponential expansion call inflation in about the first billionth of a second or so the Higgs field kick in and the quark and the gluon and the electron that make we up get mass the universe continue to expand and cool after about a few minute there be hydrogen and helium in the universe that be all the universe be about 75 percent hydrogen 25 percent helium it still be today it continue to expand about 300 million year then light begin to travel through the universe it be big enough to be transparent to light and that be what we see in the cosmic microwave background that George Smoot describe as look at the face of God after about 400 million year the first star form and that hydrogen that helium then begin to cook into the heavy element so the element of life carbon and oxygen and iron all the element that we need to make we up be cook in that first generation of star which then run out of fuel explode throw that element back into the universe they then be collapse into another generation of star and planet and on some of that planet the oxygen which have be create in that first generation of star could fuse with hydrogen to form water liquid water on the surface on at least one and maybe only one of that planet primitive life evolve which evolve over million of year into thing that walk upright and leave footprint about three and a half million year ago in the mud flat of Tanzania and eventually leave a footprint on another world and build this civilization this wonderful picture that turn the darkness into light and you can see the civilization from space as one of my great hero Carl Sagan say this be the thing and actually not only this but I be look around this be the thing like Saturn V rocket and Sputnik and DNA and literature and science this be the thing that hydrogen atom do when give 13 7 billion year absolutely remarkable and the law of physics right so the right law of physics they be beautifully balance if the weak force have be a little bit different then carbon and oxygen would not be stable inside the heart of star and there would be none of that in the universe and I think that be a wonderful and significant story 50 year ago I could not have tell that story because we do not know it it make I really feel that that civilization which as I say if you believe the scientific creation story have emerge purely as a result of the law of physics and a few hydrogen atom then I think to I anyway it make I feel incredibly valuable so that be the LHC the LHC be certainly when it turn on in summer go to write the next chapter of that book and I be certainly look forward with immense excitement to it be turn on thanks applause
