every presentation need this slide in it laughter it be beautiful be not it do you see all the point all the line it be incredible it be the network and in my case the network have be important in media because I get to connect to person be not it amazing through that I connect to person and the way that I have be do it have be multifaceted for example I get person to dress up they vacuum clean laughter I put together project like Earth Sandwich where I ask person to try and simultaneously place two piece of bread perfectly opposite each other on the Earth and person start lay bread in tribute and eventually a team be able to do it between New Zealand and Spain it be pretty incredible the video online connect to person in project like YoungmeNowme for example in YoungmeNowme the audience be ask to find a childhood photograph of themselves and restage it as a adult laughter this be the same person top photo James bottom photo Jennifer Poignant this be a mother day gift laughter particularly creepy applause laughter my favorite of this photo which I could not find be there be a picture of a 30 year old woman or so with a little baby on she lap and the next photo be a 220 lb man with a tiny little old lady peak over he shoulder but this project change the way that I think about connect to person this be project call Ray and what happen be I be send this piece of audio and have no idea who generate the audio somebody say you have to listen to this and this be what come to I Recording hi my name be Ray and on yesterday my daughter call I because she be stress out because of thing that be go on on she job that she feel be quite unfair be quite disturbed she call for comfort and I do not really know what to tell she because we have to deal with so much mess in we society so I be lead to write this song just for she just to give she some encouragement while deal with stress and pressure on she job and I figure I would put it on the internet for all employee under stress to help you good deal with what you be go through on you job here be how the song go I be about to whip somebody ass oh I be about to whip somebody ass oh if you do not leave I alone you go to have to send I home cause I be about to whip somebody ass now you might not be able to sing that out loud but you can hum it to yourself and you know what the word be and let it give you some strength to get the next few moment on you job all right stay strong peace Ze Frank so yeah no no no shush we have get to go quickly so I be so move by this this be incredible this be connect right this be at a distance realize that someone be feel something want to affect they in a particular way use media to do it put it online and realize that there be a great impact this be incredible this be what I want to do so the first thing I think of be we have to thank he and I ask my audience I say listen to this piece of audio we have to remix it he be get a great voice it be actually in the key of B flat and have to do something with it hundred of remix come back lot of different attempt one stand out in particular it be do by a guy name Goose Remix I be about to whip somebody ass oh I be about to whip somebody ass oh if you do not leave I alone you gon to have to send I home cuz I be about to whip somebody ass I be about to whip some ZF Great so it be incredible that song applause thank you so that song somebody tell I that it be at a baseball game in Kansas City in the end it be one of the top download on a whole bunch of music streaming service and so I say let put this together in a album and the audience come together and they design a album cover and I say if you put it all on this I be go to deliver it to he if you can figure out who this person be because all I have be he name Ray and this little piece of audio and the fact that he daughter be upset in two week they find he I receive and email and it say hi I be Ray I hear you be look for I laughter and I be like yeah Ray it be be a interesting two week and so I fly to St Louis and meet Ray and he be a preacher laughter among other thing so but anyways here be the thing be it remind I of this which be a sign that you see in Amsterdam on every street corner and it be sort of a metaphor for I for the virtual world I look at this photo and he seem really interested in what be go on with that button but it do not seem like he be really that interested in cross the street laughter and it make I think of this on street corner everywhere person be look at they cell phone and it be easy to dismiss this as some sort of bad trend in human culture but the truth be life be be live there when they smile right you have see person stop all of a sudden life be be live there somewhere up in that weird dense network and this be it right to feel and be feel it be the fundamental force that we be all after we can build all sort of environment to make it a little bit easy but ultimately what we be try to do be really connect with one other person and that be not always go to happen in physical space it be also go to now happen in virtual space and we have to get good at figure that out I think of the person that build all this technology in the network a lot of they be not very good at connect with person this be kind of like something I use to do in third grade laughter so here be a series of project over the last few year where I have be inspire by try to figure out how to really facilitate close connection sometimes they be very very simple thing a Childhood Walk which be a project where I ask person to remember a walk that they use to take as a child over and over again that be sort of meaningless like on the route to the bus stop to a neighbor house and take it inside of Google Streetview and I promise you if you take that walk inside Google Streetview you come to a moment where something come back and hit you in the face and I collect that moment the photo inside Google Streetview and the memory specifically we conversation start with I say I be bored and she reply when I be bored I eat pretzel I remember this distinctly because it come up a lot right after he tell I and my brother he be go to be separate from my mom I remember walk to a convenience store and get a cherry cola they use some of the morbidly artist footage a close up of Chad shoe in the middle of the highway I guess the shoe come off when he be hit he sleep over at my house once and he leave he pillow it have Chad write in magic marker on it he die long after he leave the pillow at my house but we never get around to return it sometimes they be a little bit more abstract this be Pain Pack Right after September 11th last year I be think about pain and the way that we disperse it the way that we excise it from we body so what I do be I open up a hotline a hotline where person could leave voicemail of they pain not necessarily relate to that event and person call in and leave message like this Recording okay here be something I be not alone and I be love I be really fortunate but sometimes I feel really lonely and when I feel that way even the small act of kindness can make I cry like even person in convenience store say have a nice day when they be accidentally look I in the eye ZF so what I do be I take that voicemail and with they permission convert they to mp3 and distribute they to sound editor who create short sound use just that voicemail and that be then distribute to dj who have make hundred of song use that source material music we do not have time to play much of it you can look at it online from 52 to 48 with love be a project around the time of the last election cycle where McCain and Obama both in they speech after the election talk about reconciliation and I be like what the hell do that look like so I think well let just give it a try let have person hold up sign about reconciliation and so some really nice thing come together I vote blue I vote red together for we future this be very very cute little thing right some come from the win party dear 48 I promise to listen to you to fight for you to respect you always some come from the party who have just lose from a 48 to a 52 may you party leadership be as classy as you but I doubt it but the truth be that as this start become popular a couple rightw blog and some message board apparently find it to be a little patronizing which I could also see and so I start get amazing amount of hate mail death threat even and one guy in particular keep on write I this pretty awful message and he be dress as Batman and he say I be dress as Batman to hide my identity just in case I think the real Batman be come after I which actually make I feel a little well like Phew it be not he so what I do unfortunately I be harbor all this kind of awful experience and this pain inside of I and it start to eat away at my psyche and I be protect the project from it I realize I be protect it I do not want this special little group of photograph to get sully in some way so what I do I take all that email and I put they together into something call Angrigami which be a origami template make out of this sort of vile stuff and I ask person to send I beautiful thing make out of the Angrigami laughter but this be the emotional moment one of my viewer uncle die on a particular day and he choose to commemorate it with a piece of hate it be amazing the last thing I be go to tell you about be a series of project call song you already know where the idea be I be try to figure out to address particular kind of emotion with group project so one of they be fairly straightforward a guy say that he daughter get scare at night and could I write a song for she he daughter and I say oh yeah I will try to write a mantra that she can sing to herself to help herself go to sleep and this be scared video this be a song that I sing when I be scare of something I do not know why but it help I get over it the word of the song just move I along and somehow I get over it at least I do not suck at life I keep on try despite at least I do not suck at life I keep on try despite this be a song that I sing when I be scare of something okay so I write that song right thank you so the nice thing be be he walk by he daughter room at some point and she actually be sing that song to herself so I be like awesome this be great and then I get this email and there be a little bit of a back story to this and I do not have much time but the idea be that at one point I do a project call Facebook I equal you where I want to experience what it be like to live as another person so I ask for person username and password to be send to I and I get a lot like 30 in a half a hour and I shut that part down and I choose two person to be and I ask they to send I description of how to act as they on Facebook one person send I a very detailed description the other person do not and the person who do not it turn out have just move to a new city and take on a new job so you know person be write I and say how you new job I be like I do not know do not know I have one but anyway this same person Laura end up email I a little bit after that project and I feel badly for not have do a good job and she say I be really anxious I just move to a new town I have this new job and I have just have this incredible amount of anxiety so she have see the scared song and wonder if I could do something so I ask she what do it feel like when you feel this way and she write a sort of descriptive set of what it feel like to have have this anxiety and so what I decide to do I say okay I will think about it and so quietly in the background I start send person this Audio hey you be okay you will be fine so I ask person whether they have basic audio capability just so they could sing along to the song with headphone on so I could just get they voice back and this be the kind of thing that I get back Recording hey you be okay you will be fine ZF so that be one of the good one really but what be awesome be as I start get more and more and more of they all of a sudden I have 30 40 voice from around the world and when you put they together something magical happen something absolutely incredible happen and all of a sudden I get a chorus from around the world and what be really great be I be put all this work together in the background and Laura send I a follow up email because a good month have pass by and she say I know you have forget about I I just want to say thanks for even consider it and then a few day later I send she this Audio Right now it feel like I forget to turn the light on and thing that look so good yesterday be now shades of gray and it seem like the world be spin while I be stand still or maybe I be spin I can not tell and then you say hey you be okay you will be fine just breathe and now the word sing hey you be okay you will be fine just breathe now everybody sing hey you be okay you will be fine just breathe hey you be okay you will be fine just breathe hey you be okay you will be fine just breathe thank you applause
