Zach Kaplan Keith and I lead a research team we investigate material and technology that have unexpected property over the last three year we find over 200 of this thing and so we look back into we library and select six we think would be most surprising for TED of this six the first one that we be go to talk about be in the black envelope you be hold it come from a company in Japan call GelTech now go ahead and open it up Keith Schacht now be sure and take the two piece apart what be unexpected about this be that it be soft but it be also a strong magnet Zach and I have always be fascinate observe unexpected thing like this we spend a long time think about why this be and it be just recently that we realize it be when we see something unexpected it change we understanding of the way thing work as you be see this gel magnet for the first time if you assume that all magnet have to be hard then see this surprise you and it change you understanding of the way magnet could work ZK now it be important to understand what the unexpected property be but to really think about the implication of what this make possible we find that it help to think about how it could be apply in the world so a first idea be to use it on cabinet door if you line the side of the cabinet use the gel material if a cabinet slam shut it would not make a loud noise and in addition the magnet would draw the cabinet close imagine take the same material but put it on the bottom of a sneaker you know this way you could go to the container store and buy one of that metal sheet that they hang on the back of you door in you closet and you could literally stick you shoe up instead of use a shelf for I I really love this idea laughter if you come to my apartment and see my closet I be sure you would figure out why it be a mess KS see the unexpected property and then see a couple of application it help you see why this be significant what the potential be but we have find that the way we present we idea it make a big difference ZK it be like six month ago that Keith and I be out in l a and we be at Starbucks have coffee with Roman Coppola He work on mostly music video and commercial with he company the Directors Bureau as we be talk Roman tell we that he be kind of a inventor on the side and we be show he the same gel magnet that you be hold in you hand and you know we share the same idea and you could see it in he face Roman start to get really excited and he whip out this manila folder he open it up and Keith and I look in and he start show we concept that he be be work on this thing just get he really excited and so we be look at this concept and we be just like whoa this guy good because the way that he present the concept he approach be totally different than ours he sell it to you as if it be for sale right now when we be go in the car back to the airport we be think why be this so powerful and as we think about it more we realize that it let you fill in all the detail about the experience just as if you see it on tv so for TED we decide to take we favorite idea for the gel magnet and work with Roman and he team at the Directors Bureau to create a commercial for a product from the future Narrator do you have a need for speed Inventables Water Adventures dare you to launch yourself on a magnetically levitate board down a waterslide so fast so tall that when you hit the bottom it use brake to stop Aqua Rocket come this summer ks now we show the concept to a few person before this and they ask we when it come out so I just want to let you know it be not actually come out just the concept be ZK so now when we dream up this concept it be important for we to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint so I just want to quickly explain how this would work this be the magnetically levitate board that they mention in the commercial the gel that you be hold would be line the bottom of the board now this be important for two reason one the soft property of the magnet that make it so that if it be to hit the rider in the head it would not injure he in addition you can see from the diagram on the right the underpart of the slide would be a electromagnet so this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you be go down the force of the water rush down in addition to that repulsion force would make this slide go fast than any slide on the market it be because of this that you need the magnetic braking system when you get to the very bottom of the slide laughter the rider pass through a aluminum tube and I be go to kick it to Keith to explain why that be important from a technical standpoint KS so I be sure all you engineer know that even though aluminum be a metal it be not a magnetic material but something unexpected happen when you drop a magnet down a aluminum tube so we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you laughter now you see the magnet fall really slowly now I be not go to get into the physics of it but all you need to know be that the fast the magnet fall the great the stop force ZK now we next technology be actually a 10 foot pole and I have it right here in my pocket laughter there be a few different version of it laughter KS some of they automatically unroll like this one they can be make to automatically roll up or they can be make stable like Zach to hold any position in between ZK as we be talk to the vendor to try to learn about how you could apply this or how they be be apply currently he be tell we that in the military they use this one so soldier can keep it on they chest very conceal and then when they be out on the field erect it as a antenna to clearly send signal back to the base in we brainstorm we come up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal so at the end of the game you just roll up the goal and put it in you gym bag laughter ks now the interesting thing about this be you do not have to be a engineer to appreciate why a 10 foot pole that can fit in you pocket be so interesting laughter so we decide to go out onto the street of Chicago and ask a few person on the street what they think you could do with this man I clean my ceiling fan with that and I get the spider web off my house I do it that way woman I would make my very own walk stick woman I would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree woman a olive server man some type of extension pole like what the painter use woman I would make a spear that when you go deep sea diving you could catch the fish really fast and then roll it back up and you could swim easy yeah laughter zk now for we next technology we be go to do a little demonstration and so we need a volunteer from the audience you sir come on up laughter come on up tell everybody you name Steve Jurvetson Steve ZK it be Steve All right Steve now follow I we need you to stand right in front of the TED sign right there that be great and hold onto this good luck to you laughter KS No not yet laughter zk I would just like to let you all know that this presentation have be bring to you by target ks little bit that be perfect just perfect now Zach we be go to demonstrate a water gun fight from the future laughter so here come on up to the front all right so now if you will see here no no it be ok so describe to the audience the temperature of you shirt go ahead sj it be cold ks now the reason it be cold be that be it be not actually water load into this squirt gun it be a dry liquid develop by 3M it be perfectly clear it be odorless it be colorless it be so safe you could drink this stuff laughter and the reason it feel cold be because it evaporate 25 time fast than water laughter all right well thanks for come up laughter ZK wait wait Steven before you go we fill this with the dry liquid so during the break you can shoot you friend sj excellent thank you KS thanks for come up let give he a big round of applause applause so what be the significance of this dry liquid early version of the fluid be actually use on a Cray Supercomputer now the unexpected thing about this be that Zach could stand up on stage and drench a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern that we have damage the electronics that we have get he wet that we have hurt the book or the computer it work because it be non conductive so you can see here you can immerse a whole circuit board in this and it would not cause any damage you can circulate it to draw the heat away but today it be most widely use in office building in the sprinkler system as a fire suppression fluid again it be perfectly safe for person it put out the fire do not hurt anything but we favorite idea for this be use it in a basketball game so during halftime it could rain down on the player cool everyone down and in a matter of minute it would dry would not hurt the court ZK we next technology come to we from a company in Japan call Sekisui Chemical one of they r d engineer be work on a way to make plastic stiff while he be do this he notice a unexpected thing we have a video to show you KS so you see there it do not bounce back now this be a unintended side effect of some experiment they be do it be technically call shape retain property now think about you interaction with aluminum foil shape retain be common in metal you bend a piece of aluminum foil and it hold its place contrast that with a plastic garbage can and you can push in the side and it always bounce back ZK for example you could make a watch that wrap around you wrist but do not use a buckle take it a little further if you weave that strip together kind of like a little basket you could make a shape retain sheet and then you could embed it in a cloth so you could make a picnic sheet that wrap around the table so that way on a windy day it would not blow away for we next technology it be hard to observe the unexpected property by itself because it be a ink so we have prepare a video to show it apply to paper ks as this paper be bend the resistance of the ink change so with simple electronics you can detect how much the page be be bent now to think about the potential for this think of all the place ink be supply on business card on the back of cereal box board game any place you use ink you could change the way you interact with it ZK so my favorite idea for this be to apply the ink to a book this could totally change the way that you interface with paper you see the dark line on the side and the top as you turn the page of the book the book can actually detect what page you be on base on the curvature of the page in addition if you be to fold in one of the corner then you could program the book to actually email you the text on the page for you note KS for we last technology we work again with Roman and he team at the Directors Bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it work old milk carton oh yeah it smell good who be you new milk carton I be new milk omc I use to smell like you Narrator Fresh Watch from Inventables dairy farm package that change color when you milk go off do not let milk spoil you morning ZK now this technology be develop by this two guy Professor Ken Suslick and Neil Rakow of the University of Illinois KS now the way it work there be a matrix of color dye and this dye change color in response to odor so the smell of vanilla that might change the four on the leave to brown and the one on the right to yellow this matrix can produce thousand of different color combination to represent thousand of different smell but like in the milk commercial if you know what odor you want to detect then they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor ZK Right it be that that start a conversation with Professor Suslick and myself and he be explain to I the thing that this be make possible beyond just detect spoiled food it be really where the significance of it lie he company actually do a survey of fireman all across the country to try to learn how be they currently test the air when they respond to a emergency scene and he kind of comically explain that time after time what the fireman would say be they would rush to the scene of the crime they would look around if there be no dead policeman it be ok to go laughter I mean this be a true story they be use policeman as canary laughter but more seriously they determine that you could develop a device that can smell good than the human and say if it be safe for the fireman in addition he be spin off a company from the University call ChemSensing where they be work on medical equipment so a patient can come in and actually blow into they device by detect the odor of particular bacterium or virus or even lung cancer the dot will change and they can use software to analyze the result this can radically improve the way that doctor diagnose patient currently they be use a method of trial and error but this could tell you precisely what disease you have KS so that be the six we have for you today but I hope you be start to see why we find this thing so fascinating because every one of this six change we understanding of what be possible in the world prior to see this we would have assume a 10 foot pole could not fit in you pocket something as inexpensive as ink could not sense the way paper be be bent every one of this thing and we be constantly try to find more ZK this be something that Keith and I really enjoy do I be sure it be obvious to you now but it be actually yesterday that I be remind of why I be have a conversation with Steve Jurvetson over downstairs by the escalator and he be tell I that when Chris send out that little box one of the item in it be the hydrophobic sand the sand that do not get wet he say that he be play with it with he son and you know he son be mesmerize because he would dunk it in the water he would take it out and it be bone dry a few week late he say that he son be play with a lock of he mother hair and he notice that there be some drop of water on the hair and he take the thing and he look up to Steve and he say look hydrophobic string laughter I mean after hear that story that really sum it up for I thank you very much KS thank you applause
