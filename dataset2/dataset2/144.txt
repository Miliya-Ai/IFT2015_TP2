I be know good for human powered flight but that be just one thing that get I go in the sort of thing that I be work in now as a youngster I be very interested in model airplane ornithopter autogyro helicopter glider power plane indoor model outdoor model everything which I just think be a lot of fun and wonder why most other person do not share my same enthusiasm with they and then navy pilot training and after college I get into sailplane fly power plane fly and consider the sailplane as a sort of hobby and fun but get tangle up with some great professor type who convince I and everybody else in the field that this be a good way to get into really deep science while this be all go on I be in the field of weather modification although get a ph d in aeronautics the weather modification subject be get start and as a graduate student I could go around to the various talk that be be give on a hitchhiker ride to the East Coast and so on and everybody would talk to I but all the professional in the field hate each other and they would not communicate and as a result I get the absolutely unique background in that field and start a company which do more research in weather modification than anybody and there be a lot of thing that I just can not go into but then 1971 start AeroVironment with no employee then one or two three and sort of fumble along on try to get interesting project we have AirDynamisis who like I do not want to work for aerospace company on some big many year project and so we do we small project and the company slowly grow the thing that be exciting be in 1976 I suddenly get interested in the human powered airplane because I would make a make a loan to a friend of 100 000 dollar or I guarantee the money at the bank he need they he need the money for start a company the company do not succeed and he could not pay the money back and I be the guarantor of the note so I have a 100 000 debt and I notice that the Kramer prize for human powered flight which have then be around for laughter 17 year at the time be 50 000 pound which at the exchange rate be just about 100 000 dollar so suddenly I be interested in human powered flight laughter and do not the way I approach it first think about way to make the plane be just like they have be do in England and not succeed and I give it up I figure nah there be not any simple easy way but then get off on a vacation trip and be study bird flight just for the fun of it and you can watch a bird soar around in circle and measure the time and estimate the bank angle and immediately figure out its speed and the turn radius and so on which I could do in the car as we be drive along on a vacation trip laughter with my three son young son help I but ridicule the whole thing very much but that begin think about how bird go around and then how airplane would how hang glider would fly and then other plane and the idea of the Gossamer Condor type airplane quickly emerge be so logical one should have think of it in the first place but one do not and it be just keep the weight down 70 pound be all it weigh but let the size swell up like a hang glider but three time the span three time the cord you be down to a third of the speed a third of the power and a good bicyclist can put out that power and that work and we win the prize a year late we do not a lot of fly a lot of experiment a lot of thing that do not work and one that do work and the plane keep get a little good a little good get a good pilot Brian Allen to operate it and finally succeed but unfortunately about 65 000 dollar be spend on the project laughter and there be only about 30 to help retire the debt but fortunately Henry Kramer who put up the prize for that be a one mile flight put up a new prize for fly the English Channel 21 mile and he think it would take another 18 year for somebody to win that we realize that if you just clean up we Gossamer Condor a little bit the power to fly would be decrease a little bit and if you decrease the power require a little the pilot can fly a much long period of time and Brian Allen be able in a miraculous flight to get the Gossamer Albatross across the English Channel and we win the 100 000 pound 200 000 dollar prize for that and when all expense be pay the debt be handle and everything be fine it turn out that give the plane to the museum be worth much more than the debt so for five year six year I only have to pay one third income tax so there be good economic reason for the project but laughter that be not well the project be do entirely for economic reason and we have not be involve in any human powered flight since then laughter because the prize be all over laughter but that sure start I think about various thing and immediately we begin make a solar powered plane because we feel solar power be go to be so important for the country and the world we do not want the small funding in the government to be decrease which be what the government be try to do with it and we think a solar powered plane would not really make sense but you could do it and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power and maybe help that field and that project continue do succeed and we then get into other project in aviation and mechanical thing and ground device but while this be go on in 1982 I get a prize from the Lindbergh Foundation they annual prize and I have to prepare a paper on it which collect all my varied thought and varied interest over the year this be the one chance that I have to focus on what I really be after and what be important and to my surprise I realize the importance of environmental issue which Charles Lindbergh devote the last third of he life to and prepare that paper do I a lot of good I think back about if I be a space traveler and come and visit Earth every 5 000 year and for a few thousand visit I would see the same thing every time the little difference in the Earth but this last time just come round right now suddenly there would be huge change in the environment in the concentration of person and it be just unbelievable the amount of all the change in it I want to well one of the big change be 200 year ago we begin use coal from underground which have a lot of pollution and 100 year ago begin get gasoline from underground with a lot of pollution and gasoline consumption or production will reach its limit in about ten year and then go down and we wonder what be go to happen with transportation I want to show the slide this slide I think be the most important one any of you will see ever because laughter applause it show nature versus human and go from 1850 to 2050 and so the year 2000 you see there and this be the weight of all air and land vertebrate human and muskrat and giraffe and bird and so on be the red line go up that be the human and livestock and pet portion the green line go down that be the wild nature portion human livestock and pet be now 98 percent of the total world mass of vertebrate on land and air and you do not know what the future will hold but it be not go to get a low percentage ten thousand year ago the human and livestock and pet be not even one tenth of one percent and would not even have be visible on such a curve now they be 98 percent and it I think show human domination of the Earth I give a talk to some remarkable high school student each summer and ask they after they have ask I question and I give they a talk and so on then I ask they question what be the population of the Earth what be the population of the Earth go to be when you be the age of you parent which I have never really they have never really think about but now they think about it and then what population of the Earth would be a equilibrium that could continue on and be for 2050 2100 2150 and they form little group all fight with each other and when I leave two hour later most of they be say about 2 billion person and they do not have any clue about how to get down to 2 billion nor do I but I think they be right and this be a serious problem Rachel Carson be think of this and come out with Silent Spring way back Solar Manifesto by Hermann Scheer in Germany claim all energy on Earth can be derive for every country from solar energy and water and so on you do not need to dig down for this chemical and we can do thing much more efficiently let have the next slide so this just summarize it over billion of year on a unique sphere chance have paint a thin covering of life complex and probable wonderful and fragile suddenly we human a recently arrive species no long subject to the check and balance inherent in nature have grow in population technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power we now wield the paintbrush we be in charge it be frightening and I do a painting every 20 or 25 year this be the last one laughter and it show the Earth in a time flag on the right in trilobite and dinosaur and so on and over the triangle we now get to civilization and tv and traffic jam and so on I have no idea of what come next so I just use robotic and natural cockroach as the future as a little warning and two week after this drawing be do we actually have we first project contract at AeroVironment on robotic cockroach which be very frightening to I laughter paper rustling well that will be all the slide as time go on we stop we environmental program we focus more on the really serious energy problem of the future and we produce product for the company and we develop the impact car that General Motors make the ev1 out of and get the Air Resources Board to have the regulation that stimulate the electric car but they have since come apart and we have do a lot of thing small drone airplane and so on I have a Helios we have the first video video narrator with a wingspan of 247 foot this make she large than a Boeing 747 Music she designer attention to detail and she construction give Helios structure the flexibility and strength to deal with the turbulence encounter in the atmosphere this enable she to easily ride through the air current as if she be slide along on the ocean wave Paul MacCready the wing could touch together on top and not break we think laughter narrator and Helios now begin the process of turn she back to the sun to maximize the power from she solar array music as the sky get dark and the outside air temperature drop below minus 100 degree Fahrenheit the most environmentally hostile segment of Helios journey have go by without notice except for be record by specially design datum acquisition system and they associate sensor approach a peak radar altitude of 96 863 foot at 4 12 p m helios be stand on top of 98 percent of the Earth atmosphere this be more than 10 000 foot high than the previous world altitude record hold by the SR 71 Blackbird applause pm that plane have many purpose but it be aim for communication and it can fly so slowly that it will just stay up at 65 000 foot eventually it will be able to have to stay up day night day night for six month at a time act like the synchronous satellite but only ten mile above the Earth let have the next video this show the other end of the spectrum video narrator a tiny airplane the av pointer serve for surveillance in effect a pair of rove eyeglass a cutting edge example of where miniaturization can lead if the operator be remote from the vehicle it be convenient to carry assemble and launch by hand battery power it be silent and rarely notice it send high resolution video picture back to the operator with on board gp it can navigate autonomously and it be rugged enough to self land without damage pm okay and let have the next applause that plane be widely use by the military now in all they operation let have the next video Video Music Alan Alda he be get it he be get it he be get it on he head music we be go to end we visit with Paul MacCready fly circus by meet he son Tyler who with he two brother help build the Gossamer Condor 25 year ago Tyler MacCready you can chase it like this for hour aa when they get bored with they father project they invent a extraordinary little plane of they own tm and I can control it by put the lift on one side of the wing or on the other aa they call it they Walkalong Glider Music I have never see anything like that how old be you when you invent that tm oh 10 11 aa oh my God tm 12 something like that aa that be amazing pm and Tyler here to show you the Walkalong applause tm all right you all get a couple of this in you gift bag and one of the first thing the production version seem to dive a little bit and so I would just suggest you bend the wing tip up a little bit before you try fly it I will give you a demonstration of how it work the idea be that it soar on the lift over you body like a seagull soar on a cliff as the wind come up it have to go over the cliff so as you walk through the air it go around you body some have to go over you and so you just keep the glider position in that up current the launch be the difficult part you have get to hold it high up over you head and you start walk forward and just let go of it and you can control it like that laughter and then also like it say in the video you can turn it left or right just by put the lift under one wing or another so I can do it oops that be go to be a right turn laughter okay this one will be a left turn here but applause anyway applause and that be it so you can just control it wherever you want and it be just hour of fun and this be no long in production so you have real collector item laughter and this we just want to show you if we can get the video run on this yeah just a example of a little video surveillance laughter this be fly around in the party last night and laughter you can see how it just can fly around and you can spy on anybody you want laughter and that be it I be go to bring a airplane but I be worry about hit person in here so I think this would be a little bit more gentle and that be it yeah just a few invention applause all right
