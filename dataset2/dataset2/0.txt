good morning how be you laughter it be be great have not it I have be blow away by the whole thing in fact I be leave laughter there have be three theme run through the conference which be relevant to what I want to talk about one be the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentation that we have have and in all of the person here just the variety of it and the range of it the second be that it be put we in a place where we have no idea what be go to happen in term of the future no idea how this may play out I have a interest in education actually what I find be everybody have a interest in education do not you I find this very interesting if you be at a dinner party and you say you work in education actually you be not often at dinner party frankly laughter if you work in education you be not ask laughter and you be never ask back curiously that be strange to I but if you be and you say to somebody you know they say what do you do and you say you work in education you can see the blood run from they face they be like oh my god you know why i laughter my one night out all week laughter but if you ask about they education they pin you to the wall because it be one of that thing that go deep with person be I right like religion and money and other thing so I have a big interest in education and I think we all do we have a huge vested interest in it partly because it be education that be mean to take we into this future that we can not grasp if you think of it child start school this year will be retire in 2065 nobody have a clue despite all the expertise that be be on parade for the past four day what the world will look like in five year time and yet we be mean to be educate they for it so the unpredictability I think be extraordinary and the third part of this be that we have all agree nonetheless on the really extraordinary capacity that child have they capacity for innovation I mean Sirena last night be a marvel be not she just see what she could do and she be exceptional but I think she be not so to speak exceptional in the whole of childhood what you have there be a person of extraordinary dedication who find a talent and my contention be all kid have tremendous talent and we squander they pretty ruthlessly so I want to talk about education and I want to talk about creativity my contention be that creativity now be as important in education as literacy and we should treat it with the same status applause thank you applause that be it by the way thank you very much laughter so 15 minute leave laughter well I be bear no laughter I hear a great story recently I love tell it of a little girl who be in a drawing lesson she be six and she be at the back drawing and the teacher say this girl hardly ever pay attention and in this drawing lesson she do the teacher be fascinate she go over to she and she say what be you draw and the girl say I be draw a picture of God and the teacher say but nobody know what God look like and the girl say they will in a minute laughter when my son be four in England actually he be four everywhere to be honest laughter if we be be strict about it wherever he go he be four that year he be in the Nativity play do you remember the story laughter no it be big it be a big story Mel Gibson do the sequel you may have see it laughter nativity ii but James get the part of Joseph which we be thrilled about we consider this to be one of the lead part we have the place cram full of agent in t shirt James Robinson be Joseph laughter he do not have to speak but you know the bit where the three king come in they come in bear gift gold frankincense and myrrh this really happen we be sit there and I think they just go out of sequence because we talk to the little boy afterward and we say you ok with that and he say yeah why be that wrong they just switch the three boy come in four year old with tea towel on they head and they put this box down and the first boy say I bring you gold and the second boy say I bring you myrrh and the third boy say Frank send this laughter what this thing have in common be that kid will take a chance if they do not know they will have a go be I right they be not frightened of be wrong I do not mean to say that be wrong be the same thing as be creative what we do know be if you be not prepare to be wrong you will never come up with anything original if you be not prepare to be wrong and by the time they get to be adult most kid have lose that capacity they have become frightened of be wrong and we run we company like this we stigmatize mistake and we be now run national education system where mistake be the bad thing you can make and the result be that we be educate person out of they creative capacity Picasso once say this he say that all child be bear artist the problem be to remain a artist as we grow up I believe this passionately that we do not grow into creativity we grow out of it or rather we get educate out of it so why be this I live in Stratford on Avon until about five year ago in fact we move from Stratford to Los Angeles so you can imagine what a seamless transition that be laughter actually we live in a place call Snitterfield just outside Stratford which be where Shakespeare father be bear be you strike by a new thought I be you do not think of Shakespeare have a father do you do you because you do not think of Shakespeare be a child do you Shakespeare be seven I never think of it I mean he be seven at some point he be in somebody English class be not he laughter how annoying would that be laughter must try hard laughter be send to bed by he dad you know to Shakespeare go to bed now and put the pencil down laughter and stop speak like that laughter it be confusing everybody laughter anyway we move from Stratford to Los Angeles and I just want to say a word about the transition my son do not want to come I have get two kid he be 21 now my daughter 16 he do not want to come to Los Angeles he love it but he have a girlfriend in England this be the love of he life Sarah he have know she for a month laughter mind you they would have they fourth anniversary because it be a long time when you be 16 he be really upset on the plane he say I will never find another girl like Sarah and we be rather pleased about that frankly laughter because she be the main reason we be leave the country laughter but something strike you when you move to America and travel around the world every education system on Earth have the same hierarchy of subject every one do not matter where you go you would think it would be otherwise but it be not at the top be mathematics and language then the humanities and at the bottom be the art everywhere on Earth and in pretty much every system too there be a hierarchy within the art art and music be normally give a high status in school than drama and dance there be not a education system on the planet that teach dance everyday to child the way we teach they mathematics why why not I think this be rather important I think math be very important but so be dance child dance all the time if they be allow to we all do we all have body do not we do I miss a meeting laughter truthfully what happen be as child grow up we start to educate they progressively from the waist up and then we focus on they head and slightly to one side if you be to visit education as a alien and say what be it for public education I think you would have to conclude if you look at the output who really succeed by this who do everything that they should who get all the brownie point who be the winner I think you would have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world be to produce university professor be not it they be the person who come out the top and I use to be one so there laughter and I like university professor but you know we should not hold they up as the high water mark of all human achievement they be just a form of life another form of life but they be rather curious and I say this out of affection for they there be something curious about professor in my experience not all of they but typically they live in they head they live up there and slightly to one side they be disembody you know in a kind of literal way they look upon they body as a form of transport for they head laughter do not they it be a way of get they head to meeting laughter if you want real evidence of out of body experience get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academic and pop into the discotheque on the final night laughter and there you will see it grown man and woman writhe uncontrollably off the beat laughter wait until it end so they can go home and write a paper about it laughter we education system be predicate on the idea of academic ability and there be a reason around the world there be no public system of education really before the 19th century they all come into be to meet the need of industrialism so the hierarchy be root on two idea number one that the most useful subject for work be at the top so you be probably steer benignly away from thing at school when you be a kid thing you like on the grounds that you would never get a job do that be that right do not do music you be not go to be a musician do not do art you will not be a artist Benign advice now profoundly mistaken the whole world be engulf in a revolution and the second be academic ability which have really come to dominate we view of intelligence because the university design the system in they image if you think of it the whole system of public education around the world be a protracted process of university entrance and the consequence be that many highly talented brilliant creative person think they be not because the thing they be good at at school be not value or be actually stigmatize and I think we can not afford to go on that way in the next 30 year accord to UNESCO more person worldwide will be graduate through education than since the beginning of history more person and it be the combination of all the thing we have talk about technology and its transformation effect on work and demography and the huge explosion in population suddenly degree be not worth anything be not that true when I be a student if you have a degree you have a job if you do not have a job it be because you do not want one and I do not want one frankly laughter but now kid with degree be often head home to carry on play video game because you need a ma where the previous job require a ba and now you need a phd for the other it be a process of academic inflation and it indicate the whole structure of education be shift beneath we foot we need to radically rethink we view of intelligence we know three thing about intelligence one it be diverse we think about the world in all the way that we experience it we think visually we think in sound we think kinesthetically we think in abstract term we think in movement secondly intelligence be dynamic if you look at the interaction of a human brain as we hear yesterday from a number of presentation intelligence be wonderfully interactive the brain be not divide into compartment in fact creativity which I define as the process of have original idea that have value more often than not come about through the interaction of different disciplinary way of see thing by the way there be a shaft of nerve that join the two half of the brain call the corpus callosum it be thick in woman follow off from Helen yesterday this be probably why woman be well at multi tasking because you be be not you there be a raft of research but I know it from my personal life if my wife be cook a meal at home which be not often thankfully laughter no she be good at some thing but if she be cook she be deal with person on the phone she be talk to the kid she be paint the ceiling she be do open heart surgery over here if I be cook the door be shut the kid be out the phone on the hook if she come in I get annoyed I say Terry please I be try to fry a egg in here laughter give I a break laughter actually do you know that old philosophical thing if a tree fall in a forest and nobody hear it do it happen remember that old chestnut I see a great t shirt recently which say if a man speak he mind in a forest and no woman hear he be he still wrong laughter and the third thing about intelligence be it be distinct I be do a new book at the moment call Epiphany which be base on a series of interview with person about how they discover they talent I be fascinate by how person get to be there it be really prompt by a conversation I have with a wonderful woman who maybe most person have never hear of Gillian Lynne have you hear of she some have she be a choreographer and everybody know she work she do cat and Phantom of the Opera she be wonderful I use to be on the board of the Royal Ballet as you can see anyway Gillian and I have lunch one day and I say how do you get to be a dancer it be interesting when she be at school she be really hopeless and the school in the 30 write to she parent and say we think Gillian have a learning disorder she could not concentrate she be fidget I think now they would say she have adhd would not you but this be the 1930 and adhd have not be invent at this point it be not a available condition laughter person be not aware they could have that laughter anyway she go to see this specialist so this oak panel room and she be there with she mother and she be lead and sit on this chair at the end and she sit on she hand for 20 minute while this man talk to she mother about the problem Gillian be have at school because she be disturb person she homework be always late and so on little kid of eight in the end the doctor go and sit next to Gillian and say I have listen to all this thing you mother tell I I need to speak to she privately wait here we will be back we will not be very long and they go and leave she but as they go out of the room he turn on the radio that be sit on he desk and when they get out he say to she mother just stand and watch she and the minute they leave the room she be on she foot move to the music and they watch for a few minute and he turn to she mother and say Mrs Lynne Gillian be not sick she be a dancer take she to a dance school I say what happen she say she do I can not tell you how wonderful it be we walk in this room and it be full of person like I person who could not sit still person who have to move to think who have to move to think they do ballet they do tap jazz they do modern they do contemporary she be eventually audition for the Royal Ballet School she become a soloist she have a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet she eventually graduate from the Royal Ballet School find the Gillian Lynne Dance Company meet Andrew Lloyd Webber she be be responsible for some of the most successful musical theater production in history she be give pleasure to million and she be a multi millionaire somebody else might have put she on medication and tell she to calm down applause what I think it come to be this Al Gore speak the other night about ecology and the revolution that be trigger by Rachel Carson I believe we only hope for the future be to adopt a new conception of human ecology one in which we start to reconstitute we conception of the richness of human capacity we education system have mine we mind in the way that we strip mine the earth for a particular commodity and for the future it will not serve we we have to rethink the fundamental principle on which we be educate we child there be a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk who say if all the insect be to disappear from the Earth within 50 year all life on Earth would end if all human being disappear from the Earth within 50 year all form of life would flourish and he be right what TED celebrate be the gift of the human imagination we have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenario that we have talk about and the only way we will do it be by see we creative capacity for the richness they be and see we child for the hope that they be and we task be to educate they whole be so they can face this future by the way we may not see this future but they will and we job be to help they make something of it thank you very much applause
