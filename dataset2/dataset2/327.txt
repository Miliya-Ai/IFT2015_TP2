the fragrance that you will smell you will never be able to smell this way again it a fragrance call Beyond Paradise which you can find in any store in the nation except here it be split up in part by Est e Lauder and by the perfumer who do it Calice Becker and I be most grateful to they for this and it be split up in successive bit and a chord so what you be smell now be the top note and then will come what they call the heart the lush heart note I will show it to you the Eden top note be name after the Eden Project in the U K the lush heart note Melaleuca bark note which do not contain any Melaleuca bark because it totally forbid and after that the complete fragrance now what you be smell be a combination of I ask how many molecule there be in there and nobody would tell I so I put it through a g c a gas Chromatograph that I have in my office and it about 400 so what you be smell be several hundred molecule float through the air hit you nose and do not get the impression that this be very subjective you be all smell pretty much the same thing ok smell have this reputation of be somewhat different for each person it not really true and perfumery show you that can not be true because if it be like that it would not be a art ok now while the smell waft over you let I tell you the history of a idea everything that you be smell in here be make up of atom that come from what I call the Upper East side of the periodic table a nice safe neighborhood laughter you really do not want to leave it if you want to have a career in perfumery some person have try in the 1920 to add thing from the bad part and it do not really work this be the five atom from which just about everything that you be go to smell in real life from coffee to fragrance be make of the top note that you smell at the very begin the cut grass green what we call in perfumery they be weird term and this would be call a green note because it smell of something green like cut grass this be cis 3 hexene 1 ol and I have to learn chemistry on the fly in the last three year a very expensive high school chemistry education this have six carbon atom so hexa hexene 1 ol it have one double bond it have a alcohol on the end so it ol and that why they call it cis 3 hexene 1 ol once you figure this out you can really impress person at party this smell of cut grass now this be the skeleton of the molecule if you dress it up with atom hydrogen atom that what it look like when you have it on you computer but actually it sort of more like this in the sense that the atom have a certain sphere that you can not penetrate they repel ok now why do this thing smell of cut grass ok why do not it smell of potato or violet well there be really two theory but the first theory be it must be the shape and that a perfectly reasonable theory in the sense that almost everything else in biology work by shape enzyme that chew thing up antibody it all you know the fit between a protein and whatever it be grab in this case a smell and I will try and explain to you what wrong with this notion and the other theory be that we smell molecular vibration now this be a totally insane idea and when I first come across it in the early 90 I think my predecessor Malcolm Dyson and Bob Wright have really take leave of they sens and I will explain to you why this be the case however I come to realize gradually that they may be right and I have to convince all my colleague that this be so but I be work on it here how shape work in normal receptor you have a molecule come in it get into the protein which be schematic here and it cause this thing to switch to turn to move in some way by bind in certain part and the attraction the force between the molecule and the protein cause the motion this be a shape base idea now what wrong with shape be summarize in this slide the way I expect everybody to memorize this compound this be one page of work from a chemist workbook ok working for a fragrance company He making 45 molecule and he look for a sandalwood something that smell of sandalwood because there a lot of money in sandalwood and of this 45 molecule only 4629 actually smell of sandalwood and he put a exclamation mark ok this be a awful lot of work this actually be roughly in man year of work 200 000 dollar roughly if you keep they on the low salary with no benefit so this be a profoundly inefficient process and my definition of a theory be it not just something that you teach person it labor save a theory be something that enable you to do less work I love the idea of do less work so let I explain to you why a very simple fact that tell you why this shape theory really do not work very well this be cis 3 hexene 1 ol it smell of cut grass this be cis 3 hexene 1 thiol and this smell of rotten egg ok now you will have notice that vodka never smell of rotten egg if it do you put the glass down you go to a different bar this be in other word we never get the o h we never mistake it for a s h ok like at no concentration even pure you know if you smell pure ethanol it do not smell of rotten egg conversely there be no concentration at which the sulfur compound will smell like vodka it very hard to explain this by molecular recognition now I show this to a physicist friend of mine who have a profound distaste for biology and he say that easy the thing be a different color laughter we have to go a little beyond that now let I explain why vibrational theory have some sort of interest in it this molecule as you see in the begin the building block have spring connect they to each other in fact molecule be able to vibrate at a set of frequency which be very specific for each molecule and for the bond connect they so this be the sound of the o h stretch translate into the audible range s h quite a different frequency now this be kind of interesting because it tell you that you should be look for a particular fact which be this nothing in the world smell like rotten egg except s h ok now Fact B nothing in the world have that frequency except s h if you look on this imagine a piano keyboard the s h stretch be in the middle of a part of the keyboard that have be so to speak damage and there be no neighboring note nothing be close to it you have a unique smell a unique vibration so I go search when I start in this game to convince myself that there be any degree of plausibility to this whole crazy story I go search for a type of molecule any molecule that would have that vibration and that the obvious prediction be that it should absolutely smell of sulfur if it do not the whole idea be toast and I might as well move on to other thing now after search high and low for several month I discover that there be a type of molecule call a Borane which have exactly the same vibration now the good news be Boranes you can get hold of the bad news be they be rocket fuel most of they explode spontaneously in contact with air and when you call up the company they only give you minimum ten ton ok laughter so this be not what they call a laboratory scale experiment and they would not have like it at my college however I manage to get a hold of a Borane eventually and here be the beast and it really do have the same if you calculate if you measure the vibrational frequency they be the same as s h now do it smell of sulfur well if you go back in the literature there a man who know more about Boranes than anyone alive then or since Alfred Stock he synthesize all of they and in a enormous 40 page paper in German he say at one point my wife be German and she translate it for I and at one point he say ganz widerlich Geruch a absolutely repulsive smell which be good reminiscent of hydrogen sulfide so this fact that Boranes smell of sulfur have be know since 1910 and utterly forget until 1997 1998 now the slight fly in the ointment be this that if we smell molecular vibration we must have a spectroscope in we nose now this be a spectroscope ok on my laboratory bench and it fair to say that if you look up somebody nose you be unlikely to see anything resemble this and this be the main objection to the theory ok great we smell vibration how all right now when person ask this kind of question they neglect something which be that physicist be really clever unlike biologist laughter this be a joke I be a biologist ok so it a joke against myself Bob Jacklovich and John Lamb at Ford Motor Company in the day when Ford Motor be spend vast amount of money on fundamental research discover a way to build a spectroscope that be intrinsically nano scale in other word no mirror no laser no prism no nonsense just a tiny device and he build this device and this device use electron tunneling now I could do the dance of electron tunneling but I have do a video instead which be much more interesting here how it work Electrons be fuzzy creature and they can jump across gap but only at equal energy if the energy differ they can not jump unlike we they will not fall off the cliff ok now if something absorb the energy the electron can travel so here you have a system you have something and there plenty of that stuff in biology some substance give a electron and the electron try to jump and only when a molecule come along that have the right vibration do the reaction happen ok this be the basis for the device that this two guy at Ford build and every single part of this mechanism be actually plausible in biology in other word I have take off the shelf component and I have make a spectroscope what nice about this idea if you have a philosophical bent of mind be that then it tell you that the nose the ear and the eye be all vibrational sens of course it do not matter because it could also be that they be not but it have a certain laughter it have a certain ring to it which be attractive to person who read too much 19th century German literature and then a magnificent thing happen I leave academia and join the real world of business and a company be create around my idea to make new molecule use my method along the line of let put someone else money where you mouth be and one of the first thing that happen be we start go around to fragrance company ask for what they need because of course if you could calculate smell you do not need chemist you need a computer a Mac will do it if you know how to program the thing right ok so you can try a thousand molecule you can try ten thousand molecule in a weekend and then you only tell the chemist to make the right one and so that a direct path to make new odorant and one of the first thing that happen be we go to see some perfumer in France and here where I do my Charles Fleischer impression and one of they say you can not make a coumarin he say to I I bet you can not make a coumarin now coumarin be a very common thing a material in fragrance which be derive from a bean that come from South America and it be the classic synthetic aroma chemical ok it the molecule that have make man fragrance smell the way they do since 1881 to be exact and the problem be it a carcinogen so nobody like particularly to you know aftershave with carcinogen laughter there be some reckless person but it not worth it ok so they ask we to make a new coumarin and so we start do calculation and the first thing you do be you calculate the vibrational spectrum of coumarin and you smooth it out so that you have a nice picture of what the sort of chord so to speak of coumarin be and then you start crank the computer to find other molecule relate or unrelated that have the same vibration and we actually in this case I be sorry to say it happen it be serendipitous because I get a phone call from we chief chemist and he say look I have just find this such a beautiful reaction that even if this compound do not smell of coumarin I want to do it it just such a nifty one step I mean chemist have weird mind one step 90 percent yield you know and you get this lovely crystalline compound let we try it and I say first of all let I do the calculation on that compound bottom right which be relate to coumarin but have a extra pentagon insert into the molecule calculate the vibration the purple spectrum be that new fellow the white one be the old one and the prediction be it should smell of coumarin they make it and it smell exactly like coumarin and this be we new baby call tonkene you see when you be a scientist you be always sell idea and person be very resistant to idea and rightly so why should new idea be accept but when you put a little 10 gram vial on the table in front of perfumer and it smell like coumarin and it be not coumarin and you have find it in three week this focus everybody mind wonderfully laughter applause and person often ask I be you theory accept and I say well by whom I mean most you know there three attitude you be right and I do not know why which be the most rational one at this point you be right and I do not care how you do it in a sense you bring I the molecule you know and you be completely wrong and I be sure you be completely wrong ok now we be deal with person who only want result and this be the commercial world and they tell we that even if we do it by astrology they be happy but we be not actually do it by astrology but for the last three year I have have what I consider to be the good job in the entire universe which be to put my hobby which be you know fragrance and all the magnificent thing plus a little bit of biophysic a small amount of self teach chemistry at the service of something that actually work thank you very much applause
