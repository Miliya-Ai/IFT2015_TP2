fifty year ago when I begin explore the ocean no one not Jacques Perrin not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson imagine that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we take out of it it seem at that time to be a sea of Eden but now we know and now we be face paradise lose I want to share with you my personal view of change in the sea that affect all of we and to consider why it matter that in 50 year we have lose actually we have take we have eat more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea why you should care that nearly half of the coral reef have disappear why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large area of the Pacific should concern not only the creature that be die but it really should concern you it do concern you as well I be haunt by the thought of what Ray Anderson call tomorrow child ask why we do not do something on we watch to save shark and bluefin tuna and squid and coral reef and the live ocean while there still be time well now be that time I hope for you help to explore and protect the wild ocean in way that will restore the health and in so do secure hope for humankind health to the ocean mean health for we and I hope Jill Tarter wish to engage earthling include dolphin and whale and other sea creature in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe and I hope Jill that someday we will find evidence that there be intelligent life among human on this planet laughter do I say that I guess I do for I as a scientist it all begin in 1953 when I first try scuba it be when I first get to know fish swimming in something other than lemon slice and butter I actually love diving at night you see a lot of fish then that you do not see in the daytime diving day and night be really easy for I in 1970 when I lead a team of aquanaut live underwater for week at a time at the same time that astronaut be put they footprint on the moon in 1979 I have a chance to put my footprint on the ocean floor while use this personal submersible call Jim it be six mile offshore and 1 250 foot down it be one of my favorite bathing suit since then I have use about 30 kind of submarine and I have start three company and a nonprofit foundation call deep search to design and build system to access the deep sea I lead a five year National Geographic expedition the sustainable Seas expedition use this little sub they be so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it and I be live proof astronaut and aquanaut alike really appreciate the importance of air food water temperature all the thing you need to stay alive in space or under the sea I hear astronaut Joe Allen explain how he have to learn everything he could about he life support system and then do everything he could to take care of he life support system and then he point to this and he say Life support system we need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it the poet Auden say thousand have live without love none without water ninety seven percent of Earth water be ocean no blue no green if you think the ocean be not important imagine Earth without it Mars come to mind no ocean no life support system I give a talk not so long ago at the World Bank and I show this amazing image of Earth and I say there it be the World Bank that be where all the asset be and we have be trawl they down much fast than the natural system can replenish they Tim Worth say the economy be a wholly own subsidiary of the environment with every drop of water you drink every breath you take you be connect to the sea no matter where on Earth you live most of the oxygen in the atmosphere be generate by the sea over time most of the planet organic carbon have be absorb and store there mostly by microbe the ocean drive climate and weather stabilize temperature shape Earth chemistry water from the sea form cloud that return to the land and the sea as rain sleet and snow and provide home for about 97 percent of life in the world maybe in the universe no water no life no blue no green yet we have this idea we human that the Earth all of it the ocean the sky be so vast and so resilient it do not matter what we do to it that may have be true 10 000 year ago and maybe even 1 000 year ago but in the last 100 especially in the last 50 we have draw down the asset the air the water the wildlife that make we life possible new technology be help we to understand the nature of nature the nature of what be happen show we we impact on the Earth I mean first you have to know that you have get a problem and fortunately in we time we have learn more about the problem than in all precede history and with know come caring and with care there be hope that we can find a enduring place for ourselves within the natural system that support we but first we have to know three year ago I meet John Hanke who be the head of Google Earth and I tell he how much I love be able to hold the world in my hand and go explore vicariously but I ask he when be you go to finish it you do a great job with the land the dirt what about the water since then I have have the great pleasure of work with the Googlers with DOER Marine with National Geographic with dozen of the good institution and scientist around the world one that we could enlist to put the ocean in Google Earth and as of just this week last Monday Google Earth be now whole consider this start right here at the convention center we can find the nearby aquarium we can look at where we be sit and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium the ocean and California four national marine sanctuary and the new network of state marine reserve that be begin to protect and restore some of the asset we can flit over to Hawaii and see the real hawaiian island not just the little bit that poke through the surface but also what be below to see wait a minute we can go kshhplash right there ha under the ocean see what the whale see we can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands we can go actually and swim around on Google Earth and visit with humpback whale this be the gentle giant that I have have the pleasure of meeting face to face many time underwater there be nothing quite like be personally inspect by a whale we can pick up and fly to the deep place seven mile down the Mariana Trench where only two person have ever be imagine that it be only seven mile but only two person have be there 49 year ago one way trip be easy we need new deep diving submarine how about some X Prizes for ocean exploration we need to see deep trench the undersea mountain and understand life in the deep sea we can now go to the Arctic just ten year ago I stand on the ice at the North Pole a ice free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century that be bad news for the polar bear that be bad news for we too excess carbon dioxide be not only drive global warm it be also change ocean chemistry make the sea more acidic that be bad news for coral reef and oxygen produce plankton also it be bad news for we we be put hundred of million of ton of plastic and other trash into the sea million of ton of discard fishing net gear that continue to kill we be clog the ocean poisoning the planet circulatory system and we be take out hundred of million of ton of wildlife all carbon base unit barbarically we be kill shark for shark fin soup undermine food chain that shape planetary chemistry and drive the carbon cycle the nitrogen cycle the oxygen cycle the water cycle we life support system we be still kill bluefin tuna truly endanger and much more valuable alive than dead all of this part be part of we life support system we kill use long line with bait hook every few foot that may stretch for 50 mile or more industrial trawler and dragger be scrape the sea floor like bulldozer take everything in they path use Google Earth you can witness trawler in China the North Sea the Gulf of Mexico shake the foundation of we life support system leave plume of death in they path the next time you dine on sushi or sashimi or swordfish steak or shrimp cocktail whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean think of the real cost for every pound that go to market more than 10 pound even 100 pound may be throw away as bycatch this be the consequence of not know that there be limit to what we can take out of the sea this chart show the decline in ocean wildlife from 1900 to 2000 the high concentration be in red in my lifetime imagine 90 percent of the big fish have be kill most of the turtle shark tuna and whale be way down in number but there be good news ten percent of the big fish still remain there be still some blue whale there be still some krill in Antarctica there be a few oyster in Chesapeake Bay Half the coral reef be still in pretty good shape a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet there be still time but not a lot to turn thing around but business as usual means that in 50 year there may be no coral reef and no commercial fishing because the fish will simply be go imagine the ocean without fish imagine what that mean to we life support system natural system on the land be in big trouble too but the problem be more obvious and some action be be take to protect tree watershed and wildlife and in 1872 with Yellowstone National Park the United States begin establish a system of park that some say be the good idea America ever have about 12 percent of the land around the world be now protect safeguard biodiversity provide a carbon sink generate oxygen protect watershed and in 1972 this nation begin to establish a counterpart in the sea National Marine Sanctuaries that be another great idea the good news be that there be now more than 4 000 place in the sea around the world that have some kind of protection and you can find they on Google Earth the bad news be that you have to look hard to find they in the last three year for example the U S protect 340 000 square mile of ocean as national monument but it only increase from 0 6 of one percent to 0 8 of one percent of the ocean protect globally protect area do rebind but it take a long time to restore 50 year old rockfish or monkfish shark or sea bass or 200 year old orange roughy we do not consume 200 year old cow or chicken protect area provide hope that the creature of Ed Wilson dream of a encyclopedia of life or the census of marine life will live not just as a list a photograph or a paragraph with scientist around the world I have be look at the 99 percent of the ocean that be open to fishing and mining and drilling and dump and whatever to search out hope spot and try to find way to give they and we a secure future such as the Arctic we have one chance right now to get it right or the Antarctic where the continent be protect but the surround ocean be be strip of its krill whale and fish Sargasso Sea three million square mile of float forest be be gather up to feed cow 97 percent of the land in the Galapagos Islands be protect but the adjacent sea be be ravage by fish it be true too in Argentina on the Patagonian shelf which be now in serious trouble the high sea where whale tuna and dolphin travel the large least protect ecosystem on Earth fill with luminous creature live in dark water that average two mile deep they flash and sparkle and glow with they own live light there be still place in the sea as pristine as I know as a child the next 10 year may be the most important and the next 10 000 year the good chance we species will have to protect what remain of the natural system that give we life to cope with climate change we need new way to generate power we need new way well way to cope with poverty war and disease we need many thing to keep and maintain the world as a good place but nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean we fate and the ocean be one we need to do for the ocean what Al Gore do for the sky above a global plan of action with a world conservation union the IUCN be underway to protect biodiversity to mitigate and recover from the impact of climate change on the high sea and in coastal area wherever we can identify critical place new technology be need to map photograph and explore the 95 percent of the ocean that we have yet to see the goal be to protect biodiversity to provide stability and resilience we need deep diving sub new technology to explore the ocean we need maybe a expedition a TED at sea that could help figure out the next step and so I suppose you want to know what my wish be I wish you would use all means at you disposal film expedition the web new submarine and campaign to ignite public support for a global network of marine protect area hope spot large enough to save and restore the ocean the blue heart of the planet how much some say 10 percent some say 30 percent you decide how much of you heart do you want to protect whatever it be a fraction of one percent be not enough my wish be a big wish but if we can make it happen it can truly change the world and help ensure the survival of what actually as it turn out be my favorite species that would be we for the child of today for tomorrow child as never again now be the time thank you applause
