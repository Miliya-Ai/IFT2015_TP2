Compassion what do it look like come with I to 915 South Bloodworth Street in Raleigh North Carolina where I grow up if you come in you will see we evening time at table set for ten but not always all seat fill at the point when dinner be ready to be serve since mom have eight kid sometimes she say she could not tell who be who and where they be before we could eat she would ask be all the child in and if someone happen to be miss we would have to we say fix a plate for that person put it in the oven then we could say grace and we could eat also while we be at the table there be a ritual in we family when something significant have happen for any one of we whether mom have just be elect as the president of the pta or whether dad have get a assignment at the college of we denomination or whether someone have win the jabberwocky contest for talent the ritual at the family be once the announcement be make we must take five ten minute to do what we call make over that person that be to make a fuss over the one who have be honor in some way for when one be honor all be honor also we have to make a report on we extend visit member that be extend member of the family sick and elderly shut in my task be at least once a week to visit Mother Lassiter who live on East Street Mother Williamson who live on Bledsoe Avenue and Mother Lathers who live on Oberlin Road why because they be old and infirm and we need to go by to see if they need anything for mom say to be family be to care and share and to look out for one another they be we family and of course sometimes there be a bonus for go they would offer sweet or money mom say if they ask you what it cost to either go shopping for they you must always say nothing and if they insist say whatever you mind to give I this be the nature of be at that table in fact she indicate that if we would do that not only would we have the joy of receive the gratitude from the member of the extended family but she say even God will smile and when God smile there be peace and justice and joy so at the table at 915 I learn something about compassion of course it be a minister family so we have to add God into it and so I come to think that mama eternal mama eternal be always wonder be all the child in and if we have be faithful in care and share we have the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world now it be not always wonderful at that table let I explain a point at which we do not rise to the occasion it be Christmas and at we family oh what a morning Christmas morning where we open up we gift where we have special prayer and where we get to the old upright piano and we would sing carol it be a very intimate moment in fact you could come down to the tree to get you gift and get ready to sing and then get ready for breakfast without even take a bath or get dressed except that daddy mess it up there be a member of he staff who do not have any place on that particular Christmas to celebrate and daddy bring eld Revels to the Christmas family celebration we think he must be out of he mind this be we time this be intimate time this be when we can just be who we be and now we have this stuffy brother with he shirt and tie on while we be still in we pj why would daddy bring eld revel any other time but not to the Christmas celebration and mom overhear we and say well you know what if you really understand the nature of this celebration it be that this be a time where you extend the circle of love that be what the celebration be all about it be time to make space to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community so we suck up laughter but grow up at 915 compassion be not a word to be debate it be a sensibility to how we be together we be sister and brother unite together and like Chief Seattle say we do not spin the web of life we be all strand in it and whatever we do to the web we do to ourselves now that be compassion so let I tell you I kind of look at the world this way I see picture and something say now that be compassion a harvest field of grain with some grain in the corner remind I of the hebrew tradition that you may indeed harvest but you must always leave some on the edge just in case there be someone who have not have the share necessary for good nurture talk about a picture of compassion I see always it stir my heart a picture of Dr Martin Luther King Jr walk arm in arm with Andy Young and Rabbi Heschel and maybe Thich Nhat Hanh and some of the other saint assemble walk across the bridge and go into Selma just a photograph arm in arm for struggle suffer together in a common hope that we can be brother and sister without the accident of we birth or we ethnicity rob we of a sense of unity of be so there be another picture here this one I really do like this picture when Dr Martin Luther King Jr be assassinate that day everybody in my community be upset you hear about riot all across the land Bobby Kennedy be schedule to bring a inner city message in Indianapolis this be the picture they say it be go to be too volatile for you to go he insist I must go so sit on a flatbed truck the elder of the community be there and Bobby stand up and say to the person I have bad news for you some of you may not have hear that Dr King have be assassinate I know that you be angry and I know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity to enter now into activity of revenge but he say what I really want you to know be that I know how you feel because I have someone dear to I snatch away I know how you feel and he say I hope that you will have the strength to do what I do I allow my anger my bitterness my grief to simmer a while and then I make up my mind that I be go to make a different world and we can do that together that be a picture Compassion I think I see it I see it when the Dalai Lama come to the Riverside Church while I be a pastor and he invite representative of faith tradition from all around the world he ask they to give a message and they each read in they own language a central affirmation and that be some version of the golden rule as you would that other would do unto you do also unto they twelve in they ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire affirm one message we be so connected that we must treat each other as if a action toward you be a action toward myself one more picture while I be stink and think about the Riverside Church 9 11 last night at chagrin fall a newspaperman and a television guy say that evening when a service be hold at the Riverside Church we carry it on we station in this city it be he say one of the most powerful moment of life together we be all suffer but you invite representative of all of the tradition to come and you invite they find out what it be in you tradition that tell we what to do when we have be humiliate when we have be despise and reject and they all speak out of they own tradition a word about the healing power of solidarity one with the other I develop a sense of compassion sort of as second nature but I become a preacher now as a preacher I get a job I get to preach the stuff but I get to do it too or as Father Divine in Harlem use to say to folk some person preach the Gospel I have to tangibilitate the Gospel so the real issue be how do you tangibilitate compassion how do you make it real my faith have constantly lift up the ideal and challenge I when I fall beneath it in my tradition there be a gift that we have make to other tradition to everybody around the world who know the story of the good Samaritan many person think of it primarily in term of charity random act of kindness but for that who really study that text a little more thoroughly you will discover that a question have be raise that lead to this parable the question be what be the great commandment and accord to Jesus the word come forth you must love yourself you must love the Lord you God with all you heart mind and soul and you neighbor as yourself and then the person ask well what do you mean neighbor and he answer it by tell the story of the man who fall among thief and how religious authority go the other way and how they supporter in the congregation go the other way but a unsuspecting despise person come along see the man in need provide oil and wine for he wound put he on he own transportation and take he to the inn and ask the innkeeper take care of he and he say here this be the initial investment but if need continue make sure that you provide they and whatever else be need I will provide it and pay for it when I return this always seem to I to be a deepening of the sense of what it mean to be a good Samaritan a Good Samaritan be not simply one whose heart be touch in a immediate act of care and charity but one who provide a system of sustained care I like that a system of sustained care in the inn take care I think maybe it be one time when the Bible talk about a healthcare system and a commitment to do whatever be necessary that all God child would have they need care for so that we could answer when mommy eternal ask in regards to health be all the child in and we could say yes oh what a joy it have be to be a person seek to tangibilitate compassion I recall that my work as a pastor have always involve care for they spiritual need be concern for housing for healthcare for the prisoner for the infirm for child even the foster care child for whom no one can even keep a record where they start off where they be go to be a pastor be to care for this individual need but now to be a good Samaritan and I always say and to be a good American for I be not simply to congratulate myself for the individual act of care Compassion take on a corporate dynamic I believe that whatever we do around that table at Bloodworth Street must be do around table and ritual of faith until we become that family that family together that understand the nature of we unity we be one person together so let I explain to you what I mean when I think about compassion and why I think it be so important that right at this point in history we would decide to establish this charter of compassion the reason it be important be because this be a very special time in history it be the time that biblically we would speak of as the day or the year of God favor this be a season of grace unusual thing be begin to happen please pardon I as a black man for celebrate that the election of Obama be a unusual sign of the fact that it be a year of favor and yet there be so much more that need to be do we need to bring health and food and education and respect for all God citizen all God child remember mama eternal now let I close my comment by tell you that whenever I feel something very deeply it usually take the form of verse and so I want to close with a little song I close with this song it be a child song because we be all child at the table of mama eternal and if mama eternal have teach we correctly this song will make sense not only to that of we who be a part of this gathering but to all who sign the charter for compassion and this be why we do it the song say I make heaven so happy today receive God love and give it away when I look up heaven smile at I now I be so happy can not you see I be happy look at I I be happy can not you see share make I happy make heaven happy too I be happy look at I I be happy can not you see let I share my happy loving smile with you that be compassion applause
