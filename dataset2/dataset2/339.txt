unless we do something to prevent it over the next 40 year we be face a epidemic of neurologic disease on a global scale a cheery thought on this map every country that color blue have more than 20 percent of its population over the age of 65 this be the world we live in and this be the world you child will live in for 12 000 year the distribution of age in the human population have look like a pyramid with the old on top it already flatten out by 2050 it go to be a column and will start to invert this be why it happen the average lifespan more than double since 1840 and it increase currently at the rate of about five hour every day and this be why that not entirely a good thing because over the age of 65 you risk of get Alzheimer or Parkinson disease will increase exponentially by 2050 there will be about 32 million person in the United States over the age of 80 and unless we do something about it half of they will have Alzheimer disease and three million more will have Parkinson disease right now that and other neurologic disease for which we have no cure or prevention cost about a third of a trillion dollar a year it will be well over a trillion dollar by 2050 Alzheimer disease start when a protein that should be fold up properly misfold into a kind of demented origami so one approach we be take be to try to design drug that function like molecular Scotch tape to hold the protein into its proper shape that would keep it from form the tangle that seem to kill large section of the brain when they do interestingly enough other neurologic disease which affect very different part of the brain also show tangle of misfold protein which suggest that the approach might be a general one and might be use to cure many neurologic disease not just Alzheimer disease there also a fascinating connection to cancer here because person with neurologic disease have a very low incidence of most cancer and this be a connection that most person be not pursue right now but which we be fascinate by most of the important and all of the creative work in this area be be fund by private philanthropy and there tremendous scope for additional private help here because the government have drop the ball on much of this I be afraid in the meantime while we be wait for all this thing to happen here what you can do for yourself if you want to lower you risk of Parkinson disease caffeine be protective to some extent nobody know why Head injury be bad for you they lead to Parkinson disease and the avian flu be also not a good idea as far as protect yourself against Alzheimer disease well it turn out that fish oil have the effect of reduce you risk for Alzheimer disease you should also keep you blood pressure down because chronic high blood pressure be the big single risk factor for Alzheimer disease it also the big risk factor for glaucoma which be just Alzheimer disease of the eye and of course when it come to cognitive effect use it or lose it apply so you want to stay mentally stimulate but hey you be listen to I so you have get that covered and one final thing wish person like I luck okay because the clock be tick for all of we thank you
