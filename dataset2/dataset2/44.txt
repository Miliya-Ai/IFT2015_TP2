well it be great to be here we have hear a lot about the promise of technology and the peril I have be quite interested in both if we could convert 0 03 percent of the sunlight that fall on the earth into energy we could meet all of we project need for 2030 we can not do that today because solar panel be heavy expensive and very inefficient there be nano engineer design which at least have be analyze theoretically that show the potential to be very lightweight very inexpensive very efficient and we would be able to actually provide all of we energy need in this renewable way Nano engineer fuel cell could provide the energy where it be need that be a key trend which be decentralization move from centralized nuclear power plant and liquid natural gas tanker to decentralize resource that be environmentally more friendly a lot more efficient and capable and safe from disruption Bono speak very eloquently that we have the tool for the first time to address age old problem of disease and poverty most region of the world be move in that direction in 1990 in East Asia and the Pacific region there be 500 million person live in poverty that number now be under 200 million the World Bank project by 2011 it will be under 20 million which be a reduction of 95 percent I do enjoy Bono comment link Haight Ashbury to Silicon Valley be from the Massachusetts high tech community myself I would point out that we be hippie also in the 1960 although we hang around Harvard Square but we do have the potential to overcome disease and poverty and I be go to talk about that issue if we have the will Kevin Kelly talk about the acceleration of technology that be be a strong interest of mine and a theme that I have develop for some 30 year I realize that my technology have to make sense when I finish a project that invariably the world be a different place when I would introduce a technology and I notice that most invention fail not because the r d department can not get it to work if you look at most business plan they will actually succeed if give the opportunity to build what they say they be go to build and 90 percent of that project or more will fail because the timing be wrong not all the enable factor will be in place when they be need so I begin to be a ardent student of technology trend and track where technology would be at different point in time and begin to build the mathematical model of that it be kind of take on a life of its own I have get a group of 10 person that work with I to gather datum on key measure of technology in many different area and we build model and you will hear person say well we can not predict the future and if you ask I will the price of Google be high or low than it be today three year from now that be very hard to say will WiMax CDMA g3 be the wireless standard three year from now that be hard to say but if you ask I what will it cost for one MIPS of compute in 2010 or the cost to sequence a base pair of dna in 2012 or the cost of send a megabyte of datum wirelessly in 2014 it turn out that that be very predictable there be remarkably smooth exponential curve that govern price performance capacity bandwidth and I be go to show you a small sample of this but there be really a theoretical reason why technology develop in a exponential fashion and a lot of person when they think about the future think about it linearly they think they be go to continue to develop a problem or address a problem use today tool at today pace of progress and fail to take into consideration this exponential growth the Genome Project be a controversial project in 1990 we have we good ph d student we most advanced equipment around the world we get 1 10 000th of the project do so how be we go to get this do in 15 year and 10 year into the project the skeptic be still go strong say you be two third through this project and you have manage to only sequence a very tiny percentage of the whole genome but it be the nature of exponential growth that once it reach the knee of the curve it explode most of the project be do in the last few year of the project it take we 15 year to sequence hiv we sequence SARS in 31 day so we be gain the potential to overcome this problem I be go to show you just a few example of how pervasive this phenomena be the actual paradigm shift rate the rate of adopt new idea be double every decade accord to we model this be all logarithmic graph so as you go up the level it represent generally multiply by factor of 10 or 100 it take we half a century to adopt the telephone the first virtual reality technology cell phone be adopt in about eight year if you put different communication technology on this logarithmic graph television radio telephone be adopt in decade recent technology like the pc the web cell phone be under a decade now this be a interesting chart and this really get at the fundamental reason why a evolutionary process and both biology and technology be evolutionary process accelerate they work through interaction they create a capability and then it use that capability to bring on the next stage so the first step in biological evolution the evolution of dna actually it be rna come first take billion of year but then evolution use that information processing backbone to bring on the next stage so the Cambrian Explosion when all the body plan of the animal be evolve take only 10 million year it be 200 time fast and then evolution use that body plan to evolve high cognitive function and biological evolution keep accelerate it be a inherent nature of a evolutionary process so Homo sapiens the first technology create species the species that combine a cognitive function with a opposable appendage and by the way chimpanzee do not really have a very good opposable thumb so we could actually manipulate we environment with a power grip and fine motor coordination and use we mental model to actually change the world and bring on technology but anyway the evolution of we species take hundred of thousand of year and then work through interaction evolution use essentially the technology create species to bring on the next stage which be the first step in technological evolution and the first step take ten of thousand of year stone tool fire the wheel keep accelerate we always use then the late generation of technology to create the next generation Printing press take a century to be adopt the first computer be design pen on paper now we use computer and we have have a continual acceleration of this process now by the way if you look at this on a linear graph it look like everything have just happen but some observer say well Kurzweil just put point on this graph that fall on that straight line so I take 15 different list from key thinker like the Encyclopedia Britannica the Museum of Natural History Carl Sagan cosmic calendar on the same and this person be not try to make my point this be just list in reference work and I think that be what they think the key event be in biological evolution and technological evolution and again it form the same straight line you have a little bit of thickening in the line because person do have disagreement what the key point be there be difference of opinion when agriculture start or how long the Cambrian Explosion take but you see a very clear trend there be a basic profound acceleration of this evolutionary process information technology double they capacity price performance bandwidth every year and that be a very profound explosion of exponential growth a personal experience when I be at MIT computer take up about the size of this room less powerful than the computer in you cell phone but Moore Law which be very often identify with this exponential growth be just one example of many because it be basically a property of the evolutionary process of technology I put 49 famous computer on this logarithmic graph by the way a straight line on a logarithmic graph be exponential growth that be another exponential it take we three year to double we price performance of compute in 1900 two year in the middle we be now double it every one year and that be exponential growth through five different paradigm Moore Law be just the last part of that where we be shrink transistor on a integrated circuit but we have electro mechanical calculator relay base computer that crack the German Enigma Code vacuum tube in the 1950 predict the election of Eisenhower discreet transistor use in the first space flight and then Moore Law every time one paradigm run out of steam another paradigm come out of left field to continue the exponential growth they be shrink vacuum tube make they small and small that hit a wall they could not shrink they and keep the vacuum whole different paradigm transistor come out of the woodwork in fact when we see the end of the line for a particular paradigm it create research pressure to create the next paradigm and because we have be predict the end of Moore Law for quite a long time the first prediction say 2002 until now it say 2022 but by the teen year the feature of transistor will be a few atom in width and we will not be able to shrink they any more that will be the end of Moore Law but it will not be the end of the exponential growth of computing because chip be flat we live in a three dimensional world we might as well use the third dimension we will go into the third dimension and there be be tremendous progress just in the last few year of get three dimensional self organize molecular circuit to work we will have that ready well before Moore Law run out of steam supercomputer same thing Processor performance on Intel chip the average price of a transistor 1968 you could buy one transistor for a dollar you could buy 10 million in 2002 it be pretty remarkable how smooth a exponential process that be I mean you would think this be the result of some tabletop experiment but this be the result of worldwide chaotic behavior country accuse each other of dump product ipo bankruptcy market program you would think it would be a very erratic process and you have a very smooth outcome of this chaotic process just as we can not predict what one molecule in a gas will do it be hopeless to predict a single molecule yet we can predict the property of the whole gas use thermodynamics very accurately it be the same thing here we can not predict any particular project but the result of this whole worldwide chaotic unpredictable activity of competition and the evolutionary process of technology be very predictable and we can predict this trend far into the future unlike Gertrude Stein rose it be not the case that a transistor be a transistor as we make they small and less expensive the electron have less distance to travel they be fast so you have get exponential growth in the speed of transistor so the cost of a cycle of one transistor have be come down with a halve rate of 1 1 year you add other form of innovation and processor design you get a doubling of price performance of compute every one year and that be basically deflation 50 percent deflation and it be not just computer I mean it be true of dna sequencing it be true of brain scan it be true of the world wide web I mean anything that we can quantify we have hundred of different measurement of different information related measurement capacity adoption rate and they basically double every 12 13 15 month depend on what you be look at in term of price performance that be a 40 to 50 percent deflation rate and economist have actually start worry about that we have deflation during the Depression but that be collapse of the money supply collapse of consumer confidence a completely different phenomenon this be due to great productivity but the economist say but there be no way you be go to be able to keep up with that if you have 50 percent deflation person may increase they volume 30 40 percent but they will not keep up with it but what we be actually see be that we actually more than keep up with it we have have 28 percent per year compound growth in dollar in information technology over the last 50 year I mean person do not build iPods for 10 000 dollar 10 year ago as the price performance make new application feasible new application come to the market and this be a very widespread phenomena magnetic datum storage that be not Moore Law it be shrink magnetic spot different engineer different company same exponential process a key revolution be that we be understand we own biology in this information term we be understand the software program that make we body run this be evolve in very different time we would like to actually change that program one little software program call the fat insulin receptor gene basically say hold onto every calorie because the next hunting season may not work out so well that be in the interest of the species ten of thousand of year ago we would like to actually turn that program off they try that in animal and this mouse eat ravenously and remain slim and get the health benefit of be slim they do not get diabetes they do not get heart disease they live 20 percent long they get the health benefit of caloric restriction without the restriction four or five pharmaceutical company have notice this feel that would be interesting drug for the human market and that be just one of the 30 000 gene that affect we biochemistry we be evolve in a era where it be not in the interest of person at the age of most person at this conference like myself to live much long because we be use up the precious resource which be good deploy towards the child and that care for they so life long lifespan like that be to say much more than 30 be not select for but we be learn to actually manipulate and change this software program through the biotechnology revolution for example we can inhibit gene now with rna interference there be exciting new form of gene therapy that overcome the problem of place the genetic material in the right place on the chromosome there be actually a for the first time now something go to human trial that actually cure pulmonary hypertension a fatal disease use gene therapy so we will have not just designer baby but designer baby boomer and this technology be also accelerate it cost 10 dollar per base pair in 1990 then a penny in 2000 it be now under a 10th of a cent the amount of genetic datum basically this show that smooth exponential growth double every year enable the genome project to be complete another major revolution the communication revolution the price performance bandwidth capacity of communication measure many different way wire wireless be grow exponentially the internet have be double in power and continue to measure many different way this be base on the number of host miniaturization we be shrink the size of technology at a exponential rate both wired and wireless this be some design from Eric Drexler book which we be now show be feasible with super computing simulation where actually there be scientist build molecule scale robot one have one that actually walk with a surprisingly human like gait that be build out of molecule there be little machine do thing in experimental basis the most exciting opportunity be actually to go inside the human body and perform therapeutic and diagnostic function and this be less futuristic than it may sound this thing have already be do in animal there be one nano engineer device that cure type 1 diabetes it be blood cell sized they put ten of thousand of this in the blood cell they try this in rat it let insulin out in a control fashion and actually cure type 1 diabetes what you be watch be a design of a robotic red blood cell and it do bring up the issue that we biology be actually very sub optimal even though it be remarkable in its intricacy once we understand its principle of operation and the pace with which we be reverse engineering biology be accelerate we can actually design this thing to be thousand of time more capable a analysis of this respirocyte design by Rob Freitas indicate if you replace 10 percent of you red blood cell with this robotic version you could do a Olympic sprint for 15 minute without take a breath you could sit at the bottom of you pool for four hour so Honey I be in the pool will take on a whole new meaning it will be interesting to see what we do in we Olympic trial presumably we will ban they but then we will have the specter of teenager in they high school gym routinely out perform the Olympic athlete Freitas have a design for a robotic white blood cell this be 2020 circa scenario but they be not as futuristic as it may sound there be four major conference on build blood cell sized device there be many experiment in animal there be actually one go into human trial so this be feasible technology if we come back to we exponential growth of computing 1 000 dollar of computing be now somewhere between a insect and a mouse brain it will intersect human intelligence in term of capacity in the 2020 but that will be the hardware side of the equation where will we get the software well it turn out we can see inside the human brain and in fact not surprisingly the spatial and temporal resolution of brain scanning be double every year and with the new generation of scanning tool for the first time we can actually see individual inter neural fiber and see they processing and signaling in real time but then the question be ok we can get this datum now but can we understand it Doug Hofstadter wonder well maybe we intelligence just be not great enough to understand we intelligence and if we be smart well then we brain would be that much more complicated and we would never catch up to it it turn out that we can understand it this be a block diagram of a model and simulation of the human auditory cortex that actually work quite well in apply psychoacoustic test get very similar result to human auditory perception there be another simulation of the cerebellum that be more than half the neuron in the brain again work very similarly to human skill formation this be at a early stage but you can show with the exponential growth of the amount of information about the brain and the exponential improvement in the resolution of brain scanning we will succeed in reverse engineering the human brain by the 2020 we have already have very good model and simulation of about 15 region out of the several hundred all of this be drive exponentially grow economic progress we have have productivity go from 30 dollar to 150 dollar per hour of labor in the last 50 year e commerce have be grow exponentially it be now a trillion dollar you might wonder well be not there a boom and a bust that be strictly a capital market phenomena Wall Street notice that this be a revolutionary technology which it be but then six month later when it have not revolutionize all business model they figure well that be wrong and then we have this bust all right this be a technology that we put together use some of the technology we be involve in this will be a routine feature in a cell phone it would be able to translate from one language to another so let I just end with a couple of scenario by 2010 computer will disappear they will be so small they will be embed in we clothing in we environment image will be write directly to we retina provide full immersion virtual reality augment real reality we will be interact with virtual personality but if we go to 2029 we really have the full maturity of this trend and you have to appreciate how many turn of the screw in term of generation of technology which be get fast and fast we will have at that point I mean we will have two to the 25th power great price performance capacity and bandwidth of this technology which be pretty phenomenal it will be million of time more powerful than it be today we will have complete the reverse engineering of the human brain 1 000 dollar of computing will be far more powerful than the human brain in term of basic raw capacity computer will combine the subtle pan recognition power of human intelligence with way in which machine be already superior in term of do analytic thinking remember billion of fact accurately Machines can share they knowledge very quickly but it be not just a alien invasion of intelligent machine we be go to merge with we technology this nano bot I mention will first be use for medical and health application clean up the environment provide powerful fuel cell and widely distribute decentralized solar panel and so on in the environment but they will also go inside we brain interact with we biological neuron we have demonstrate the key principle of be able to do this so for example full immersion virtual reality from within the nervous system the nano bot shut down the signal come from you real sens replace they with the signal that you brain would be receive if you be in the virtual environment and then it will feel like you be in that virtual environment you can go there with other person have any kind of experience with anyone involve all of the sens experience beamer I call they will put they whole flow of sensory experience in the neurological correlate of they emotion out on the Internet you can plug in and experience what it be like to be someone else but most importantly it will be a tremendous expansion of human intelligence through this direct merger with we technology which in some sense we be do already we routinely do intellectual feat that would be impossible without we technology human life expectancy be expand it be 37 in 1800 and with this sort of biotechnology nano technology revolution this will move up very rapidly in the year ahead my main message be that progress in technology be exponential not linear many even scientist assume a linear model so they will say oh it will be hundred of year before we have self replicate nano technology assembly or artificial intelligence if you really look at the power of exponential growth you will see that this thing be pretty soon at hand and information technology be increasingly encompass all of we life from we music to we manufacturing to we biology to we energy to material we will be able to manufacture almost anything we need in the 2020 from information in very inexpensive raw material use nano technology this be very powerful technology they both empower we promise and we peril so we have to have the will to apply they to the right problem thank you very much applause
