applause I want to talk to you a little bit about user generate content I be go to tell you three story on the way to one argument that be go to tell you a little bit about how we open user generate content up for business so here be the first story 1906 this man John Philip Sousa travel to this place the United States Capitol to talk about this technology what he call the quote talk machine Sousa be not a fan of the talk machine this be what he have to say this talk machine be go to ruin artistic development of music in this country when I be a boy in front of every house in the summer evening you would find young person together sing the song of the day or the old song today you hear this infernal machine go night and day we will not have a vocal chord leave Sousa say the vocal chord will be eliminate by a process of evolution as be the tail of man when he come from the ape now this be the picture I want you to focus on this be a picture of culture we could describe it use modern computer terminology as a kind of read write culture it be a culture where person participate in the creation and the re creation of they culture in that sense it be read write Sousa fear be that we would lose that capacity because of this quote infernal machine they would take it away and in its place we would have the opposite of read write culture what we could call read only culture culture where creativity be consume but the consumer be not a creator a culture which be top down own where the vocal chord of the million have be lose now as you look back at the twentieth century at least in what we think of as the quote develop world hard not to conclude that Sousa be right never before in the history of human culture have it be as professionalize never before as concentrate never before have creativity of the million be as effectively displace and displace because of this quote infernal machine the twentieth century be that century where at least for that place we know the good culture move from this read write to read only existence so second land be a kind of property it be property it be protect by law as Lord Blackstone describe it land be protect by trespass law for most of the history of trespass law by presume it protect the land all the way down below and to a indefinite extent upward now that be a pretty good system for most of the history of the regulation of land until this technology come along and person begin to wonder be this instrument trespasser as they fly over land without clear the right of the farm below as they travel across the country well in 1945 Supreme Court get a chance to address that question two farmer Thomas Lee and Tinie Causby who raise chicken have a significant complaint because of this technology the complaint be that they chicken follow the pattern of the airplane and fly themselves into the wall of the barn when the airplane fly over the land and so they appeal to Lord Blackstone to say this airplane be trespassing since time immemorial the law have say you can not fly over the land without permission of the landowner so this flight must stop well the Supreme Court consider this 100 year tradition and say in a opinion write by Justice Douglas that the Causbys must lose the Supreme Court say the doctrine protect land all the way to the sky have no place in the modern world otherwise every transcontinental flight would subject the operator to countless trespass suit common sense a rare idea in the law but here it be common sense laughter revolt at the idea common sense finally before the internet the last great terror to rain down on the content industry be a terror create by this technology Broadcasting a new way to spread content and therefore a new battle over the control of the business that would spread content now at that time the entity the legal cartel that control the performance right for most of the music that would be broadcast use this technology be ASCAP they have a exclusive license on the most popular content and they exercise it in a way that try to demonstrate to the broadcaster who really be in charge so between 1931 and 1939 they raise rate by some 448 percent until the broadcaster finally get together and say okay enough of this and in 1939 a lawyer Sydney Kaye start something call Broadcast Music Inc we know it as bmi and bmi be much more democratic in the art that it would include within its repertoire include African American music for the first time in the repertoire but most important be that bmi take public domain work and make arrangement of they which they give away for free to they subscriber so that in 1940 when ASCAP threaten to double they rate the majority of broadcaster switch to bmi now ASCAP say they do not care the person will revolt they predict because the very good music be no long available because they have shift to the second good public domain provide by bmi well they do not revolt and in 1941 ASCAP crack and the important point to recognize be that even though this broadcaster be broadcast something you would call second good that competition be enough to break at that time this legal cartel over access to music okay three story here be the argument in my view the most significant thing to recognize about what this internet be do be its opportunity to revive the read write culture that Sousa romanticize Digital technology be the opportunity for the revival of this vocal chord that he speak so passionately to Congress about user generate content spread in business in extraordinarily valuable way like this celebrate amateur culture by which I do not mean amateurish culture I mean culture where person produce for the love of what they be do and not for the money I mean the culture that you kid be produce all the time for when you think of what Sousa romanticize in the young person together sing the song of the day of the old song you should recognize what you kid be do right now take the song of the day and the old song and remix they to make they something different it be how they understand access to this culture so let have some very few example to get a sense of what I be talk about here here be something call Anime Music Video first example take anime capture from television re edit to music track music this one you should be confidence Jesus survive do not worry music laughter and this be the good music my love there be only you in my life the only thing that be bright my first love you be every breath that I take you be every step I make and I I want to share all my love with you no one else will do and you eye they tell I how much you care music so this be remix right applause and it be important to emphasize that what this be not be not what we call quote piracy I be not talk about nor justify person take other person content in wholesale and distribute it without the permission of the copyright owner I be talk about person take and recreate use other person content use digital technology to say thing differently now the importance of this be not the technique that you have see here because of course every technique that you have see here be something that television and film producer have be able to do for the last 50 year the importance be that that technique have be democratize it be now anybody with access to a 1 500 computer who can take sound and image from the culture around we and use it to say thing differently this tool of creativity have become tool of speech it be a literacy for this generation this be how we kid speak it be how we kid think it be what you kid be as they increasingly understand digital technology and they relationship to themselves now in response to this new use of culture use digital technology the law have not greet this Sousa revival with very much common sense instead the architecture of copyright law and the architecture of digital technology as they interact have produce the presumption that this activity be illegal because if copyright law at its core regulate something call copy then in the digital world the one fact we can not escape be that every single use of culture produce a copy every single use therefore require permission without permission you be a trespasser you be a trespasser with about as much sense as this person be trespasser common sense here though have not yet revolt in response to this response that the law have offer to this form of creativity instead what we have see be something much bad than a revolt there be a grow extremism that come from both side in this debate in response to this conflict between the law and the use of this technology one side build new technology such as one recently announce that will enable they to automatically take down from site like YouTube any content that have any copyright content in it whether or not there be a judgment of fair use that might be apply to the use of that content and on the other side among we kid there be a grow copyright abolitionism a generation that reject the very notion of what copyright be suppose to do reject copyright and believe that the law be nothing more than a ass to be ignore and to be fight at every opportunity possible the extremism on one side beget extremism on the other a fact we should have learn many many time over and both extreme in this debate be just wrong now the balance that I try to fight for I as any good liberal try to fight for first by look to the government total mistake right laughter look first to the court and the legislature to try to get they to do something to make the system make more sense it fail partly because the court be too passive partly because the legislature be corrupt by which I do not mean that there be bribery operating to stop real change but more the economy of influence that govern how Congress function mean that policymaker here will not understand this until it be too late to fix it so we need something different we need a different kind of solution and the solution here in my view be a private solution a solution that look to legalize what it be to be young again and to realize the economic potential of that and that be where the story of bmi become relevant because as bmi demonstrate competition here can achieve some form of balance the same thing can happen now we do not have a public domain to draw upon now so instead what we need be two type of change first that artist and creator embrace the idea choose that they work be make available more freely so for example they can say they work be available freely for non commercial this amateur type of use but not freely for any commercial use and second we need the business that be build out this read write culture to embrace this opportunity expressly to enable it so that this ecology of free content or free content can grow on a neutral platform where they both exist simultaneously so that more free can compete with less free and the opportunity to develop the creativity in that competition can teach one the lesson of the other now I would talk about one particular such plan that I know something about but I do not want to violate TED first commandment of sell so I be not go to talk about this at all I be instead just go to remind you of the point that bmi teach we that artist choice be the key for new technology have a opportunity to be open for business and we need to build artist choice here if this new technology be to have that opportunity but let I end with something I think much more important much more important than business it be the point about how this connect to we kid we have to recognize they be different from we this be we right laughter we make mixed tape they remix music we watch tv they make tv it be technology that have make they different and as we see what this technology can do we need to recognize you can not kill the instinct the technology produce we can only criminalize it we can not stop we kid from use it we can only drive it underground we can not make we kid passive again we can only make they quote pirate and be that good we live in this weird time it be kind of age of prohibition where in many area of we life we live life constantly against the law ordinary person live life against the law and that be what I we be do to we kid they live life know they live it against the law that realization be extraordinarily corrosive extraordinarily corrupting and in a democracy we ought to be able to do good do good at least for they if not for opening for business thank you very much applause
