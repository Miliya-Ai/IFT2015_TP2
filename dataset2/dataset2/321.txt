I want to open by quote Einstein wonderful statement just so person will feel at ease that the great scientist of the 20th century also agree with we and also call we to this action he say a human being be a part of the whole call by we the universe a part limit in time and space he experience himself he thought and feeling as something separate from the rest a kind of optical delusion of he consciousness this delusion be a kind of prison for we restrict we to we personal desire and to affection for a few person near to we we task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widen we circle of compassion to embrace all live creature and the whole of nature in its beauty this insight of Einstein be uncannily close to that of buddhist psychology wherein compassion karuna it be call be define as the sensitivity to another be suffer and the correspond will to free the other from that suffer it pair closely with love which be the will for the other to be happy which require of course that one feel some happiness oneself and wish to share it this be perfect in that it clearly oppose self centeredness and selfishness to compassion the concern for other and further it indicate that that catch in the cycle of self concern suffer helplessly while the compassionate be more free and implicitly more happy the Dalai Lama often state that compassion be he good friend it help he when he be overwhelmed with grief and despair Compassion help he turn away from the feeling of he suffering as the most absolute most terrible suffering anyone have ever have and broaden he awareness of the suffering of other even of the perpetrator of he misery and the whole mass of being in fact suffering be so huge and enormous he own become less and less monumental and he begin to move beyond he self concern into the broad concern for other and this immediately cheer he up as he courage be stimulate to rise to the occasion thus he use he own suffering as a doorway to widen he circle of compassion he be a very good colleague of Einstein we must say now I want to tell a story which be a very famous story in the Indian and buddhist tradition of the great Saint Asanga who be a contemporary of Augustine in the West and be sort of like the Buddhist Augustine and Asanga live 800 year after the Buddha time and he be discontented with the state of person practice of the buddhist religion in India at that time and so he say I be sick of all this nobody really live the doctrine they be talk about love and compassion and wisdom and enlightenment but they be act selfish and pathetic so Buddha teaching have lose its momentum I know the next Buddha will come a few thousand year from now but exist currently in a certain heaven that be Maitreya so I be go to go on a retreat and I be go to meditate and pray until the Buddha Maitreya reveal himself to I and give I a teaching or something to revive the practice of compassion in the world today so he go on this retreat and he meditate for three year and he do not see the future Buddha Maitreya and he leave in disgust and as he be leave he see a man a funny little man sit sort of part way down the mountain and he have a lump of iron and he be rub it with a cloth and he become interested in that he say well what be you do and the man say I be make a needle and he say that be ridiculous you can not make a needle by rub a lump of iron with a cloth and the man say really and he show he a dish full of needle so he say okay I get the point he go back to he cave he meditate again another three year no vision he leave again this time he come down and as he be leave he see a bird make a nest on a cliff ledge and where it be land to bring the twig to the cliff its feather brush the rock and it have cut the rock six to eight inch in there be a cleft in the rock by the brush of the feather of generation of the bird so he say all right I get the point he go back another three year again no vision of Maitreya after nine year and he again leave and this time water drip make a giant bowl in the rock where it drip in a stream and so again he go back and after 12 year there be still no vision and he be freak out and he will not even look left or right to see any encouraging vision and he come to the town he be a broken person and there in the town he be approach by a dog who come like this one of this terrible dog you can see in some poor country even in America I think in some area and he be look just terrible and he become interested in this dog because it be so pathetic and it be try to attract he attention and he sit down look at the dog and the dog whole hindquarter be a complete open sore some of it be like gangrenous and there be maggot in the flesh and it be terrible he think what can I do to fix up this dog well at least I can clean this wound and wash it so he take it to some water he be about to clean but then he awareness focus on the maggot and he see the maggot and the maggot be kind of look a little cute and they be maggote happily in the dog hindquarter there well if I clean the dog I will kill the maggot so how can that be that be it I be a useless person and there be no Buddha no Maitreya and everything be all hopeless and now I be go to kill the maggot so he have a brilliant idea and he take a shard of something and cut a piece of flesh from he thigh and he place it on ground he be not really think too carefully about the ASPCA he be just immediately catch with the situation so he think I will take the maggot and put they on this piece of flesh then clean the dog wound and then I will figure out what to do with the maggot so he start to do that he can not grab the maggot apparently they wriggle around they be kind of hard to grab this maggot so he say well I will put my tongue on the dog flesh and then the maggot will jump on my warm tongue the dog be kind of use up and then I will spit they one by one down on the thing so he go down and he be stick he tongue out like this and he have to close he eye it be so disgusting and the smell and everything and then suddenly there be a pfft a noise like that he jump back and there of course be the future Buddha Maitreya in a beautiful vision rainbow light golden jewel a plasma body a exquisite mystic vision that he see and he say oh he bow but be human he be immediately think of he next complaint so as he come up from he first bow he say my Lord I be so happy to see you but where have you be for 12 year what be this and Maitreya say I be with you who do you think be make needle and make nest and drip on rock for you mister dense laughter look for the Buddha in person he say and he say you do not have until this moment real compassion and until you have real compassion you can not recognize love Maitreya mean love the love one in Sanskrit and so he look very dubious Asanga do and he say if you do not believe I just take I with you and so he take the Maitreya it shrink into a globe a ball take he on he shoulder and he run into town in the marketplace and he say rejoice rejoice the future Buddha have come ahead of all prediction here he be and then pretty soon they start throw rock and stone at he it be not chautauqua it be some other town because they see a demented look scrawny look yogi man like some kind of hippie with a bleeding leg and a rotten dog on he shoulder shout that the future Buddha have come so naturally they chase he out of town but on the edge of town one elderly lady a charwoman in the charnel ground see a jeweled foot on a jeweled lotus on he shoulder and then the dog but she see the jewel foot of the Maitreya and she offer a flower so that encourage he and he go with Maitreya Maitreya then take he to a certain heaven which be the typical way a buddhist myth unfold and Maitreya then keep he in heaven for five year dictate to he five complicated tome of the methodology of how you cultivate compassion and then I think I would share with you what that method be or one of they a famous one it be call the Sevenfold Causal Method of develop Compassion and it begin first by one meditate and visualize that all being be with one even animal too but everyone be in human form the animal be in one of they human life the human be human and then among they you think of you friend and love one the circle at the table and you think of you enemy and you think of the neutral one and then you try to say well the loved one I love but you know after all they be nice to I I have fight with they sometimes they be unfriendly I get mad brother can fight parent and child can fight so in a way I like they so much because they be nice to I while the neutral one I do not know they could all be just fine and then the enemy I do not like because they be mean to I but they be nice to somebody I could be they and then the Buddhists of course think that because we have all have infinite previous life we have all be each other relative actually therefore all of you in the buddhist view in some previous life although you do not remember it and neither do I have be my mother for which I do apologize for the trouble I cause you and also actually I have be you mother I have be female and I have be every single one of yours mother in a previous life the way the Buddhists reflect so my mother in this life be really great but all of you in a way be part of the eternal mother you give I that expression the eternal mama you say that be wonderful so that be the way the Buddhists do it a theist Christian can think that all being even my enemy be God child so in that sense we be related so they first create this foundation of equality so we sort of reduce a little of the cling to the one we love just in the meditation and we open we mind to that we do not know and we definitely reduce the hostility and the I do not want to be compassionate to they to the one we think of as the bad guy the one we hate and we do not like and we do not hate anyone therefore so we equalize that be very important and then the next thing we do be what be call mother recognition and that be we think of every being as familiar as family we expand we take the feeling about remember a mama and we defuse that to all being in this meditation and we see the mother in every be we see that look that the mother have on she face look at this child that be a miracle that she have produce from she own body be a mammal where she have true compassion truly be the other and identify completely often the life of that other will be more important to she than she own life and that be why it be the most powerful form of altruism the mother be the model of all altruism for human being in spiritual tradition and so we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all being person laugh at I because you know I use to say that I use to meditate on mama Cheney as my mom when of course I be annoyed with he about all of he evil doings in Iraq I use to meditate on George Bush he be quite a cute mom in a female form he have he little ear and he smile and he rock you in he arm and you think of he as nursing you and then Saddam Hussein serious mustache be a problem but you think of he as a mom and this be the way you do it you take any being who look weird to you and you see how they could be familiar to you and you do that for a while until you really feel that you can feel the familiarity of all being nobody seem alien they be not other you reduce the feeling of otherness about being then you move from there to remember the kindness of mother in general if you can remember the kindness of you own mother if you can remember the kindness of you spouse or if you be a mother yourself how you be with you child and you begin to get very sentimental you cultivate sentimentality intensely you will even weep perhaps with gratitude and kindness and then you connect that with you feeling that everyone have that motherly possibility every be even the most mean look one can be motherly and then third you step from there to what be call a feeling of gratitude you want to repay that kindness that all being have show to you and then the fourth step you go to what be call lovely love in each one of this you can take some week or month or day depend on how you do it or you can do they in a run this meditation and then you think of how lovely being be when they be happy when they be satisfied and every be look beautiful when they be internally feel a happiness they face do not look like this when they be angry they look ugly every being but when they be happy they look beautiful and so you see being in they potential happiness and you feel a love toward they and you want they to be happy even the enemy we think Jesus be be unrealistic when he say Love thine enemy he do say that and we think he be be unrealistic and sort of spiritual and highfalutin nice for he to say it but I can not do that but actually that be practical if you love you enemy that mean you want you enemy to be happy if you enemy be really happy why would they bother to be you enemy how boring to run around chase you they would be relax somewhere have a good time so it make sense to want you enemy to be happy because they will stop be you enemy because that be too much trouble but anyway that be the lovely love and then finally the fifth step be compassion universal compassion and that be where you then look at the reality of all the being you can think of and you look at they and you see how they be and you realize how unhappy they be actually mostly most of the time you see that furrow brow in person and then you realize they do not even have compassion on themselves they be drive by this duty and this obligation I have to get that I need more I be not worthy and I should do something and they be rush around all stress out and they think of it as somehow macho hard discipline on themselves but actually they be cruel to themselves and of course they be cruel and ruthless toward other and they then never get any positive feedback and the more they succeed and the more power they have the more unhappy they be and this be where you feel real compassion for they and you then feel you must act and the choice of the action of course hopefully will be more practical than poor Asanga who be fix the maggot on the dog because he have that motivation and whoever be in front of he he want to help but of course that be impractical he should have found the ASPCA in the town and get some scientific help for dog and maggot and I be sure he do that later laughter but that just indicate the state of mind you know and so the next step the sixth step beyond universal compassion be this thing where you be link with the need of other in a true way and you have compassion for yourself also and it be not sentimental only you might be in fear of something some bad guy be make himself more and more unhappy be more and more mean to other person and get punish in the future for it in various way and in Buddhism they catch it in the future life of course in theistic religion they be punish by God or whatever and materialism they think they get out of it just by not exist by die but they do not and so they get reborn as whatever you know never mind I will not get into that but the next step be call universal responsibility and that be very important the Charter of Compassion must lead we to develop through true compassion what be call universal responsibility in the great teaching of he holiness the Dalai Lama that he always teach everywhere he say that that be the common religion of humanity kindness but kindness mean universal responsibility and that mean whatever happen to other being be happen to we we be responsible for that and we should take it and do whatever we can at whatever little level and small level that we can do it we absolutely must do that there be no way not to do it and then finally that lead to a new orientation in life where we live equally for ourselves and for other and we be joyful and happy one thing we must not think be that compassion make you miserable Compassion make you happy the first person who be happy when you get great compassion be yourself even if you have not do anything yet for anybody else although the change in you mind already do something for other being they can sense this new quality in yourself and it help they already and give they a example and that uncompassionate clock have just show I that it be all over so practice compassion read the charter disseminate it and develop it within yourself do not just think well I be compassionate or I be not compassionate and sort of think you be stuck there you can develop this you can diminish the non compassion the cruelty the callousness the neglect of other and take universal responsibility for they and then not only will God smile and the eternal mama will smile but Karen Armstrong will smile thank you very much applause
