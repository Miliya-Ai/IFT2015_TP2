this be very strange for I because I be not use to do this I usually stand on the other side of the light and now I be feel the pressure I put other person into and it be hard the previous speaker have I think really paint a very good background as to the impulse behind my work and what drive I and my sense of loss and try to find the answer to the big question but this for I I mean come here to do this feel like there this sculptor that I like very much Giacometti who after many year of live in France and learn you know study and work he return home and he be ask what do you produce what have you do with so many year of be away and he sort of he show a handful of figurine and obviously they be be this what you spend year do and we expect huge masterpiece but what strike I be the understanding that in that little piece be the culmination of a man life search think everything just in a reduce small version in a way I feel like that I feel like I be come home to talk about what I have be away do for 20 year and I will start with a brief taster of what I have be about a handful of film nothing much two feature film and a handful of short film so we will go with the first piece Video Woman I destroy live mum say I love she you know she not even my real mum my real mum and dad dump I and fuck off back to Nigeria the devil be in I Court Court Sleep Woman have you ever be

fuckin ass from Hollywood to go and film something real you make person fuckin sleep dream about bullshit applause Newton Aduaka thank you the first clip really be totally try to capture what cinema be for I and where I be come from in term of cinema the first piece be really there be a young woman talk about Nigeria that she have a feeling she will be happy there this be the sentiment of someone that be be away from home and that be something that I go through you know and I be still go through I have not be home for quite a while for about five year now I have be away 20 year in total and so it really it be really how suddenly you know this be make in 1997 which be the time of Abacha the military dictatorship the bad part of Nigerian history this post colonial history so for this girl to have this dream be simply how we preserve a sense of what home be how and it be sort of perhaps romantic but I think beautiful because you just need something to hold on to especially in a society where you feel alienated which take we to the next piece where the young man talk about lack of opportunity living as a black person in Europe the glass ceiling that we all know about that we all talk about and he reality again this be my this be I talk about this be again the time of multiculturalism in the United Kingdom and there be this buzzword and it be try to say what exactly do this multiculturalism mean in the real life of person and what would a child what do a child like Jamie the young boy think I mean with all this anger that be build up inside of he what happen with that what of course happen with that be violence which we see when we talk about the ghetto and we talk about you know South Central L A and this kind of stuff and which eventually when channel become you know evolve and manifest itself as riot like the one in France two year ago where I live which shock everybody because everyone think oh well France be a liberal society but I live in England for 18 year I have live in France for about four and I feel actually throw back 20 year live in France and then the third piece the third piece for I be the question what be cinema to you what do you do with cinema there be a young director Hollywood director with he friend fellow filmmaker talk about what cinema mean I suppose that will take I to my last piece what cinema mean for I my life start as a I start life in 1966 a few month before the Biafran which last for three year and it be three year of war so that whole thing that whole childhood echo and take I into the next piece Video Voice Onicha

thank you just very quickly to say that my point really here be that while we be make all this huge advancement what we be do which for I you know I think we should Africa should move forward but we should remember so we do not go back here again thank you Emeka Okafor thank you Newton applause one of the theme that come through very strongly in the piece we just watch be this sense of the psychological trauma of the young that have to play this role of be child soldier and consider where you be come from and when we consider the extent to which it not take as seriously as it should be what would you have to say about that to in the process of my research I actually spend a bit of time in Sierra Leone research this and I remember I meet a lot of child soldier ex combatant as they like to be call I meet psychosocial worker who work with they I meet psychiatrist who spend time with they aid worker NGOs the whole lot but I remember on the flight back on my last trip I remember break down in tear and think to myself if any kid in the West in the western world go through a day of what any of that kid have go through they will be in therapy for the rest of they natural life so for I the thought that we have all this child it a generation we have a whole generation of child who have be put through so much psychological trauma or damage and Africa have to live with that but I be just say to factor that in factor that in with all this great advancement all this pronouncement of great achievement that really my think eo well we thank you again for come to the TED stage that be a very moving piece to thank you EO thank you applause
