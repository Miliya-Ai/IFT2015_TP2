if you would like to learn how to play the lobster we have some here and that be not a joke we really do so come up afterwards and I will show you how to play a lobster so actually I start work on what be call the mantis shrimp a few year ago because they make sound this be a recording I make of a mantis shrimp that be find off the coast of California and while that be a absolutely fascinating sound it actually turn out to be a very difficult project and while I be struggle to figure out how and why mantis shrimp or stomatopod make sound I start to think about they appendage and mantis shrimp be call mantis shrimp after the pray mantis which also have a fast feeding appendage and I start to think well maybe it will be interesting while listen to they sound to figure out how this animal generate very fast feeding strike and so today I will talk about the extreme stomatopod strike work that I have do in collaboration with Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell so manti shrimp come in two variety there be spearer and smasher and this be a spearing mantis shrimp or stomatopod and he live in the sand and he catch thing that go by overhead so a quick strike like that and if we slow it down a bit this be the mantis shrimp the same species record at 1 000 frame a second play back at 15 frame per second and you can see it be just a really spectacular extension of the limb explode upward to actually just catch a dead piece of shrimp that I have offer it now the other type of mantis shrimp be the smasher stomatopod and this guy open up snail for a live and so this guy get the snail all set up and give it a good whack laughter so I will play it one more time he wiggle it in place tug it with he nose and smash and a few smash later the snail be break open and he be get a good dinner so the smasher raptorial appendage can stab with a point at the end or it can smash with the heel and today I will talk about the smash type of strike and so the first question that come to mind be well how fast do this limb move because it be move pretty darn fast on that video and I immediately come upon a problem every single high speed video system in the biology department at Berkeley be not fast enough to catch this movement we simply could not capture it on video and so this have I stymie for quite a long period of time and then a BBC crew come cruise through the biology department look for a story to do about new technology in biology and so we strike up a deal I say well if you guy rent the high speed video system that could capture this movement you guy can film we collect the datum and believe it or not they go for it laughter so we get this incredible video system it be very new technology it just come out about a year ago that allow you to film at extremely high speed in low light and low light be a critical issue with film animal because if it be too high you fry they laughter so this be a mantis shrimp there be the eye up here and there be that raptorial appendage and there be the heel and that thing be go to swing around and smash the snail and the snail wire to a stick so he be a little bit easy to set up the shot and yeah laughter I hope there be not any snail right activist around here laughter so this be film at 5 000 frame per second and I be play it back at 15 and so this be slow down 333 time and as you will notice it be still pretty gosh darn fast slow down 333 time it be a incredibly powerful movement the whole limb extend out the body flex backwards just a spectacular movement and so what we do be we take a look at this video and we measure how fast the limb be move to get back to that original question and we be in for we first surprise so what we calculate be that the limb be move at the peak speed range from 10 meter per second all the way up to 23 meter per second and for that of you who prefer mile per hour that be over 45 mile per hour in water and this be really darn fast in fact it be so fast we be able to add a new point on the extreme animal movement spectrum and mantis shrimp be officially the fast measure feed strike of any animal system so we first surprise applause so that be really cool and very unexpected so you might be wonder well how do they do it and actually this work be do in the 1960 by a famous biologist name Malcolm Burrows and what he show in mantis shrimp be that they use what be call a catch mechanism or click mechanism and what this basically consist of be a large muscle that take a good long time to contract and a latch that prevent anything from move so the muscle contract and nothing happen and once the muscle contract completely everything store up the latch fly upward and you have get the movement and that be basically what be call a power amplification system it take a long time for the muscle to contract and a very short time for the limb to fly out and so I think that this be sort of the end of the story this be how mantis shrimp make this very fast strike but then I take a trip to the National Museum of Natural History and if any of you ever have a chance backstage of the National Museum of Natural History be one of the world good collection of preserve mantis shrimp and what laughter this be serious business for I laughter so this what I see on every single mantis shrimp limb whether it be a spearer or a smasher be a beautiful saddle shape structure right on the top surface of the limb and you can see it right here it just look like a saddle you would put on a horse it be a very beautiful structure and it be surround by membranous area and that membranous area suggest to I that maybe this be some kind of dynamically flexible structure and this really sort of have I scratch my head for a while and then we do a series of calculation and what we be able to show be that this mantis shrimp have to have a spring there need to be some kind of spring load mechanism in order to generate the amount of force that we observe and the speed that we observe and the output of the system so we think ok this must be a spring the saddle could very well be a spring and we go back to that high speed video again and we could actually visualize the saddle compress and extend and I will just do that one more time and then if you take a look at the video it be a little bit hard to see it be outline in yellow the saddle be outline in yellow you can actually see it extend over the course of the strike and actually hyperextend so we have have very solid evidence show that that saddle shape structure actually compress and extend and do in fact function as a spring the saddle shape structure be also know as a hyperbolic paraboloid surface or a anticlastic surface and this be very well know to engineer and architect because it be a very strong surface in compression it have curve in two direction one curve upward and opposite transverse curve down the other so any kind of perturbation spread the force over the surface of this type of shape so it be very well know to engineer not as well know to biologist it be also know to quite a few person who make jewelry because it require very little material to build this type of surface and it be very strong so if you be go to build a thin gold structure it be very nice to have it in a shape that be strong now it be also know to architect one of the most famous architect be Eduardo Catalano who popularize this structure and what be show here be a saddle shape roof that he build that be 87 and a half foot spanwise it be two and a half inch thick and support at two point and one of the reason why he design roof this way be because it be he find it fascinating that you could build such a strong structure that be make of so few material and can be support by so few point and all of this be the same principle that apply to the saddle shape spring in stomatopod in biological system it be important not to have a whole lot of extra material requirement for build it so very interesting parallel between the biological and the engineering world and interestingly this turn out the stomatopod saddle turn out to be the first describe biological hyperbolic paraboloid spring that be a bit long but it be sort of interesting so the next and final question be well how much force do a mantis shrimp produce if they be able to break open snail and so I wire up what be call a load cell a load cell measure force and this be actually a piezoelectronic load cell that have a little crystal in it and when this crystal be squeeze the electrical property change and it which in proportion to the force that go in so this animal be wonderfully aggressive and be really hungry all the time and so all I have to do be actually put a little shrimp paste on the front of the load cell and they would smash away at it and so this be just a regular video of the animal just smash the heck out of this load cell and we be able to get some force measurement out and again we be in for a surprise I purchase a 100 pound load cell think no animal could produce more than 100 pound at this size of a animal and what do you know they immediately overload the load cell so this be actually some old datum where I have to find the small animal in the lab and we be able to measure force of well over 100 pound generate by a animal about this big and actually just last week I get a 300 pound load cell up and run and I have clock this animal generate well over 200 pound of force and again I think this will be a world record I have to do a little bit more background reading but I think this will be the large amount of force produce by a animal of a give per body mass so really incredible force and again that bring we back to the importance of that spring in store up and release so much energy in this system but that be not the end of the story now thing I be make this sound very easy this be actually a lot of work and I get all this force measurement and then I go and look at the force output of the system and this be just very simple time be on the x axis and the force be on the y axis and you can see two peak and that be what really get I puzzle the first peak obviously be the limb hit the load cell but there be a really large second peak half a millisecond later and I do not know what that be so now you would expect a second peak for other reason but not half a millisecond later again go back to that high speed video there be a pretty good hint of what might be go on here be that same orientation that we see early there be that raptorial appendage there be the heel and it be go to swing around and hit the load cell and what I would like you to do in this shot be keep you eye on this on the surface of the load cell as the limb come fly through and I hope what you be able to see be actually a flash of light audience wow Sheila Patek and so if we just take that one frame what you can actually see there at the end of that yellow arrow be a vapor bubble and what that be be cavitation and cavitation be a extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon which occur when you have area of water move at extremely different speed and when this happen it can cause area of very low pressure which result in the water literally vaporize and when that vapor bubble collapse it emit sound light and heat and it be a very destructive process and so here it be in the stomatopod and again this be a situation where engineer be very familiar with this phenomenon because it destroy boat propeller person have be struggle for year to try and design a very fast rotate boat propeller that do not cavitate and literally wear away the metal and put hole in it just like this picture show so this be a potent force in fluid system and just to sort of take it one step far I be go to show you the mantis shrimp approach the snail this be take at 20 000 frame per second and I have to give full credit to the BBC cameraman Tim Green for set this shoot up because I could never have do this in a million year one of the benefit of work with professional cameraman you can see it come in and a incredible flash of light and all this cavitation spread over the surface of the snail so really just a amazing image slow down extremely to extremely slow speed and again we can see it in slightly different form there with the bubble form and collapse between that two surface in fact you might have even see some cavitation go up the edge of the limb so to solve this quandary of the two force peak what I think be go on be that first impact be actually the limb hit the load cell and the second impact be actually the collapse of the cavitation bubble and this animal may very well be make use of not only the force and the energy store with that specialized spring but the extreme of the fluid dynamics and they might actually be make use of fluid dynamics as a second force for break the snail so really fascinating double whammy so to speak from this animal so one question I often get after this talk so I figure I would answer it now be well what happen to the animal because obviously if it be break snail the poor limb must be disintegrate and indeed it do that be the smash part of the heel on both this image and it get wear away in fact I have see they wear away they heel all the way to the flesh but one of the convenient thing about be a arthropod be that you have to molt and every three month or so this animal molt and they build a new limb and it be no problem very very convenient solution to that particular problem so I would like to end on sort of a wacky note laughter maybe this be all wacky to folk like you I do not know laughter so the saddle that saddle shape spring have actually be well know to biologist for a long time not as a spring but as a visual signal and there be actually a spectacular colored dot in the center of the saddle of many species of stomatopod and this be quite interesting to find evolutionary origin of visual signal on what be really in all species they spring and I think one explanation for this could be go back to the molting phenomenon so this animal go into a molting period where they be unable to strike they body become very soft and they be literally unable to strike or they will self destruct this be for real and what they do be up until that time period when they can not strike they become really obnoxious and awful and they strike everything in sight it do not matter who or what and the second they get into that time point when they can not strike any more they just signal they wave they leg around and it be one of the classic example in animal behavior of bluff it be a well establish fact of this animal that they actually bluff they can not actually strike but they pretend to and so I be very curious about whether that color dot in the center of the saddle be convey some kind of information about they ability to strike or they strike force and something about the time period in the molting cycle so sort of a interesting strange fact to find a visual structure right in the middle of they spring so to conclude I mostly want to acknowledge my two collaborator Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell who work closely with I on this and also the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science which give I three year of funding to just do science all the time and for that I be very grateful thank you very much applause
