when I be President of the American Psychological Association they try to media train I and a encounter I have with CNN summarize what I be go to be talk about today which be the eleventh reason to be optimistic the editor of Discover tell we 10 of they I be go to give you the eleventh so they come to I CNN and they say Professor Seligman would you tell we about the state of psychology today we would like to interview you about that and I say great and she say but this be CNN so you only get a sound bite I say well how many word do I get and she say well one laughter and the camera roll and she say Professor Seligman what be the state of psychology today good laughter cut cut that will not do we would really better give you a long sound bite how many word do I get this time well you get two laughter doctor Seligman what be the state of psychology today not good laughter look Doctor Seligman we can see you be really not comfortable in this medium we have good give you a real sound bite this time you can have three word Professor Seligman what be the state of psychology today not good enough that be what I be go to be talk about I want to say why psychology be good why it be not good and how it may become in the next 10 year good enough and by parallel summary I want to say the same thing about technology about entertainment and design because I think the issue be very similar so why be psychology good well for more than 60 year psychology work within the disease model ten year ago when I be on a airplane and I introduce myself to my seatmate and tell they what I do they would move away from I because quite rightly they be say psychology be about find what be wrong with you Spot the loony and now when I tell person what I do they move toward I what be good about psychology about the 30 billion investment NIMH make about work in the disease model about what you mean by psychology be that 60 year ago none of the disorder be treatable it be entirely smoke and mirror and now 14 of the disorder be treatable two of they actually curable and the other thing that happen be that a science develop a science of mental illness we find out we could take fuzzy concept like depression alcoholism and measure they with rigor that we could create a classification of the mental illness that we could understand the causality of the mental illness we could look across time at the same person person for example who be genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia and ask what the contribution of mothering of genetics be and we could isolate third variable by do experiment on the mental illness and good of all we be able in the last 50 year to invent drug treatment and psychological treatment and then we be able to test they rigorously in random assignment placebo control design throw out the thing that do not work keep the thing that actively do the conclusion of that be psychology and psychiatry of the last 60 year can actually claim that we can make miserable person less miserable and I think that be terrific I be proud of it but what be not good the consequence of that be three thing the first be moral that psychologist and psychiatrist become victimologist pathologizer that we view of human nature be that if you be in trouble brick fall on you and we forget that person make choice and decision we forget responsibility that be the first cost the second cost be that we forget about you person we forget about improve normal life we forget about a mission to make relatively untroubled person happy more fulfil more productive and genius high talent become a dirty word no one work on that and the third problem about the disease model be in we rush to do something about person in trouble in we rush to do something about repair damage it never occur to we to develop intervention to make person happy positive intervention so that be not good and so that be what lead person like Nancy Etcoff Dan Gilbert Mike Csikszentmihalyi and myself to work in something I call positive psychology which have three aim the first be that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it be with weakness it should be just as concern with building strength as with repair damage it should be interested in the good thing in life and it should be just as concerned with make the life of normal person fulfil and with genius with nurture high talent so in the last 10 year and the hope for the future we have see the beginning of a science of positive psychology a science of what make life worth live it turn out that we can measure different form of happiness and any of you for free can go to that website www authentichappiness org and take the entire panoply of test of happiness you can ask how do you stack up for positive emotion for mean for flow against literally ten of thousand of other person we create the opposite of the diagnostic manual of the insanity a classification of the strength and virtue that look at the sex ratio how they be define how to diagnose they what build they and what get in they way we find that we could discover the causation of the positive state the relationship between left hemispheric activity and right hemispheric activity as a cause of happiness I have spend my life work on extremely miserable person and I have ask the question how do extremely miserable person differ from the rest of you and start about six year ago we ask about extremely happy person how do they differ from the rest of we it turn out there be one way very surprising they be not more religious they be not in good shape they do not have more money they be not good look they do not have more good event and few bad event the one way in which they differ they be extremely social they do not sit in seminar on Saturday morning laughter they do not spend time alone each of they be in a romantic relationship and each have a rich repertoire of friend but watch out here this be merely correlational datum not causal and it be about happiness in the first Hollywood sense I be go to talk about happiness of ebullience and giggling and good cheer and I be go to suggest to you that be not nearly enough in just a moment we find we could begin to look at intervention over the century from the Buddha to Tony Robbins about 120 intervention have be propose that allegedly make person happy and we find that we have be able to manualize many of they and we actually carry out random assignment efficacy and effectiveness study that be which one actually make person lastingly happy in a couple of minute I will tell you about some of that result but the upshot of this be that the mission I want psychology to have in addition to its mission of cure the mentally ill and in addition to its mission of make miserable person less miserable be can psychology actually make person happy and to ask that question happy be not a word I use very much we have have to break it down into what I think be askable about happy and I believe there be three different I call they different because different intervention build they it be possible to have one rather than the other three different happy life the first happy life be the pleasant life this be a life in which you have as much positive emotion as you possibly can and the skill to amplify it the second be a life of engagement a life in you work you parenting you love you leisure time stop for you that be what Aristotle be talk about and third the meaningful life I want to say a little bit about each of that life and what we know about they the first life be the pleasant life and it be simply as good we can find it it be have as many of the pleasure as you can as much positive emotion as you can and learn the skill savor mindfulness that amplify they that stretch they over time and space but the pleasant life have three drawback and it be why positive psychology be not happy ology and why it do not end here the first drawback be it turn out the pleasant life you experience of positive emotion be about 50 percent heritable and in fact not very modifiable so the different trick that Matthieu and I and other know about increase the amount of positive emotion in you life be 15 to 20 percent trick get more of it second be that positive emotion habituate it habituate rapidly indeed it be all like French vanilla ice cream the first taste be 100 percent by the time you be down to the sixth taste it be go and as I say it be not particularly malleable and this lead to the second life I have to tell you about my friend Len to talk about why positive psychology be more than positive emotion more than build pleasure in two of the three great arena of life by the time Len be 30 Len be enormously successful the first arena be work by the time he be 20 he be a option trader by the time he be 25 he be a multimillionaire and the head of a option trading company second in play he be a national champion bridge player but in the third great arena of life love Len be a abysmal failure and the reason he be be that Len be a cold fish laughter Len be a introvert American woman say to Len when he date they you be no fun you do not have positive emotion get lose and Len be wealthy enough to be able to afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst who for five year try to find the sexual trauma that have somehow lock positive emotion inside of he but it turn out there be not any sexual trauma it turn out that Len grow up in Long Island and he play football and watch football and play bridge Len be in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivity the question be be Len unhappy and I want to say not contrary to what psychology tell we about the bottom 50 percent of the human race in positive affectivity I think Len be one of the happy person I know he be not consign to the hell of unhappiness and that be because Len like most of you be enormously capable of flow when he walk onto the floor of the American Exchange at 9 30 in the morning time stop for he and it stop till the close bell when the first card be play till 10 day later when the tournament be over time stop for Len and this be indeed what Mike Csikszentmihalyi have be talk about about flow and it be distinct from pleasure in a very important way pleasure have raw feel you know it be happen it be think and feel but what Mike tell you yesterday during flow you can not feel anything you be one with the music Time stop you have intense concentration and this be indeed the characteristic of what we think of as the good life and we think there be a recipe for it and it be know what you high strength be again there be a valid test of what you five high strength be and then be craft you life to use they as much as you possibly can re craft you work you love you play you friendship you parenting just one example one person I work with be a bagger at Genuardi hate the job she be work she way through college she high strength be social intelligence so she re craft bagging to make the encounter with she the social highlight of every customer day now obviously she fail but what she do be to take she high strength and re craft work to use they as much as possible what you get out of that be not smiley ness you do not look like Debbie Reynolds you do not giggle a lot what you get be more absorption so that be the second path the first path positive emotion the second path be eudaemonian flow and the third path be mean this be the most venerable of the happiness traditionally and mean in this view consist of very parallel to eudaemonia it consist of know what you high strength be and use they to belong to and in the service of something large than you be I mention that for all three kind of life the pleasant life the good life the meaningful life person be now hard at work on the question be there thing that lastingly change that life and the answer seem to be yes and I will just give you some sample of it it be be do in a rigorous manner it be be do in the same way that we test drug to see what really work so we do random assignment placebo control long term study of different intervention just to sample the kind of intervention that we find have a effect when we teach person about the pleasant life how to have more pleasure in you life one of you assignment be to take the mindfulness skill the savor skill and you be assign to design a beautiful day Next Saturday set a day aside design yourself a beautiful day and use savor and mindfulness to enhance that pleasure and we can show in that way that the pleasant life be enhance Gratitude visit I want you all to do this with I now if you would close you eye I would like you to remember someone who do something enormously important that change you life in a good direction and who you never properly thank the person have to be alive now ok you can open you eye I hope all of you have such a person you assignment when you be learn the gratitude visit be to write a 300 word testimonial to that person call they on the phone in Phoenix ask if you can visit do not tell they why show up at they door you read the testimonial everyone weep when this happen and what happen be when we test person one week later a month late three month later they be both happy and less depressed another example be a strength date in which we get couple to identify they high strength on the strength test and then to design a evening in which they both use they strength we find this be a strengthener of relationship and fun versus philanthropy it be so heartening to be in a group like this in which so many of you have turn you life to philanthropy well my undergraduate and the person I work with have not discover this so we actually have person do something altruistic and do something fun and contrast it and what you find be when you do something fun it have a square wave walk set when you do something philanthropic to help another person it last and it last so that be example of positive intervention so the next to last thing I want to say be we be interested in how much life satisfaction person have this be really what you be about and that be we target variable and we ask the question as a function of the three different life how much life satisfaction do you get so we ask and we have do this in 15 replication involve thousand of person to what extent do the pursuit of pleasure the pursuit of positive emotion the pleasant life the pursuit of engagement time stop for you and the pursuit of mean contribute to life satisfaction and we result surprise we they be backward of what we think it turn out the pursuit of pleasure have almost no contribution to life satisfaction the pursuit of meaning be the strong the pursuit of engagement be also very strong where pleasure matter be if you have both engagement and you have mean then pleasure the whip cream and the cherry which be to say the full life the sum be great than the part if you have get all three conversely if you have none of the three the empty life the sum be less than the part and what we be ask now be do the very same relationship physical health morbidity how long you live and productivity follow the same relationship that be in a corporation be productivity a function of positive emotion engagement and meaning be health a function of positive engagement of pleasure and of mean in life and there be reason to think the answer to both of that may well be yes so Chris say that the last speaker have a chance to try to integrate what he hear and so this be amazing for I I have never be in a gathering like this I have never see speaker stretch beyond themselves so much which be one of the remarkable thing but I find that the problem of psychology seem to be parallel to the problem of technology entertainment and design in the follow way we all know that technology entertainment and design have be and can be use for destructive purpose we also know that technology entertainment and design can be use to relieve misery and by the way the distinction between relieve misery and building happiness be extremely important I think when I first become a therapist 30 year ago that if I be good enough to make someone not depress not anxious not angry that I would make they happy and I never find that I find the good you could ever do be to get to zero that they be empty and it turn out the skill of happiness the skill of the pleasant life the skill of engagement the skill of meaning be different from the skill of relieve misery and so the parallel thing hold with technology entertainment and design I believe that be it be possible for this three driver of we world to increase happiness to increase positive emotion and that be typically how they have be use but once you fractionate happiness the way I do not just positive emotion that be not nearly enough there be flow in life and there be mean in life as Laura Lee tell we design and I believe entertainment and technology can be use to increase mean engagement in life as well so in conclusion the eleventh reason for optimism in addition to the space elevator be that I think with technology entertainment and design we can actually increase the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet and if technology can in the next decade or two increase the pleasant life the good life and the meaningful life it will be good enough if entertainment can be divert to also increase positive emotion mean eudaemonia it will be good enough and if design can increase positive emotion eudaemonia and flow and mean what we be all do together will become good enough thank you applause
