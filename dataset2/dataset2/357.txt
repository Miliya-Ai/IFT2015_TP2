many of you could ask the question you know why be a fly car or maybe more accurately a roadable aircraft possible at this time a number of year ago Mr Ford predict that fly car of some form would be available now 60 year later I be here to tell you why it be possible when I be about five year old not very much about a year after Mr Ford make he prediction I be live in a rural part of Canada on the side of a mountain in a very isolated area get to school for a kid that be actually pretty short for he age through the Canadian winter be not a pleasant experience it be a try and scary thing for a young kid to be go through at the end of my first year in school in the summer of that year I discover a couple hummingbird that be catch in a shed near my home they have wear themselves out beat themselves against the window and well they be easy to capture I take they outside and as I let they go that split second even though they be very tired that second I let they go they hover for a second then zipped off into the distance I think what a great way to get to school laughter for a kid at that age this be like infinite speed disappear and I be very inspire by that and so the next over the next six decade believe it or not I have build a number of aircraft with the goal of create something that could do for you or I what the hummingbird do and give you that flexibility I have call this vehicle generically a volantor after the latin word volant meaning to fly in a light nimble manner Volantor like helicopter perhaps the FAA the control body above all call it a powered lift aircraft and they have actually issue a pilot license a powerlift pilot license for this type of aircraft it be close than you think it be kind of remarkable when you consider that there be no operational powered lift aircraft so for once perhaps the government be ahead of itself the press call my particular volantor a Skycar this be a little bit early version of it that be why it be give the x designation but it be a four passenger aircraft that could take off vertically like a helicopter therefore it do not need a airfield on the ground it be power electrically it be actually classify as a motorcycle because of the three wheel which be a great asset because it allow you theoretically to use this on the highway in most state and actually in all city so that be a asset because if you have get to deal with the crash protection issue of the automobile forget it you be never go to fly it laughter one could say that a helicopter do pretty much what the hummingbird do and get around in much the same way and it be true but a helicopter be a very complex device it be expensive so expensive that very few person could own or use it it be often be describe because of its fragile nature and its complexity as a series of part a large number of part fly in formation laughter another difference and I have to describe this because it be very personal another great difference between the helicopter and the volantor in my case the Skycar volantor be the experience that I have have in fly both of that in a helicopter you feel and it be still a remarkable sensation you feel like you be be haul up from above by a vibrate crane when you get in the Skycar and I can tell you there be only one other person that be fly it but he have the same sensation you really feel like you be be lift up by a magic carpet without any vibration whatsoever the sensation be unbelievable and it be be a great motivator I only get to fly this vehicle occasionally and only when I can persuade my stockholder to let I do so but it be still one of that wonderful experience that reward you for all that time what we really need be something to replace the automobile for that 50 plus mile trip very few person realize that 50 mile plus trip make up 85 percent of the mile travel in America if we can get rid of that then the highway will now be useful to you as contrast by what be happen in many part of the world today on this next slide be a interesting history of what we really have see in infrastructure because whether I give you a perfect Skycar the perfect vehicle for use it be go to have very little value to you unless you have get a system to use it in I be sure any of you have ask the question yeah be there great thing up there what be I go to do get up there it be bad enough on a highway what be it go to be like to be in the air this world that you be go to be talk about tomorrow be go to be completely integrate you be not go to be a pilot you be go to be a passenger and it be the infrastructure that really determine whether this process go forward I can tell you technically we can build Skycars my God we go to the moon the technology there be much more difficult than what I be deal with here but we have to have this priority change we have to have infrastructure to go with this historically you see that we get around 200 year ago by canal and as that system disappear be replace by railroad as that disappear we come in with highway but if you look at that top corner the highway system you see where we be today highway be no long be build and that be a fact you will not see any additional highway in the next 10 year however the next 10 year if like the last 10 year we be go to see 30 percent more traffic and where be that go to lead you to so the issue then I have often ask be when be it go to happen when be we go to be able to have this vehicle and of course if you ask I I be go to give you a really optimistic view after all I have be spend 60 year here believe it be go to happen tomorrow so I be not go to quote myself on this I have prefer to quote someone else who testify with I before Congress and in he position as head of NASA put forward this particular vision of the future of this type of aircraft now I would argue actually if you look at the fact that on the highway today you be only average about 30 mile per hour on average accord to the DOT the Skycar travels at over 300 mile a hour up to 25 000 foot and so in effect you could see perhaps a tenfold increase in the ability to get around as far as speed be concerned Unbeknownst to many of you the highway in the sky that I be talk about here have be under construction for 10 year it make use of the GPS you be familiar with gps in you automobile but you may not be familiar with the fact that there be a gps u s there be a Russian gps and there be a new gps system go to Europe call Galileo with that three system you have what be always necessary a level of redundancy that say if one system fail you will still have a way to make sure that you be be control because if you be in this world where computer be control what you be do it be go to be very critical that something can not fail on you how would a trip in a Skycar work well you can not right now take off from you home because it be too noisy I mean to be able to take off from you home you would have to be extremely quiet but it be still fairly quiet you have motor electrically to a vertiport which may be a few block maybe even a few mile away this be clearly as I say early a roadable aircraft and you be not go to spend that much time on the road after all if you can fly like that why be you go to drive around on a highway go to a local vertiport plug in you destination deliver almost like a passenger you can play computer game you can sleep you can read on the way this be the world there will not be you as a pilot and I know the pilot in the audience be not go to like that and I have have a lot of bad feedback from person who want to be up there fly around and experience that and of course I suppose like recreational park you can still do that but the vehicle itself be go to be a very very controlled environment or it be go to have no use to you as a person who might use such a system we fly the first vehicle for the international press in 1965 when I really get it start I be a professor at the U C Davis System and I get a lot of excitement around this and I be able to fund the initiation of the program back in that time and then through the various year we invent various vehicle actually the critical point be in 1989 when we demonstrate the stability of this vehicle how completely stable it be in all circumstance which be of course very critical still not a practical vehicle during all of this but move in the right direction we believe finally in the early part of or actually the middle of 2002 we fly the 400 m400 which be the four passenger vehicle in this case here we be fly it remotely as we always do at the beginning and we have very small power plant in it at this time we be now install large powerplant which will make it possible for I to get back on board a vertical takeoff aircraft be not the safe vehicle during the test flight program there be a old adage that apply for the year between 1950 and 1970 when every aeronautical company be work on vertical takeoff aircraft a vertical takeoff aircraft need a artificial stabilization system that be essential at least for the hover and the low speed flight if that single stability system that brain that fly that aircraft fail or if the engine fail that vehicle crash there be no option to that and the adage that I be refer to that apply at that time be that nothing come down fast than a vtol aircraft upside down laughter that be a macabre comment because we lose a lot of pilot in fact the aircraft company give up on vertical takeoff aircraft more or less for a number of year and there be really only one operational aircraft in the world today that be a vertical takeoff aircraft as distinct from a helicopter and that be the Hawker Harrier jump jet a vertical takeoff aircraft like the hummingbird have a very high metabolism which mean it require a lot of energy get that energy be very very difficult it all come down to that power plant how to get a large amount of power in a small package fortunately Dr Felix Wankel invent the rotary engine a very unique engine it be round it be small it be vibration free it fit exactly where we need to fit it right in the center of the hub of the duct in the system very critical in fact that engine for that who be into the automobile know that it recently be apply to the rx8 the Mazda and that sportscar win Sports car of the Year wonderful engine in that application it generate one horsepower per pound which be twice as good as you car engine today but only half of what we need my company have spend 35 year and many million of dollar take that rotary engine which be invent in the late 50 and get it to the point that we get over two horsepower per pound reliably and critical we actually get 175 horsepower into one cubic foot we have eight engine in this vehicle we have four computer we have two parachute redundancy be the critical issue here if you want to stay alive you have get to have backup and we have actually fly this vehicle and lose a engine and continue to hover the computer back up each other there be a voting system if one computer be not agree with the other three it be kick out of the system and then you have three you still have the triple redundancy if one of that fail you still have a second chance if you stick around then good luck there will not be a third chance the parachute be there hopefully more for psychological than real reason but they will be a ultimate backup if it come to that laughter I would like to show you a animation in this next one which be one element of the Skycar use but it be one that demonstrate how it could be use you could think of it personally in you own term of how you might use it Video Skycar dispatch launch rescue vehicle for San Francisco Paul Moller I believe that personal transportation in something like the Skycar probably in another volantor form as well will be a significant part of we life as Dr Goldin say within the next 10 year and it be go to change the demographic in a very significant way if you can live 75 mile from San Francisco and get there in 15 minute you be go to sell you 700 000 dollar apartment buy a upscale home on the side of a mountain buy a Skycar which I think would be price at that time perhaps in the area of 100 000 dollar put money in the bank that be a very significant incentive for get out of San Francisco but you well be the first one out of town as the real estate value go to hell laughter develop the Skycar have be a real challenge obviously I be dependent on a lot of other person believe in what I be do both financially and in technical help and that have you run into situation where you have this great acceptance of what you be do and a lot of rejection of the same kind of thing I characterize this emerge technology in a aphorism as it be describe which really talk about what I have experience and I be sure what other person may have experience in emerge technology there be a interesting poll that come out recently under NAS I think it be MSNBC in which they ask the question be you in the market for a volantor twenty three percent say yes as soon as possible forty seven percent yes as soon as they could price could come down twenty three percent say as soon as it be prove safe only seven percent say that they would not consider buy a Skycar I be encourage by that at least it make I feel like to some extent it be become self evident that we need a alternative to the automobile at least for that 50 mile trip and more so that the highway become usable in today world thank you
