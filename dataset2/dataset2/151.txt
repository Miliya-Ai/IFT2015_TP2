well as Chris point out I study the human brain the function and structure of the human brain and I just want you to think for a minute about what this entail here be this mass of jelly three pound mass of jelly you can hold in the palm of you hand and it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space it can contemplate the meaning of infinity and it can contemplate itself contemplate on the meaning of infinity and this peculiar recursive quality that we call self awareness which I think be the holy grail of neuroscience of neurology and hopefully someday we will understand how that happen ok so how do you study this mysterious organ I mean you have 100 billion nerve cell little wisp of protoplasm interact with each other and from this activity emerge the whole spectrum of ability that we call human nature and human consciousness how do this happen well there be many way of approach the function of the human brain one approach the one we use mainly be to look at patient with sustained damage to a small region of the brain where there be be a genetic change in a small region of the brain what then happen be not a across the board reduction in all you mental capacity a sort of blunt of you cognitive ability what you get be a highly selective loss of one function with other function be preserve intact and this give you some confidence in assert that that part of the brain be somehow involve in mediate that function so you can then map function onto structure and then find out what the circuitry do to generate that particular function so that be what we be try to do so let I give you a few striking example of this in fact I be give you three example six minute each during this talk the first example be a extraordinary syndrome call Capgras syndrome if you look at the first slide there that be the temporal lobe frontal lobe parietal lobe ok the lobe that constitute the brain and if you look tuck away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobe you can not see it there be a little structure call the fusiform gyrus and that be be call the face area in the brain because when it be damage you can no longer recognize person face you can still recognize they from they voice and say oh yeah that be Joe but you can not look at they face and know who it be right you can not even recognize yourself in the mirror I mean you know it be you because you wink and it wink and you know it be a mirror but you do not really recognize yourself as yourself ok now that syndrome be well know as cause by damage to the fusiform gyrus but there be another rare syndrome so rare in fact that very few physician have hear about it not even neurologist this be call the Capgras delusion and that be a patient who be otherwise completely normal have have a head injury come out of coma otherwise completely normal he look at he mother and say this look exactly like my mother this woman but she be a impostor she be some other woman pretend to be my mother now why do this happen why would somebody and this person be perfectly lucid and intelligent in all other respects but when he see he mother he delusion kick in and say it be not mother now the most common interpretation of this which you find in all the psychiatry textbook be a Freudian view and that be that this chap and the same argument apply to woman by the way but I will just talk about guy when you be a little baby a young baby you have a strong sexual attraction to you mother this be the so call Oedipus complex of Freud I be not say I believe this but this be the standard Freudian view and then as you grow up the cortex develop and inhibit this latent sexual urge towards you mother thank God or you would all be sexually arouse when you see you mother and then what happen be there be a blow to you head damage the cortex allow this latent sexual urge to emerge flame to the surface and suddenly and inexplicably you find yourself be sexually arouse by you mother and you say my God if this be my mom how come I be be sexually turn on she be some other woman she be a impostor it be the only interpretation that make sense to you damage brain this have never make much sense to I this argument it be very ingenious as all Freudian argument be laughter but do not make much sense because I have see the same delusion a patient have the same delusion about he pet poodle laughter he will say Doctor this be not fifi it look exactly like Fifi but it be some other dog right now you try use the Freudian explanation there laughter you will start talk about the latent bestiality in all human or some such thing which be quite absurd of course now what be really go on so to explain this curious disorder we look at the structure and function of the normal visual pathway in the brain normally visual signal come in into the eyeball go to the visual area in the brain there be in fact 30 area in the back of you brain concern with just vision and after process all that the message go to a small structure call the fusiform gyrus where you perceive face there be neuron there that be sensitive to face you can call it the face area of the brain right I talk about that early now when that area damage you lose the ability to see face right but from that area the message cascade into a structure call the amygdala in the limbic system the emotional core of the brain and that structure call the amygdala gauge the emotional significance of what you be look at be it prey be it predator be it mate or be it something absolutely trivial like a piece of lint or a piece of chalk or a I do not want to point to that but or a shoe or something like that ok which you can completely ignore so if the amygdala be excited and this be something important the message then cascade into the autonomic nervous system you heart start beat fast you start sweat to dissipate the heat that you be go to create from muscular exertion and that be fortunate because we can put two electrode on you palm and measure the change in skin resistance produce by sweat so I can determine when you be look at something whether you be excited or whether you be arouse or not ok and I will get to that in a minute so my idea be when this chap look at a object when he look at he any object for that matter it go to the visual area and however and it be process in the fusiform gyrus and you recognize it as a pea plant or a table or you mother for that matter ok and then the message cascade into the amygdala and then go down the autonomic nervous system but maybe in this chap that wire that go from the amygdala to the limbic system the emotional core of the brain be cut by the accident so because the fusiform be intact the chap can still recognize he mother and say oh yeah this look like my mother but because the wire be cut to the emotional center he say but how come if it be my mother I do not experience a warmth or terror as the case may be right laughter and therefore he say how do I account for this inexplicable lack of emotion this can not be my mother it be some strange woman pretend to be my mother how do you test this well what you do be if you take any one of you here and put you in front of a screen and measure you galvanic skin response and show picture on the screen I can measure how you sweat when you see a object like a table or a umbrella of course you do not sweat if I show you a picture of a lion or a tiger or a pinup you start sweat right and believe it or not if I show you a picture of you mother I be talk about normal person you start sweat you do not even have to be Jewish laughter now what happen if you show this patient you take the patient and show he picture on the screen and measure he galvanic skin response table and chair and lint nothing happen as in normal person but when you show he a picture of he mother the galvanic skin response be flat there be no emotional reaction to he mother because that wire go from the visual area to the emotional center be cut so he vision be normal because the visual area be normal he emotion be normal he will laugh he will cry so on and so forth but the wire from vision to emotion be cut and therefore he have this delusion that he mother be a impostor it be a lovely example of the sort of thing we do take a bizarre seemingly incomprehensible neural psychiatric syndrome and say that the standard Freudian view be wrong that in fact you can come up with a precise explanation in term of the know neural anatomy of the brain by the way if this patient then go and mother phone from a adjacent room phone he and he pick up the phone and he say wow mom how be you where be you there be no delusion through the phone then she approach he after a hour he say who be you you look just like my mother ok the reason be there be a separate pathway go from the hearing center in the brain to the emotional center and that be not be cut by the accident so this explain why through the phone he recognize he mother no problem when he see she in person he say it be a impostor ok how be all this complex circuitry set up in the brain be it nature gene or be it nurture and we approach this problem by consider another curious syndrome call phantom limb and you all know what a phantom limb be when a arm be amputate or a leg be amputate for gangrene or you lose it in war for example in the Iraq war it be now a serious problem you continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing arm and that be call a phantom arm or a phantom leg in fact you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body believe it or not even with internal viscera I have have patient with the uterus remove hysterectomy who have a phantom uterus include phantom menstrual cramp at the appropriate time of the month and in fact one student ask I the other day do they get phantom pms laughter a subject ripe for scientific enquiry but we have not pursue that ok now the next question be what can you learn about phantom limb by do experiment one of the thing we have find be about half the patient with phantom limb claim that they can move the phantom it will pat he brother on the shoulder it will answer the phone when it ring it will wave goodbye this be very compelling vivid sensation the patient be not delusional he know that the arm be not there but nevertheless it be a compelling sensory experience for the patient but however about half the patient this do not happen the phantom limb they will say but doctor the phantom limb be paralyzed it be fix in a clench spasm and it be excruciatingly painful if only I could move it maybe the pain will be relieve now why would a phantom limb be paralyze it sound like a oxymoron but when we be look at the case sheet what we find be this person with the paralyzed phantom limb the original arm be paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury the actual nerve supply the arm be sever be cut by say a motorcycle accident so the patient have a actual arm which be painful in a sling for a few month or a year and then in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm the surgeon amputate the arm and then you get a phantom arm with the same pain right and this be a serious clinical problem patient become depressed some of they be drive to suicide ok so how do you treat this syndrome now why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb when I look at the case sheet I find that they have a actual arm and the nerve supply the arm have be cut and the actual arm have be paralyze and lie in a sling for several month before the amputation and this pain then get carry over into the phantom itself why do this happen when the arm be intact but paralyzed the brain send command to the arm the front of the brain say move but it be get visual feedback say no move no move no move no and this get wire into the circuitry of the brain and we call this learn paralysis ok the brain learn because of this hebbian associative link that the mere command to move the arm create a sensation of a paralyzed arm and then when you have amputate the arm this learn paralysis carry over into you body image and into you phantom ok now how do you help this patient how do you unlearn the learn paralysis so you can relieve he of this excruciating clenching spasm of the phantom arm well we say what if you now send the command to the phantom but give he visual feedback that it be obey he command right maybe you can relieve the phantom pain the phantom cramp how do you do that well virtual reality but that cost million of dollar so I hit on a way of do this for three dollar but do not tell my funding agency laughter ok what you do be you create what I call a mirror box you have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle and then you put the phantom so my first patient Derek come in he have he arm amputate 10 year ago he have a brachial avulsion so the nerve be cut and the arm be paralyzed lie in a sling for a year and then the arm be amputate he have a phantom arm excruciatingly painful and he could not move it it be a paralyzed phantom arm so he come there and I give he a mirror like that in a box which I call a mirror box right and the patient put he phantom leave arm which be clench and in spasm on the left side of the mirror and the normal hand on the right side of the mirror and make the same posture the clench posture and look inside the mirror and what do he experience he look at the phantom be resurrect because he be look at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror and it look like this phantom have be resurrect now I say now look wiggle you phantom you real finger or move you real finger while look in the mirror he be go to get the visual impression that the phantom be move right that be obvious but the astonishing thing be the patient then say oh my God my phantom be move again and the pain the clench spasm be relieved and remember my first patient who come in applause thank you applause my first patient come in and he look in the mirror and I say look at you reflection of you phantom and he start giggle he say I can see my phantom but he be not stupid he know it be not real he know it be a mirror reflection but it be a vivid sensory experience now I say move you normal hand and phantom he say oh I can not move my phantom you know that it be painful I say move you normal hand and he say oh my God my phantom be move again I do not believe this and my pain be be relieve ok and then I say close you eye he close he eye and move you normal hand oh nothing it be clench again ok open you eye oh my God oh my god it be move again so he be like a kid in a candy store so I say ok this prove my theory about learn paralysis and the critical role of visual input but I be not go to get a Nobel Prize for get somebody to move he phantom limb laughter applause it be a completely useless ability if you think about it laughter but then I start realize maybe other kind of paralysis that you see in neurology like stroke focal dystonia there may be a learn component to this which you can overcome with the simple device of use a mirror so I say look Derek well first of all the guy can not just go around carry a mirror to alleviate he pain I say look Derek take it home and practice with it for a week or two maybe after a period of practice you can dispense with the mirror unlearn the paralysis and start move you paralyzed arm and then relieve yourself of pain so he say ok and he take it home I say look it be after all two dollar take it home so he take it home and after two week he phone I and he say Doctor you be not go to believe this I say what he say it be go I say what be go I think maybe the mirror box be go laughter he say no no no you know this phantom I have have for the last 10 year it be disappear and I say I get worried I say my God I mean I have change this guy body image what about human subject ethic and all of that and I say Derek do this bother you he say no last three day I have not have a phantom arm and therefore no phantom elbow pain no clench no phantom forearm pain all that pain be go away but the problem be I still have my phantom finger dangle from the shoulder and you box do not reach laughter so can you change the design and put it on my forehead so I can you know do this and eliminate my phantom finger he think I be some kind of magician now why do this happen it be because the brain be face with tremendous sensory conflict it be get message from vision say the phantom be back on the other hand there be no proprioception muscle signal say that there be no arm right and you motor command say there be a arm and because of this conflict the brain say to hell with it there be no phantom there be no arm right it go into a sort of denial it gate the signal and when the arm disappear the bonus be the pain disappear because you can not have disembody pain float out there in space so that be the bonus now this technique have be try on dozen of patient by other group in Helsinki so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain and indeed person have try it for stroke rehabilitation stroke you normally think of as damage to the fiber nothing you can do about it but it turn out some component of stroke paralysis be also learn paralysis and maybe that component can be overcome use mirror this have also go through clinical trial help lot and lot of patient ok let I switch gear now to the third part of my talk which be about another curious phenomenon call synesthesia this be discover by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century he be a cousin of Charles Darwin he point out that certain person in the population who be otherwise completely normal have the follow peculiarity every time they see a number it be color five be blue seven be yellow eight be chartreuse nine be indigo ok bear in mind this person be completely normal in other respects or c sharp sometimes tone evoke color c sharp be blue f sharp be green another tone might be yellow right why do this happen this be call synesthesia Galton call it synesthesia a mingling of the sens in we all the sens be distinct this person muddle up they sens why do this happen one of the two aspect of this problem be very intriguing Synesthesia run in family so Galton say this be a hereditary basis a genetic basis secondly synesthesia be about and this be what get I to my point about the main theme of this lecture which be about creativity synesthesia be eight time more common among artist poet novelist and other creative person than in the general population why would that be I be go to answer that question it be never be answer before ok what be synesthesia what cause it well there be many theory one theory be they be just crazy now that be not really a scientific theory so we can forget about it another theory be they be acid junkie and pothead right now there may be some truth to this because it be much more common here in the Bay Area than in San Diego laughter ok now the third theory be that well let ask ourselves what be really go on in synesthesia all right so we find that the color area and the number area be right next to each other in the brain in the fusiform gyrus so we say there be some accidental cross wiring between color and number in the brain so every time you see a number you see a correspond color and that be why you get synesthesium now remember why do this happen why would there be cross wire in some person remember I say it run in family that give you the clue and that be there be a abnormal gene a mutation in the gene that cause this abnormal cross wiring in all of we it turn out we be bear with everything wire to everything else so every brain region be wire to every other region and this be trim down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain so if there be a gene cause this trimming and if that gene mutate then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain area and if it be between number and color you get number color synesthesia if it be between tone and color you get tone color synesthesia so far so good now what if this gene be express everywhere in the brain so everything be cross connected well think about what artist novelist and poet have in common the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking link seemingly unrelated idea such as it be the east and Juliet be the Sun well you do not say Juliet be the sun do that mean she be a glow ball of fire I mean schizophrenic do that but it be a different story right normal person say she be warm like the sun she be radiant like the sun she be nurture like the sun instantly you have find the link now if you assume that this great cross wiring and concept be also in different part of the brain then it be go to create a great propensity towards metaphorical thinking and creativity in person with synesthesia and hence the eight time more common incidence of synesthesia among poet artist and novelist ok it be a very phrenological view of synesthesia the last demonstration can I take one minute applause ok I be go to show you that you be all synesthete but you be in denial about it here be what I call Martian alphabet just like you alphabet a be a b be B C be C different shape for different phoneme right here you have get Martian alphabet one of they be Kiki one of they be Bouba which one be Kiki and which one be Bouba how many of you think that be Kiki and that be Bouba raise you hand well it be one or two mutant laughter how many of you think that be Bouba that be Kiki raise you hand ninety nine percent of you now none of you be a Martian how do you do that it be because you be all do a cross model synesthetic abstraction mean you be say that that sharp inflection ki ki in you auditory cortex the hair cell be excited Kiki mimic the visual inflection sudden inflection of that jagged shape now this be very important because what it be tell you be you brain be engage in a primitive it be just it look like a silly illusion but this photon in you eye be do this shape and hair cell in you ear be exciting the auditory pattern but the brain be able to extract the common denominator it be a primitive form of abstraction and we now know this happen in the fusiform gyrus of the brain because when that be damage this person lose the ability to engage in Bouba Kiki but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor if you ask this guy what all that glitter be not gold what do that mean the patient say well if it be metallic and shiny it do not mean it be gold you have to measure its specific gravity ok so they completely miss the metaphorical meaning so this area be about eight time the size in high especially in human as in low primate something very interesting be go on here in the angular gyrus because it be the crossroads between hearing vision and touch and it become enormous in human and something very interesting be go on and I think it be a basis of many uniquely human ability like abstraction metaphor and creativity all of this question that philosopher have be study for millennia we scientist can begin to explore by do brain imaging and by study patient and ask the right question thank you applause sorry about that laughter
