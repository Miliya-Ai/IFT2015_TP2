I be go to give you four specific example I be go to cover at the end about how a company call Silk triple they sale how a artist name Jeff Koons go from be a nobody to make a whole bunch of money and have a lot of impact to how Frank Gehry redefine what it mean to be a architect and one of my big failure as a marketer in the last few year a record label I start that have a cd call Sauce before I can do that I have get to tell you about sliced bread and a guy name Otto Rohwedder now before slice bread be invent in the 1910 I wonder what they say like the great invention since the telegraph or something but this guy name Otto Rohwedder invent slice bread and he focus like most inventor do on the patent part and the make part and the thing about the invention of slice bread be this that for the first 15 year after sliced bread be available no one buy it no one know about it it be a complete and total failure and the reason be that until wonder come along and figure out how to spread the idea of slice bread no one want it that the success of slice bread like the success of almost everything we have talk about at this conference be not always about what the patent be like or what the factory be like it be about can you get you idea to spread or not and I think that the way you be go to get what you want or cause the change that you want to change to happen be to figure out a way to get you idea to spread and it do not matter to I whether you be run a coffee shop or you be a intellectual or you be in business or you be fly hot air balloon I think that all this stuff apply to everybody regardless of what we do that what we be live in be a century of idea diffusion that person who can spread idea regardless of what that idea be win when I talk about it I usually pick business because they make the good picture that you can put in you presentation and because it be the easy sort of way to keep score but I want you to forgive I when I use this example because I be talk about anything that you decide to spend you time to do at the heart of spread idea be tv and stuff like tv tv and mass media make it really easy to spread idea in a certain way I call it the tv industrial complex the way the tv industrial complex work be you buy some ad interrupt some person that get you distribution you use the distribution you get to sell more product you take the profit from that to buy more ad and it go around and around and around the same way that the military industrial complex work a long time ago that model of and we hear it yesterday if we could only get onto the homepage of Google if we could only figure out how to get promote there or grab that person by the throat and tell they about what we want to do if we do that then everyone would pay attention and we would win well this tv industrial complex inform my entire childhood and probably yours I mean all of this product succeed because someone figure out how to touch person in a way they be not expect in a way they do not necessarily want with a ad over and over again until they buy it and the thing that be happen be they cancel the tv industrial complex that just over the last few year what anybody who market anything have discover be that it be not work the way that it use to this picture be really fuzzy I apologize I have a bad cold when I take it laughter but the product in the blue box in the center be my poster child I go to the deli I be sick I need to buy some medicine the brand manager for that blue product spend 100 million dollar try to interrupt I in one year 100 million dollar interrupt I with tv commercial and magazine ad and spam and coupon and shelve allowance and spiff all so I could ignore every single message and I ignore every message because I do not have a pain reliever problem I buy the stuff in the yellow box because I always have and I be not go to invest a minute of my time to solve she problem because I do not care here be a magazine call hydrate it be 180 page about water laughter article about water ad about water imagine what the world be like 40 year ago with just the Saturday Evening Post and Time and Newsweek now there be magazine about water new product from Coke Japan water salad laughter Coke Japan come out with a new product every three week because they have no idea what be go to work and what be not I could not have write this good myself it come out four day ago I circle the important part so you can see they here they have come out arby be go to spend 85 million dollar promote a oven mitt with the voice of Tom Arnold hope that that will get person to go to Arby and buy a roast beef sandwich laughter now I have try to imagine what could possibly be in a animated tv commercial feature Tom Arnold that would get you to get in you car drive across town and buy a roast beef sandwich laughter now this be Copernicus and he be right when he be talk to anyone who need to hear you idea the world revolve around I I I I I my favorite person I I do not want to get email from anybody I want to get memail laughter so consumer and I do not just mean person who buy stuff at the Safeway I mean person at the Defense Department who might buy something or person at you know the New Yorker who might print you article consumer do not care about you at all they just do not care part of the reason be they have get way more choice than they use to and way less time and in a world where we have too many choice and too little time the obvious thing to do be just ignore stuff and my parable here be you be drive down the road and you see a cow and you keep drive because you have see cow before cow be invisible cow be bore who be go to stop and pull over and say oh look a cow nobody laughter but if the cow be purple be not that a great special effect I could do that again if you want if the cow be purple you would notice it for a while I mean if all cow be purple you would get bored with that too the thing that be go to decide what get talk about what get do what get change what get purchase what get build be be it remarkable and remarkable be a really cool word because we think it just mean neat but it also mean worth make a remark about and that be the essence of where idea diffusion be go that two of the hot car in the United States be a 55 000 dollar giant car big enough to hold a Mini in its trunk person be pay full price for both and the only thing they have in common be that they do not have anything in common laughter every week the number one good selling dvd in America change it be never the Godfather it be never Citizen Kane it be always some third rate movie with some second rate star but the reason it be number one be because that be the week it come out because it be new because it be fresh person see it and say I do not know that be there and they notice it two of the big success story of the last 20 year in retail one sell thing that be super expensive in a blue box and one sell thing that be as cheap as they can make they the only thing they have in common be that they be different we be now in the fashion business no matter what we do for a living we be in the fashion business and person in the fashion business know what it be like to be in the fashion business they be use to it the rest of we have to figure out how to think that way how to understand that it be not about interrupt person with big full page ad or insist on meeting with person but it be a totally different sort of process that determine which idea spread and which one do not they sell a billion dollar worth of Aeron chair by reinvent what it mean to sell a chair they turn a chair from something the purchasing department buy to something that be a status symbol about where you sit at work this guy Lionel Poil ne the most famous baker in the world he die two and a half month ago and he be a hero of mine and a dear friend he live in Paris last year he sell 10 million dollar worth of French bread every loaf bake in a bakery he own by one baker at a time in a wood fire oven and when Lionel start he bakery the French pooh pooh ed it they do not want to buy he bread it do not look like French bread it be not what they expect it be neat it be remarkable and slowly it spread from one person to another person until finally it become the official bread of three star restaurant in Paris now he be in London and he ship by fedex all around the world what marketer use to do be make average product for average person that be what mass marketing be smooth out the edge go for the center that be the big market they would ignore the geek and God forbid the laggard it be all about go for the center but in a world where the tv industrial complex be break I do not think that be a strategy we want to use any more I think the strategy we want to use be to not market to this person because they be really good at ignore you but market to this person because they care this be the person who be obsess with something and when you talk to they they will listen because they like listen it be about they and if you be lucky they will tell they friend on the rest of the curve and it will spread it will spread to the entire curve they have something I call otaku it be a great Japanese word it describe the desire of someone who be obsess to say drive across Tokyo to try a new ramen noodle place because that be what they do they get obsess with it to make a product to market a idea to come up with any problem you want to solve that do not have a constituency with a otaku be almost impossible instead you have to find a group that really desperately care about what it be you have to say talk to they and make it easy for they to tell they friend there be a hot sauce otaku but there be no mustard otaku that be why there be lot and lot of kind of hot sauce and not so many kind of mustard not because it be hard to make interesting mustard you could make interesting mustard but person do not because no one obsess with it and thus no one tell they friend krispy kreme have figure this whole thing out it have a strategy and what they do be they enter a city they talk to the person with the otaku and then they spread through the city to the person who have just cross the street this yoyo right here cost 112 dollar but it sleep for 12 minute not everybody want it but they do not care they want to talk to the person who do and maybe it will spread this guy make the loud car stereo in the world laughter it be as loud as a 747 jet you can not get in the car be get bulletproof glass because it will blow out the windshield otherwise but the fact remain that when someone want to put a couple of speaker in they car if they have get the otaku or they have hear from someone who do they go ahead and they pick this it be really simple you sell to the person who be listen and just maybe that person tell they friend so when Steve Jobs talk to 50 000 person at he keynote who be all tune in from 130 country watch he two hour commercial that be the only thing keep he company in business it be that that 50 000 person care desperately enough to watch a two hour commercial and then tell they friend Pearl Jam 96 album release in the last two year every one make a profit how they only sell they on they website that person who buy they have the otaku and then they tell they friend and it spread and it spread this hospital crib cost 10 000 dollar 10 time the standard but hospital be buy it fast than any other model hard candy nail Polish do not appeal to everybody but to the person who love it they talk about it like crazy this paint can right here save the dutch boy paint company make they a fortune it cost 35 percent more than regular paint because Dutch Boy make a can that person talk about because it be remarkable they do not just slap a new ad on the product they change what it mean to build a paint product amihotornot com everyday 250 000 person go to this site run by two volunteer and I can tell you they be hard grader laughter they do not get this way by advertise a lot they get this way by be remarkable sometimes a little too remarkable and this picture frame have a cord go out the back and you plug it into the wall my father have this on he desk and he see he grandchild everyday change constantly and every single person who walk into he office hear the whole story of how this thing end up on he desk and one person at a time the idea spread this be not diamond not really they be make from cremain after you be cremate you can have yourself make into a gem laughter oh you like my ring it be my grandmother laughter fast grow business in the whole mortuary industry but you do not have to be Ozzie Osborne you do not have to be super outrageous to do this what you have to do be figure out what person really want and give it to they a couple of quick rule to wrap up the first one be design be free when you get to scale the person who come up with stuff that be remarkable more often than not figure out how to put design to work for they number two the risky thing you can do now be be safe Proctor and Gamble know this right the whole model of be Proctor and Gamble be always about average product for average person that be risky the safe thing to do now be to be at the fringe be remarkable and be very good be one of the bad thing you can possibly do very good be bear very good be average it do not matter whether you be make a record album or you be a architect or you have a tract on sociology if it be very good it be not go to work because no one be go to notice it so my three story Silk put a product that do not need to be in the refrigerated section next to the milk in the refrigerated section sale triple why milk milk milk milk milk not milk for the person who be there and look at that section it be remarkable they do not triple they sale with advertising they triple it by do something remarkable that be a remarkable piece of art you do not have to like it but a 40 foot tall dog make out of bush in the middle of New York City be remarkable laughter Frank Gehry do not just change a museum he change a entire city economy by design one building that person from all over the world go to see now at countless meeting at you know the Portland City Council or who know where they say we need a architect can we get Frank Gehry because he do something that be at the fringe and my big failure I come out with a entire music a record album and hopefully a whole bunch of record album in sacd this remarkable new format and I market it straight to person with 20 000 dollar stereo person with 20 000 dollar stereo do not like new music laughter so what you need to do be figure out who do care who be go to raise they hand and say I want to hear what you be do next and sell something to they the last example I want to give you this be a map of Soap Lake Washington as you can see if that be nowhere it be in the middle of it laughter but they do have a lake and person use to come from mile around to swim in the lake they do not anymore so the find father say we have get some money to spend what can we build here and like most committee they be go to build something pretty safe and then a artist come to they this be a true artist render he want to build a 55 foot tall lava lamp in the center of town that be a purple cow that be something worth notice I do not know about you but if they build it that be where I be go to go thank you very much for you attention
