I be the weekly tech critic for the New York Times I review gadget and stuff and mostly what good dad should be do this time of year be nestle with they kid and decorate the Christmas tree what I be mostly do this year be go on cable tv and answer the same question what be the tech trend for next year and I be like do not we just go through this last year but I be go to pick the one that interest I most and that be the complete marriage of the cell phone and the Internet you know I find that volcano on Google image not realize how much it make I look like the cover of Dianetics laughter anyway this all start a few year ago when they start carry you voice over the internet rather than over a phone line and we have come a long way since that but that be interesting in itself this be company like Vonage basically you take a ordinary telephone you plug it into this little box that they give you and the box plug into you cable modem now it work just like a regular phone so you can pick up the phone you hear a dial tone but its just a fake out it be a wav file of a dial tone just to reassure you that the world have not end it could be anything it could be salsa music or a comedy routine it do not matter the little box have you phone number so that be really cool you can take it to London or Siberia and you next door neighbor can dial you home number and you phone will ring because it be get everything in the box they have get every feature know to man in there because add a new feature be just software and as a result of Voice over IP I hate that term Voice over Internet land line home phone service have go down 30 percent in the last three year I mean no self respect college kid have home phone service anymore this be what college kid be more likely to have it be the most popular voip service in the world it be Skype it be a free program you download for you Mac or PC and you make free phone call anywhere in the world the downside be that you have to wear a headset like a nerd it be not you phone it be you computer but nonetheless if you be a college kid and you have no money believe I this be good than try to use you cell phone it be really cute see middle aged person like I try out Skype for the first time which be usually when they kid go away for a semester abroad they do not want to pay the international fee so they be like Timmy be that you laughter it be really cute but I at least it be when I do it laughter I think where voip be really go to get interesting be when they start put it on cell phone imagine if you have a ordinary cell phone and any time you be in a wireless hotspot free call anywhere in the world never pay the cellular company a nickel it would be really really cool and yet even though the technology for this have be available for five year incredibly the number of standard cell phone offer by US carrier with free voip be zero I can not figure out why laughter actually I need to update that there be one now and it be so interesting that I think I would tell you about it it come from T Mobile and I be not pay by T Mobile I be not plug T Mobile the New York Times have very rigid policy about that ever since that Jayson Blair jerk ruin it for all of we laughter basically the reason you have not hear about this program be because it be introduce last year on June 29 do anyone remember what else happen on June 29 last year it be the iPhone the iPhone come out that day I be like can you imagine be the T Mobile PR lady you know hi we have a announcement to wah laughter but it be actually really really cool you have a choice of phone and we be not talk smartphone ordinary phone include a blackberry that have Wi Fi the deal be any time you be in a Wi Fi hotspot all you call be free and when you be out of the hotspot you be on the regular cellular network you be think well how often be I in a hotspot the answer be all the time because they give you a regular wireless router that work with the phone for you house which be really ingenious because we all know that T Mobile be the most pathetic carrier they have coverage like the size of my thumbnail laughter but it be a hundred million dollar to put up one of that tower right they do not have that kind of money instead they give each of we a seven dollar and 95 cent box they be like a stealth tower installation program we be put it in we home for they anyway they have Wi Fi phone in Europe but the thing that T Mobile do that nobody be do before be when you be on a call a you move from Wi Fi into cellular range the call be hand off in mid syllable seamlessly I will show you the advanced technology we use at the New York Times to test this gear this be I with a camcorder on a phone go like this laughter as I walk out of the house from my Wi Fi hotspot into the cellular network on a call with my wife look at the upper left that be the Wi Fi signal video Jennifer Pogue Hello David Pogue hi babe it be I JP oh hi darling how be you DP you be on Wi Fi how do it sound JP oh it sound pretty good now I be leave the house DP I be go for a walk do you mind JP No not at all I be have a great day with the kid DP what be you guy do right there it just change to the cellular tower in mid call I do not know why my wife say I never listen to she I do not get that laughter the bottom line be that the boundary because of the internet plus cell phone be melt the cool thing about the T Mobile phone be that although switch technology be very advanced the billing technology have not catch up so what I mean be that you can start a call in you house in the Wi Fi hotspot you can get in you car and talk until the battery dead which would be like 10 minute laughter and the call will continue to be free because they do not they have not well no wait not so fast it also work the other way so if you start a call on you cellular network and you come home you keep be bill which be why most person with this service get into the habit of say hey I just get home can I call you right back now you get it it be also true that if you use one of this phone overseas it do not know what internet hotspot you be in on the internet nobody know you be a dog right nobody know you be in Pakistan you can make free unlimited call home to the US with this phone so very very interesting this be another favorite of mine do anyone here have a work cell phone that be on with coverage who can make a call right now without a lot of fuss ok would you call I please right now phone number give and do not you all call I at three a m ask I to fix you printer laughter I have two cell phone so this go to be very odd if it work I should know not to do technology demo in front of a audience it be just like absurd this one be go off and oh I have the ringer off Tsh Great anyway this one be also go off so they be both ring at the same time excuse I one second hello oh where be you call from no no just kid there he be thank you very much for do that I do not even know it be you I be look at this guy oh great yeah yeah you can all stop call now laughter all right we have make the point all right Ringer off everyone want in on the action laughter so this be Grand Central at work it be a oh for god sake laughter I have you number now laughter you will pay Grand Central be this really brilliant idea where they give you a new phone number and then at that point one phone number ring all you phone at once you home phone you work phone you cell phone you yacht phone this be the EG crowd laughter the beauty of that be you never miss a call I know a lot of you be like Ooh I do not want to be reach at any hour but the beauty be it be all go through the internet so you get all of this really cool feature like you can say I want this person to be able to call I only during this hour and I want this person to hear this greeting hi boss I be out make we both some money leave a message and then you wife call and hi honey leave I a message very very customizable Google buy it and they have be work on it for a year they be suppose to come out with it very shortly in a public method by the way this be something that really bother I I do not know if you realize this when you call 411 on you cell phone they charge you two buck do you know that it be a outrage I actually get a photograph of the Verizon employee right there I be go to tell you how to avoid that now what you be go to use be Google Cellular it be totally free there be not even ad if you know how to send a text message you can get the same information for free I be about to change you life so here be I do it you send a text message to the word Google which turn out to be 46645 leave off the last e for savings anyway so let say you need a drugstore near Chicago you type pharmacy Chicago or the zip code you hit send and in five second they will send you back the two close drugstore complete with name address and phone number here it come and it be already write down so like if you be drive you do not have to do one of this thing uh huh uh huh uh huh it work with weather too you can say Weather and the name of the city you be go to travel to and then in five second they send you back the complete weather forecast for that town shortly I will tell you why I be in Milan here we go and that be just the beginning this be all the different thing that you can text to Google and they will yeah you be all try to write this down that be cute I do have a email address you can just ask I it be absolutely phenomenal the only downside be that it require you to know how to text send a text message nobody over 40 know how to do that so I be go to teach you something even well this be call Google Info they have just launch this voice activate version of the same thing it be speech recognition like you have never hear before so let say I be in Monterey and I want what I want to find what bagel ok Google say the business and the city and state DP Bagels Monterey California I get the Chinese line laughter Google Bagels Monterey California Top eight result number one Bagel Bakery on El Dorado Street to select number one you can press one or say number one number two Bagel Bakery commissary department number two number two two laughter why do I listen to person in the audience well anyway oh here we go Google commissary department on McClellan Avenue Monterey I will connect you or say detail or go back DP he be connect I he do not even tell I the phone number he be just connect I directly it be like have a personal valet Google hold on laughter DP Hi could I have 400 with a schmear no no no just kid no no so anyway you never even find out the number it be just so amazing and it have incredible incredible accuracy this be even more amazing put this in you speed dial this you can ask by voice any question who win the 1958 World Series what be the recipe for a certain cocktail it be absolutely amazing and they text you back the answer I try this this morning just to make sure it be still alive which actor have play James Bond they text I back this Sean Connery George Lazenby Roger Moore Timothy Dalton Pierce Brosnan Daniel Craig Right and then I be try to pretend I be like a Valley girl I be like what be the word that mean you know like when the sun the moon and the earth be like all in a line just to see how the recognition be they text I back it be call a syzygy which I know because it be the word that win I the Ohio spelling bee in 1976 you know there be a lot of person wonder how on earth be they go to make money do this and the answer be look at the last line they put this teeny weeny little ad about 10 character long and a lot of person also want to know how do it work how can it be so good it be as though there be a human being on the other end of the line because there be one they have 10 000 person who be be pay 20 cent per answer as you can imagine it be college kid and old person that be who can afford to do that but it be a human being on the line and it be get I out of so many tough position like when the last flight out of Chicago you know it be just absolutely amazing another thing that really bother I about cell phone today this be probably my big pet peeve in all of technology when I call to leave you a message I get 15 second of instruction from a third grade teacher on ambien laughter to page this person page what be this 1975 nobody have pager anymore you may begin speak at the tone when you have finish record you may hang up no laughter and then it get bad when I call to retrieve my message first of all you have 87 message to listen to you message why else be I call laughter of course I want to listen to the message laughter oh you all have cell phone too so last year I go to Milan Italy and I get to speak to a audience of cellular executive from 200 country around the world and I say as a joke as a joke I say I do the math Verizon have 70 million customer if you check you voicemail twice a day that be 100 million dollar a year I bet you guy be do this just to run up we airtime be not you no chuckle they be like this laughter where be the outrage person rise up laughter sorry I be not bitter laughter so now I be go to tell you how to get out of that there be this service that transcribe you voicemail into text and they send it either to you email or as text message to you phone it be a life changer and by the way they do not always get the word right because it be over the phone and all that so they attach the audio file at the bottom of the email so you can listen to double check the service be call thing like Spinvox Phonetag this be the one I use Callwave A lot of person say how be they do this I do not really want person listen in to my call the executive at this company tell I well we use a proprietary b to B good of breed peer to peer solutus you know I think basically it be like this guy in India with headset you know listen in the reason I think that be that on the first day I try one of this service I get two voicemail message one be from a guy name Michael Stevenson which should not be that hard to transcribe and it be misspell the other be from my video producer at the Times whose name be Vijaiy Singh with the silent h nail that one laughter so you be the judge laughter anyway this service callwave promise that it be all software nobody be listen to you message and they also promise that they be go to transcribe only the gist of you message laughter so I think I would see how that go this be I test it out Video hello this be Michael hope you be do well I be fine here everything be good hey I be walk along the street and the sky be blue and you daughter break she leg at soccer practice I be go to have a sandwich for lunch she be in room emergency room 53w ok talk to you later bye laughter I love my job laughter so a couple minute later this I get by email it be a very good transcription but a couple minute after that I get the text message version now remember a text message can only be 160 character long so it have good be the gist of the gist right I be not kid you the message say be walk along the street and sky be blue and emergency laughter what the f laughter well I guess that be the gist laughter and lastly I just have to talk about this one this be my favorite of all time it be call Popularitydialer com basically you be go to go on some iffy date or a potentially bad meeting so you go and you type in you phone number and at the exact minute where you want to be call laughter and at that moment you phone will ring and you be like I be sorry I have get to take this the really beautiful thing be you know how when somebody be sit next to you sometimes they can sort of hear a little bit of the caller so they give you a choice of what you want to hear on the other end here be the girlfriend phone hey you what be go on DP I be kinda like give a talk right now phone well that be good DP what be you do phone I be just wonder what you be up to DP Right I can not really talk right now this be the i love this the boss call phone hey this be Mr Johnson call from the office DP oh hi sir phone do you complete that thing about a month ago that photocopier training DP oh sorry I forget phone yeah well so when be the last time you use the photocopier dp it be like three week ago phone well I do not know if you hear you might have hear from Lenny but laughter I think the big change when Internet meet phone be with the iPhone not my fine moment in New York Times journalism it be when in the fall of 2006 I explain why Apple would never do a cell phone laughter I look like a moron however my logic be good because I do not know if you realize this but until the iPhone come along the carrier Verizon AT T Cingular hold veto power over every aspect of every design of every phone I know the person who work on the Treo they go around to this carrier and say look at this cool feature and Verizon be like hmm no I do not think so it be not very conducive to innovation what I do not anticipate be that Steve Jobs go around and say tell you what I will give you a five year exclusive if you will let I design this phone in peace and you will not even see it till it be do actually even so he be turn down by Verizon and other finally Cingular say ok I be go to talk about the effect of the iPhone please do not corner I at the party tonight and go what be you a Apple fan boy you know I be not you can see what I say about it it be a flawed masterpiece it be get bad thing and good thing let all acknowledge that right now but it do change a few thing the first thing it change be that all that carrier see that they sell 10 million of this thing in a year and they say oh my gosh maybe we have be do it wrong maybe we should let phone designer design the phone applause another thing be that it let 10 million person for the first time experience be online all the time not use this 60 dollar a month cellular card for they laptop I do not understand why we be not there yet when I be a old man I be go to tell my grandchild when I be you age if I want to check my email I use to drive around town look for a coffee shop I do laughter we have wireless base station that could broadcast yay about 150 foot across laughter it be absurd we have power outlet in every room of every building we have run water what be the problem anyway but this teach person what it be like you have to go to YouTube and type in iPhone Shuffle this guy do a mock video of one that be one inch square like the real ipod shuffle it be like it only have one button touch it and it dial a number at random laughter who the hell be this laughter but the other thing it do be it open up this idea of a app store it download right to the phone and you can use the tilt sensor to steer this car use this game this program can use all the component of the iPhone the touch screen this be the etch a sketch program the theme of EG 2008 you know how you erase it of course you shake it right of course we shake it to erase like this they have 10 000 of this program this be the translator program they have every language in the world you type in what you want and it give you the translation this be amazing this be Midomi A song be run through you head you sing it into the thing do do do do do da da da da da da da dum ok you tap do and it will find out the song and play it for you I know it be insane right this be Pandora Free Internet radio not just free internet radio you type in a band or a song name it will immediately play you that song or that band it have a thumb up and a thumb down you say if you like this song or not if you like it it try another song on you from a different band with the same instrumentation vocal theme and tempo if you like that one or do not like it you do thumb up and thumb down over time it tailor the song so that it completely stop play bad song it eventually only play song you like this be Urbanspoon you be in a city it know from GPS where you be stand you want to find a place to eat you shake it it propose a restaurant it give you the price and the location and rating video I be not go all the way to Flushing anyway just amazing amazing thing of course its not just about the iPhone the iPhone break the dyke the wall but now it be everybody else so Google have do they own android operating system that will soon be on handset phone from 34 company touch screen very very nice also with its own app store where you can download program this be amazing in the wake of all this Verizon the most calcified corporate conservative carrier of all say you can use any phone you want on we network I love the Wired headline Pigs fly Hell freeze over and Verizon open up its Network No really so everything be change we have enter a new world of innovation where the cell phone become you laptop customize the way you want it every cell phone be unique there be software that you can add on can I do one more one minute song thank you applause just to round it up this be the new Apple Power Music stand it be only three pound or 12 if you install Microsoft Office laughter sorry that be mean this be a song I do for the New York Times website as a music video lady and gentleman for seven blissful hour it be the number one video on YouTube to the tune of my way and now the end be near I be sick to death of this old cell phone bad sound the signal weak the software stink a make in Hell phone I have hear there be something new a million time more rad than my phone I too will join the cult I want a iPhone concern I have a few it be get some flaw we may just face it no key no memory card the battery seal you can not replace it but God this thing be sweet a multitouch ipod Wi Fi phone you have I from hello I want a iPhone I want to touch its precious screen I want to wipe the smudge clean I want my friend to look and drool I want to say look now I be cool I stand in line and I will get mine I want a iPhone for what be a man what have he get if not iPhone then he be get squat it be all the thing a phone should be who care if it be at t I take a stand pay half a grand and I get a iPhone applause thank you thank you very much applause
