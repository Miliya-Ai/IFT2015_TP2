you know one of the intense pleasure of travel and one of the delight of ethnographic research be the opportunity to live amongst that who have not forget the old way who still feel they past in the wind touch it in stone polish by rain taste it in the bitter leaf of plant just to know that Jaguar shaman still journey beyond the Milky Way or the myth of the Inuit elder still resonate with meaning or that in the Himalaya the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma be to really remember the central revelation of anthropology and that be the idea that the world in which we live do not exist in some absolute sense but be just one model of reality the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choice that we lineage make albeit successfully many generation ago and of course we all share the same adaptive imperative we be all bear we all bring we child into the world we go through initiation rite we have to deal with the inexorable separation of death so it should not surprise we that we all sing we all dance we all have art but what be interesting be the unique cadence of the song the rhythm of the dance in every culture and whether it be the Penan in the forest of Borneo or the voodoo acolyte in Haiti or the warrior in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya the Curandero in the mountain of the Andes or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara this be incidentally the fellow that I travel into the desert with a month ago or indeed a yak herder in the slope of Qomolangma Everest the goddess mother of the world all of this people teach we that there be other way of be other way of think other way of orient yourself in the Earth and this be a idea if you think about it can only fill you with hope now together the myriad culture of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelop the planet and be as important to the well be of the planet as indeed be the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere and you might think of this cultural web of life as be a ethnosphere and you might define the ethnosphere as be the sum total of all thought and dream myth idea inspiration intuition bring into be by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness the ethnosphere be humanity great legacy it be the symbol of all that we be and all that we can be as a astonishingly inquisitive species and just as the biosphere have be severely erode so too be the ethnosphere and if anything at a far great rate no biologist for example would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have be or be on the brink of extinction because it simply be not true and yet that the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity scarcely approach what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity and the great indicator of that of course be language loss when each of you in this room be bear there be 6 000 language speak on the planet now a language be not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rule a language be a flash of the human spirit it be a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture come into the material world every language be a old growth forest of the mind a watershed a think a ecosystem of spiritual possibility and of that 6 000 language as we sit here today in Monterey fully half be no long be whisper into the ear of child they be no long be teach to baby which mean effectively unless something change they be already dead what could be more lonely than to be envelop in silence to be the last of you person to speak you language to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestor or anticipate the promise of the child and yet that dreadful fate be indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two week because every two week some eld die and carry with he into the grave the last syllable of a ancient tongue and I know there be some of you who say well would not it be good would not the world be a good place if we all just speak one language and I say Great let make that language Yoruba let make it cantonese let make it Kogi and you will suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak you own language and so what I would like to do with you today be sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere a brief journey through the ethnosphere to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact be be lose now there be many of we who sort of forget that when I say different way of be I really do mean different way of be take for example this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon the person of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they come up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snake now this be a person who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heaven be equate to the canopy of the forest upon which the person depend they have a curious language and marriage rule which be call linguistic exogamy you must marry someone who speak a different language and this be all root in the mythological past yet the curious thing be in this long house where there be six or seven language speak because of intermarriage you never hear anyone practice a language they simply listen and then begin to speak or one of the most fascinating tribe I ever live with the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador a astonishing person first contact peacefully in 1958 in 1957 five missionary attempt contact and make a critical mistake they drop from the air 8 x 10 glossy photograph of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gesture forget that this person of the rainforest have never see anything two dimensional in they life they pick up this photograph from the forest floor try to look behind the face to find the form or the figure find nothing and conclude that this be call card from the devil so they spear the five missionary to death but the Waorani do not just spear outsider they spear each other 54 percent of they mortality be due to they spear each other we trace genealogy back eight generation and we find two instance of natural death and when we pressure the person a little bit about it they admit that one of the fellow have get so old that he die get old so we spear he anyway laughter but at the same time they have a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that be astonishing they hunter could smell animal urine at 40 pace and tell you what species leave it behind in the early 80 I have a really astonishing assignment when I be ask by my professor at Harvard if I be interested in go down to Haiti infiltrate the secret society which be the foundation of Duvalier strength and Tonton Macoutes and secure the poison use to make zombie in order to make sense out of sensation of course I have to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun and Voodoo be not a black magic cult on the contrary it be a complex metaphysical worldview it be interesting if I ask you to name the great religion of the world what would you say Christianity Islam Buddhism Judaism whatever there be always one continent leave out the assumption be that sub Saharan Africa have no religious belief well of course they do and voodoo be simply the distillation of this very profound religious idea that come over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era but what make voodoo so interesting be that it be this living relationship between the living and the dead so the living give birth to the spirit the spirit can be invoke from beneath the Great Water respond to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living so that for that brief shine moment the acolyte become the god that be why the Voodooists like to say that you white person go to church and speak about God we dance in the temple and become God and because you be possess you be take by the spirit how can you be harm so you see this astonishing demonstration voodoo acolyte in a state of trance handle burn ember with impunity a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bear it when catalyze in the state of extreme excitation now of all the people that I have ever be with the most extraordinary be the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia descendant of the ancient Tairona civilization which once carpet the caribbean coastal plain of Colombia in the wake of the conquest this person retreat into a isolate volcanic massif that soar above the caribbean coastal plain in a bloodstained continent this person alone be never conquer by the Spanish to this day they remain rule by a ritual priesthood but the training for the priesthood be rather extraordinary the young acolyte be take away from they family at the age of three and four sequester in a shadowy world of darkness in stone hut at the base of glacier for 18 year two nine year period deliberately choose to mimic the nine month of gestation they spend in they natural mother womb now they be metaphorically in the womb of the great mother and for this entire time they be inculturate into the value of they society value that maintain the proposition that they prayer and they prayer alone maintain the cosmic or we might say the ecological balance and at the end of this amazing initiation one day they be suddenly take out and for the first time in they life at the age of 18 they see a sunrise and in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begin to bathe the slope of the stunningly beautiful landscape suddenly everything they have learn in the abstract be affirm in stunning glory and the priest step back and say you see it be really as I have tell you it be that beautiful it be yours to protect they call themselves the elder brother and they say we who be the young brother be the one responsible for destroy the world now this level of intuition become very important whenever we think of indigenous person and landscape we either invoke Rousseau and the old canard of the noble savage which be a idea racist in its simplicity or alternatively we invoke Thoreau and say this person be close to the Earth than we be well indigenous person be neither sentimental nor weaken by nostalgia there be not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamp of the Asmat or in the chilling wind of Tibet but they have nevertheless through time and ritual forge a traditional mystique of the Earth that be base not on the idea of be self consciously close to it but on a far subtler intuition the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it be breathe into be by human consciousness now what do that mean it mean that a young kid from the Andes who be raise to believe that that mountain be a apu spirit that will direct he or she destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raise to believe that a mountain be a pile of rock ready to be mine whether it be the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore be irrelevant what be interesting be the metaphor that define the relationship between the individual and the natural world I be raise in the forest of British Columbia to believe that forest exist to be cut that make I a different human being than my friend amongst the Kwagiulth who believe that that forest be the abode of Huxwhukw and the crooked beak of Heaven and the cannibal spirit that dwell at the north end of the world spirit they would have to engage during they hamatsa initiation now if you begin to look at the idea that this culture could create different reality you could begin to understand some of they extraordinary discovery take this plant here it be a photograph I take in the Northwest Amazon just last April this be ayahuasca which many of you have hear about the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman repertoire what make ayahuasca fascinating be not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation but the elaboration of it it be make really of two different source on the one hand this woody liana which have in it a series of beta carboline harmine harmaline mildly hallucinogenic to take the vine alone be rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across you consciousness but it be mix with the leaf of a shrub in the coffee family call Psychotria viridi this plant have in it some very powerful tryptamine very close to brain serotonin dimethyltryptamine 5 methoxydimethyltryptamine if you have ever see the Yanomami blow that snuff up they nose that substance they make from a different set of species also contain methoxydimethyltryptamine to have that powder blow up you nose be rather like be shoot out of a rifle barrel line with baroque painting and landing on a sea of electricity laughter it do not create the distortion of reality it create the dissolution of reality in fact I use to argue with my professor Richard Evan Shultes who be a man who spark the psychedelic era with he discovery of the magic mushroom in Mexico in the 1930 I use to argue that you could not classify this tryptamine as hallucinogenic because by the time you be under the effect there be no one home anymore to experience a hallucination laughter but the thing about tryptamine be they can not be take orally because they be denature by a enzyme find naturally in the human gut call monoamine oxidase they can only be take orally if take in conjunction with some other chemical that denature the MAO now the fascinating thing be that the beta carboline find within that liana be MAO inhibitor of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine so you ask yourself a question how in a flora of 80 000 species of vascular plant do this person find this two morphologically unrelated plant that when combine in this way create a kind of biochemical version of the whole be great than the sum of the part well we use that great euphemism trial and error which be expose to be meaningless but you ask the Indian and they say the plant talk to we well what do that mean this tribe the Cofan have 17 variety of ayahuasca all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest all of which be referable to we eye as one species and then you ask they how they establish they taxonomy and they say I think you know something about plant I mean do not you know anything and I say no well it turn out you take each of the 17 variety in the night of a full moon and it sing to you in a different key now that be not go to get you a ph d at Harvard but it be a lot more interesting than count stamen laughter now applause the problem the problem be that even that of we sympathetic with the plight of indigenous person view they as quaint and colorful but somehow reduce to the margin of history as the real world mean we world move on well the truth be the 20th century 300 year from now be not go to be remember for its war or its technological innovation but rather as the era in which we stand by and either actively endorse or passively accept the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet now the problem be not change all culture through all time have constantly be engage in a dance with new possibility of life and the problem be not technology itself the Sioux Indian do not stop be Sioux when they give up the bow and arrow any more than a American stop be a American when he give up the horse and buggy it be not change or technology that threaten the integrity of the ethnosphere it be power the crude face of domination wherever you look around the world you discover that this be not culture destine to fade away this be dynamic live people be drive out of existence by identifiable force that be beyond they capacity to adapt to whether it be the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan a nomadic person from Southeast Asia from Sarawak a person who live free in the forest until a generation ago and now have all be reduce to servitude and prostitution on the bank of the river where you can see the river itself be soil with the silt that seem to be carry half of Borneo away to the South China Sea where the Japanese freighter hang light in the horizon ready to fill they hold with raw log rip from the forest or in the case of the Yanomami it be the disease entity that have come in in the wake of the discovery of gold or if we go into the mountain of Tibet where I be do a lot of research recently you will see it be a crude face of political domination you know genocide the physical extinction of a person be universally condemn but ethnocide the destruction of person way of life be not only not condemn it be universally in many quarter celebrate as part of a development strategy and you can not understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level I once travel 6 000 mile from Chengdu in Western China overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa with a young colleague and it be only when I get to Lhasa that I understand the face behind the statistics you hear about 6 000 sacred monument tear apart to dust and ash 1 2 million person kill by the cadre during the Cultural Revolution this young man father have be ascribe to the Panchen Lama that mean he be instantly kill at the time of the Chinese invasion he uncle flee with he holiness in the Diaspora that take the person to Nepal he mother be incarcerate for the crime of be wealthy he be smuggle into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath she skirt tail because she could not bear to be without he the sister who have do that brave deed be put into a education camp one day she inadvertently step on a armband of Mao and for that transgression she be give seven year of hard labor the pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear but the redemptive spirit of the person be something to behold and in the end then it really come down to a choice do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity Margaret Mead the great anthropologist say before she die that she great fear be that as we drift towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduce to a more narrow modality of thought but that we would wake from a dream one day have forget there be even other possibility and it be humbling to remember that we species have perhaps be around for 150 000 year the Neolithic Revolution which give we agriculture at which time we succumb to the cult of the seed the poetry of the shaman be displace by the prose of the priesthood we create hierarchy specialization surplus be only 10 000 year ago the modern industrial world as we know it be barely 300 year old now that shallow history do not suggest to I that we have all the answer for all of the challenge that will confront we in the ensue millennia when this myriad culture of the world be ask the meaning of be human they respond with 10 000 different voice and it be within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of be what we be a fully conscious species fully aware of ensure that all people and all garden find a way to flourish and there be great moment of optimism this be a photograph I take at the northern tip of Baffin Island when I go narwhal hunting with some Inuit person and this man Olayuk tell I a marvelous story of he grandfather the Canadian government have not always be kind to the Inuit person and during the 1950 to establish we sovereignty we force they into settlement this old man grandfather refuse to go the family fearful for he life take away all of he weapon all of he tool now you must understand that the Inuit do not fear the cold they take advantage of it the runner of they sled be originally make of fish wrap in caribou hide so this man grandfather be not intimidate by the Arctic night or the blizzard that be blow he simply slip outside pull down he sealskin trousers and defecate into he hand and as the feces begin to freeze he shape it into the form of a blade he put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally freeze solid he butcher a dog with it he skin the dog and improvise a harness take the ribcage of the dog and improvise a sled harness up a adjacent dog and disappear over the ice flo shit knife in belt talk about get by with nothing laughter and this in many way applause be a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit person and of all indigenous person around the world the Canadian government in April of 1999 give back to total control of the Inuit a area of land large than California and Texas put together it be we new homeland it be call Nunavut it be a independent territory they control all mineral resource a amazing example of how a nation state can seek restitution with its person and finally in the end I think it be pretty obvious at least to all of all we who have travel in this remote reach of the planet to realize that they be not remote at all they be homeland of somebody they represent branch of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time and for all of we the dream of this child like the dream of we own child become part of the naked geography of hope so what we be try to do at the National Geographic finally be we believe that politician will never accomplish anything we think that polemic applause we think that polemic be not persuasive but we think that storytelling can change the world and so we be probably the good storytelling institution in the world we get 35 million hit on we website every month 156 nation carry we television channel we magazine be read by million and what we be do be a series of journey to the ethnosphere where we be go to take we audience to place of such cultural wonder that they can not help but come away dazzle by what they have see and hopefully therefore embrace gradually one by one the central revelation of anthropology that this world deserve to exist in a diverse way that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all people can contribute to we collective well be thank you very much applause
