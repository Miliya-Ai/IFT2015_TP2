I do not know you name Audience Member Howard Howard Thom Mayne Howard I be sit next to Howard I do not know Howard obviously and he be go I hope you be not next laughter amazing amazing performance I kind of erase everything in my brain to follow that let I start some place I be interested I kind of do the same thing but I do not move my body laughter and instead of use human figure to develop idea of time and space I work in the mineral world I work with more or less inert matter and I organize it and well it be also a bit different because a architect versus let say a dance company finally be a negotiation between one private world one conceptual world the world of idea the world of aspiration of invention with the relationship of the exterior world and all the limitation the naysayer because I have to say for my whole career if there be anything that be be consistent it be be that you can not do it no matter what I have do what I have try to do everybody say it can not be do and it be continuous across the complete spectrum of the various kind of reality that you confront with you idea and to be a architect somehow you have to negotiate between left and right and you have to negotiate between this very private place where idea take place and the outside world and then make it understand I can start any number of place because this process be also I think very different from some of the morning session which you have such a kind of very clear such a lineal idea like the last one say with Howard that I think the creative process in architecture the design process be extremely circuitous it be labyrinthine it be Calvino idea of the quick way between two point be the circuitous line not the straight line and definitely my life have be part of that I be go to start with some simple kind of notion of how we organize thing but basically what we do be we try to give coherence to the world we make physical thing building that become a part in a accretional process they make city and that thing be the reflection of the process and the time that they be make and what I be do be attempt to synthesize the way one see the world and the territory which be useful as generative material because really all I be interested in always as a architect be the way thing be produce because that be what I do right and it be not base on a a priori notion I have no interest at all in conceive something in my brain and say this be what it look like in fact somebody mention Ewan maybe it be you in you introduction about this be what architect do somebody say it be what business person come to it be what the corporate world come to when they want to make it look like something at the end of the line huh wow it do not work that way for I at all I have no interest in that whatsoever Architecture be the beginning of something because it be if you be not involve in first principle if you be not involve in the absolute the beginning of that generative process it be cake decoration and I have nothing wrong with cake decoration and cake decorator if anybody involve in cake decoration it be not what I be interested in do laughter and so in the formation of thing in give it form in concretize this thing it start with some notion of how one organize and I have have for 30 year a interest in a series of complexity where a series of force be bring to bear and to understand the nature of the final result of that represent the building itself there be be a continual relationship between invention which be private and reality which have be important to I a project which be part of a exhibition in Copenhagen 10 year ago which be the modeling of a hippocampus the territory of the brain that record short term memory and the documentation of that the imaginative and documentation of that through a series of drawing which literally attempt to organize that experience and it have to do with the notion of walk a kilometer observe every kilometer a particular object of desire and then place that within this and the notion be that I could make a organization not build on normal coherency but build on non sequitur build on randomness and I would be extremely interested in this notion of randomness as it produce architectural work and as it definitely connect to the notion of the city a accretional notion of the city and that lead to various idea of organization and then this lead to broad idea of building that come together through the multiplicity of system and it be not any single system that make the work it be the relationship it be the dynamics between the system which have the power to transform and invent and produce a architecture that be that would otherwise not exist and that system could be identify and they could be group together and of course today with the technology of the computer and with the rapid prototyping etc we have the mechanism to understand and to respond to this system and to allow they to adjust to the various accommodation of functionality because that be all we do we be produce space that accommodate human activity and what I be interested in be not the styling of that but the relationship of that as it enhance that activity and that directly connect to idea of city make this be a project that we just finish in Penang for a very very large city project that come directly out of this process which be the result of the multiplicity of force that produce it and the project again enormous enormous competition on the Hudson River and in New York that we be ask to do three year ago which use this process and what you be look at be possibility that have to do with the generation of the city as one apply a methodology that use notion of this multiple force that deal with the enormity of the problem the complexity of the problem when we be design city at large and large aggregate because one of the issue today be that the economic aggregate be drive the development aggregate and as the aggregate get large we require more and more complex investigation process to solve this problem and that lead we directly to the Olympic Village I be in New York on Monday present it to the IOC we win the competition what be it nine month ago again a direct reflection from use this process to develop extremely complicate very large scale organism and then also be work with broad strategy in this case we only use 15 of the 60 acre of land and the 45 acre be a park and would become the legacy of the Olympic Village and it would become the second large park in the borough etc its position of course in the middle of Manhattan it be on Hunter Point and then the broad idea of city make start have direct influence on architecture on the element that make up the broad scheme the building themselves and start guide we Architecture for I have be a investigation of a multiplicity of force that could come from literally any place and so I can start this discussion in any number of place and I have choose three or four to talk about and it have also to do with a interest in the vast kind of territory that architecture touch it literally be connect to anything in term of knowledge base there be just no place that it do not somehow have a connective tissue to this be Jim Dine and it be the absence of presence etc it be the clothing the skin without the presence of the character it become kind of a idea for the notion of the surface of a work and it be use in a project where we could unravel that surface and it be a figurative idea that be go to be fold and make into a very kind of complex space and the idea be the relationship of the space which be make up of the fold of the image and the dialectic or the conflict between the figuration and the clarity of the image and the complexity of the space which be in dialog and it make we rethink the whole notion of how we work and how we make thing and it lead we to idea that be close to fashion design as we flatten out surface and then bring they back together as they could make spatial combination and this be the first prototype in Korea as we be deal with a dynamic envelope and then the same characteristic of the fabric it have a material identity and it be translucent and it be porous and it allow we for a very different notion of what a skin of a building be and that turn right away into another project this be the Caltrans building in Los Angeles and now we be see as the skin and the body be differentiate again it be a very very simple notion if you look at most building what you look at be the build the facade and it be the building and all of a sudden we be kind of move away and we be separate the skin from the body and that be go to lead to broad performance criterion which I be go to talk about in a minute and you be look at how it drape over and differentiate from the body and then again the building itself middle of Los Angeles right across from City Hall and as it move it take piece of the earth with it it bend up it be part of a sign system which be part of the kind of legacy of Los Angeles the two dimension three dimension signing etc and then it allow one to penetrate the work itself it be transparent and it allow you to understand I think what be always the most interesting thing in any building which be the actual constructional process that make it and it be probably the most intense kind of territory of the work which be not occupy because architecture be always the most interesting in some mechanism when it be separate from function and this be a area that allow for that and then the skin start transform into other material we be use light as a building material in this case we be work with Keith Sonnier in New York and we be make this large outside room which be possible in Los Angeles and which be very much reflective of the urban the contemporary urban environment that you would find in Shibuya or you would find in Mexico City or Sao Paulo etc that have to do with activate the city over a long span of time and that be very much part of the notion of the urban objective of this project in Los Angeles and again all of it promote transparency and a image which may be close talk about the use of light as a medium that light become literally a building material well that immediately turn into something much broad and as a scope and again we be look at a early sketch where I be understand now that the skin can be a transition between the ground and the tower this be a building in San Francisco which be under construction and now it turn into something much much broad as a problem and it have to do with performance this will be the first building in the United States that take well I can not say it take the air condition out it be a hybrid I want a pure thing and I can not get it it be a wrong attitude actually because the hybrid be probably more interesting but we take the air conditioning out of the tower there be some air conditioning leave in the base but the skin now move on hydraulics it force air through a Venturi force if there be no wind it adjust continually and we remove the air conditioning huge huge thing half a million dollar a year delta 10 of this it be just under a million square foot 800 and some thousand square foot 10 of this would power Sausalito the delta on this and so now what we be look at as the project get large in scale as they interface with broad problem that they expand the capability in term of they performance well I could also start here we could talk about the relationship at a more biological sense of the relationship of building and ground well we research my generation for sure person who be go to school in the late 60 make very much a shift out of the internal focus of architecture look at architecture within its own territory and we be much more affect by film by what be go on in the art world etc this be of course Michael Heizer and when I see this first a image and then visit it completely change the way I think after that point and I understand that build really could be the augmentation of the Earth surface and it completely shift the notion of building ground in the most basic sense and then well he be probably look at this this be Nazca this be 700 year ago the most amazing four kilometer land sculpture they be just totally incredible and that lead we to then completely rethink how we draw how we work this be the first sketch of a high school in Pomona well whatever it be a model a conceptual kind of idea and it be the reshaping of the Earth to make it occupiable so it put 200 000 square foot of stuff that make a high school work in the surface of that Earth there it be model as it be develop into a piece of work and there it be again as it be start to get resolve tectonically and then there be the school and of course we be interested in participate with education I have absolutely no interest in produce a building that just accommodate x y and z function what I be interested in be how this idea participate in the educational process of young person it demand some sort of notion of inquiry because it be a system that be develop not sculpturally it be a idea that start from my first discussion it have to do with a broad consistent logic and that logic could be understand as one occupy the building and there be a overt at least there be a attempt to make a very overt notion of a building that connect to the land in a very different way because I be interested in a very didactic approach to the problem as one would understand that and the second project that be just finish in Los Angeles that use some of the same idea it use landscape as a major idea then again we be do the headquarters for NOAA National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency outside of Washington in Maryland and this be how they see the world they have 22 satellite zip around at plus or minus 100 mile and the site in red and what we really want to do well the architect if there be architect out there this be the Laugier Hut this be the primitive hut that be be around for so long and what we want to do be really build this because they see themselves as the caretaker of the world and we want they to look down at they satellite how they see they own site that eight acre site and we want nothing left we want it to stay green there be actually three baseball field on it right now and they be go to stay there we put one piece directly north south and it hold the dish at the ear right and then right below that the processing and the mission lift and the mission control room and all the other space be underground and what you look at be a aircraft carrier that be performance drive by the cone vision of this satellite dish and that the building itself be occupy in the low portion break up by a series of court and it be five acre of uninterrupted horizontal space for they administrative office and then that in turn propel we to look at large scale project where this notion of landscape building interface become a connective tissue the new capital competition for Berlin four year ago and again we just finish the ECB actually Coop Himmelblau in Vienna just win this project where the building be separate into a series of landscape element that become part of a connective tissue of a park which be parallel to the river and develop idea of the building themselves and become part of the connective fabric the social cultural and the landscape recreational fabric of the city and the building be no longer see as a autonomous thing but something that be only inextricably connect to this city and this place at this time and a project that be realize in Austria the Hooper Bank which again use this idea of connect typology the traditional building and morphology or the relationship of the development of land as a idea into a complex which be a piece of a city where we can see part of it be literally just this augment this movement of the land that be a very simple idea of just lift it up and occupy it and other part be much more energetic and intense and talk about that intensity in term of the collision of the kind of event they make that have to do with put a series of system together and then where part of it be in the ground part of it be oppositional lift one enter the building as it lift off the ground and it become part of the idea and then the skin the edge of this all promote the dynamic the movement of the building as a series of seismic shift geologic shift right and it make for event space and then it break in place that allow you to peer into the interior and that interior again be promote transparency for the workplace which have be a continual interest of ours and then again in a more kind of traditional setting this be a graduate student housing in Toronto and it be very much about the relationship of a building as it make a connective tissue to the city the main idea be the gateway where it break the site and the building occupy both the public space and the private space and it be that territory of it be this thing I visit the site many time and everybody kind of you can see this from two kilometer away it be a exact center of the street and the whole notion be to engage the public to engage building as part of the public tissue of the city and finally one of the most interesting project it be a courthouse and what I want to talk about this be the Supreme Court of course and well I be deal with Michael Hogan the Chief Justice of Oregon you could not proceed without make this negotiation between one own value and the relationship of the character you be work with and how he understand the court because I be show he of course Corbusier at Savoy which be 1928 which be the beginning of modern architecture well then we get to this image and this be where the project start because I be go I be interested in the phenomenon that be take place in here and really what we be talk about be construct reality and I be a character that be extremely interested in understand the nature of that construct reality because there be no such thing as nature any more nature be go Nature in the 19th century sense alright nature be only a cultural edifice today right we construct it and we construct that idea and then of course this one we governor at the moment and we spend some time with Conan believe it or not and then that lead we to kind of the very difference of we world from a legal and a artistic architectural and it force we to talk about notion of how we work and the dynamics of that and what other source of the work be and it lead we to the project the courthouse which be absolutely a part of a negotiation between tradition and piece of the traditional courthouse you will find a stair that be the same length as the Supreme Court here be a piano nobile which be a device use in the Renaissance the court be make of that the skin be this series of layer that reflect even rusticate stonework but which be embed with fragment of the Constitution which be part of the little process all set on a plinth that define it from the community thank you so much applause
