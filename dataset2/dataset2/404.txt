I have be work on issue of poverty for more than 20 year and so it be ironic that the problem that and question that I most grapple with be how you actually define poverty what do it mean so often we look at dollar term person make less than a dollar or two or three a day and yet the complexity of poverty really have to look at income as only one variable because really it be a condition about choice and the lack of freedom and I have a experience that really deepen and elucidate for I the understanding that I have it be in Kenya and I want to share it with you I be with my friend Susan Meiselas the photographer in the Mathare Valley slum now Mathare Valley be one of the old slum in Africa it be about three mile out of Nairobi and it be a mile long and about two tenth of a mile wide where over half a million person live cram in this little tin shack generation after generation rent they often eight or 10 person to a room and it be know for prostitution violence drug a hard place to grow up and when we be walk through the narrow alley it be literally impossible not to step in the raw sewage and the garbage alongside the little home but at the same time it be also impossible not to see the human vitality the aspiration and the ambition of the person who live there woman wash they baby wash they clothes hang they out to dry I meet this woman Mama Rose who have rent that little tin shack for 32 year where she live with she seven child four sleep in one twin bed and three sleep on the mud and linoleum floor and she keep they all in school by sell water from that kiosk and from sell soap and bread from the little store inside it be also the day after the inauguration and I be remind how Mathare be still connect to the globe and I would see kid on the street corner and they would say Obama he be we brother and I would say well Obama my brother so that make you my brother too and they would look quizzically and then be like high five and it be here that I meet Jane I be strike immediately by the kindness and the gentleness in she face and I ask she to tell I she story she start off by tell I she dream she say I have two my first dream be to be a doctor and the second be to marry a good man who would stay with I and my family because my mother be a single mom and could not afford to pay for school fee so I have to give up the first dream and I focus on the second she get marry when she be 18 have a baby right away and when she turn 20 find herself pregnant with a second child she mom die and she husband leave she marry another woman so she be again in Mathare with no income no skill set no money and so she ultimately turn to prostitution it be not organize in the way we often think of it she would go into the city at night with about 20 girl look for work and sometimes come back with a few shilling or sometimes with nothing and she say you know the poverty be not so bad it be the humiliation and the embarrassment of it all in 2001 she life change she have a girlfriend who have hear about this organization Jamii Bora that would lend money to person no matter how poor you be as long as you provide a commensurate amount in savings and so she spend a year to save 50 dollar and start borrow and over time she be able to buy a sewing machine she start tailor and that turn into what she do now which be to go into the secondhand clothing market and for about three dollar and 25 cent she buy a old ball gown some of they might be one you give and she repurpose they with frill and ribbon and make this frothy confection that she sell to woman for they daughter Sweet 16 or first Holy Communion that milestone in a life that person want to celebrate all along the economic spectrum and she do really good business in fact I watch she walk through the street hawk and before you know it there be a crowd of woman around she buy this dress and I reflect as I be watch she sell the dress and also the jewelry that she make that now Jane make more than four dollar a day and by many definition she be no longer poor but she still live in Mathare Valley and so she can not move out she live with all of that insecurity and in fact in January during the ethnic riot she be chase from she home and have to find a new shack in which she would live Jamii Bora understand that and understand that when we be talk about poverty we have get to look at person all along the economic spectrum and so with patient capital from Acumen and other organization loan and investment that will go the long term with they they build a low cost housing development about a hour outside Nairobi central and they design it from the perspective of customer like Jane herself insist on responsibility and accountability so she have to give 10 percent of the mortgage of the total value or about 400 dollar in savings and then they match she mortgage to what she pay in rent for she little shanty and in the next couple of week she be go to be among the first 200 family to move into this development when I ask she if she fear anything or whether she would miss anything from Mathare she say what would I fear that I have not confront already I be HIV positive I have deal with it all and she say what would I miss you think I will miss the violence or the drug the lack of privacy do you think I will miss not know if my child be go to come home at the end of the day she say if you give I 10 minute my bag would be pack I say well what about you dream and she say well you know my dream do not look exactly like I think they would when I be a little girl but if I think about it I think I want a husband but what I really want be a family that be love and I fiercely love my child and they love I back she say I think that I want to be a doctor but what I really want to be be somebody who serve and heal and cure and so I feel so blessed with everything that I have that two day a week I go and I counsel HIV patient and I say look at I you be not dead you be still alive and if you be still alive you have to serve and she say I be not a doctor who give out pill but maybe I I give out something good because I give they hope and in the middle of this economic crisis where so many of we be incline to pull in with fear I think we be well suited to take a cue from Jane and reach out recognize that be poor do not mean be ordinary because when system be break like the one that we be see around the world it be a opportunity for invention and for innovation it be a opportunity to truly build a world where we can extend service and product to all human being so that they can make decision and choice for themselves I truly believe it be where dignity start we owe it to the Janes of the world and just as important we owe it to ourselves thank you applause
