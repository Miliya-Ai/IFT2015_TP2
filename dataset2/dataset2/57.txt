what I be go to do in the spirit of collaborative creativity be simply repeat many of the point that the three person before I have already make but do they this be call creative collaboration it be actually call borrowing but do it through a particular perspective and that be to ask about the role of user and consumer in this emerge world of collaborative creativity that Jimmy and other have talk about let I just ask you to start with this simple question who invent the mountain bike because traditional economic theory would say well the mountain bike be probably invent by some big bike corporation that have a big r d lab where they be think up new project and it come out of there it do not come from there another answer might be well it come from a sort of lone genius work in he garage who work away on different kind of bike come up with a bike out of thin air it do not come from there the mountain bike come from user come from young user particularly a group in Northern California who be frustrate with traditional racing bike which be that sort of bike that Eddy Merckx ride or you big brother and they be very glamorous but also frustrate with the bike that you dad ride which sort of have big handlebars like that and they be too heavy so they get the frame from this big bike put they together with the gear from the racing bike get the brake from motorcycle and sort of mixed and matched various ingredient and for the first I do not know three to five year of they life mountain bike be know as clunker and they be just make in a community of biker mainly in Northern California and then one of this company that be import part for the clunker decide to set up in business start sell they to other person and gradually another company emerge out of that Marin and it probably be I do not know 10 maybe even 15 year before the big bike company realize there be a market thirty year late mountain bike sale and mountain bike equipment account for 65 percent of bike sale in America that be 58 billion dollar this be a category entirely create by consumer that would not have be create by the mainstream bike market because they could not see the need the opportunity they do not have the incentive to innovate the one thing I think I disagree with about Yochai presentation be when he say the internet cause this distributive capacity for innovation to come alive it be when the internet combine with this kind of passionate pro am consumer who be knowledgeable they have get the incentive to innovate they have get the tool they want to that you get this kind of explosion of creative collaboration and out of that you get the need for the kind of thing that Jimmy be talk about which be we new kind of organization or a good way to put it how do we organize ourselves without organization that be now possible you do not need a organization to be organize to achieve large and complex task like innovate new software program so this be a huge challenge to the way we think creativity come about the traditional view still enshrine in much of the way that we think about creativity in organization in government be that creativity be about special person wear baseball cap the wrong way round come to conference like this in special place elite university r d lab in the forest water maybe special room in company paint funny color you know bean bag maybe the odd table football table special person special place think up special idea then you have a pipeline that take the idea down to the wait consumer who be passive they can say yes or no to the invention that be the idea of creativity what be the policy recommendation out of that if you be in government or you be run a large company more special person more special place build creative cluster in city create more r d park so on and so forth Expand the pipeline down to the consumer well this view I think be increasingly wrong I think it be always be wrong because I think always creativity have be highly collaborative and it be probably be largely interactive but it be increasingly wrong and one of the reason it be wrong be that the idea be flow back up the pipeline the idea be come back from the consumer and they be often ahead of the producer why be that well one issue be that radical innovation when you have get idea that affect a large number of technology or person have a great deal of uncertainty attach to they the payoff to innovation be great where the uncertainty be high and when you get a radical innovation it be often very uncertain how it can be apply the whole history of telephony be a story of deal with that uncertainty the very first landline telephone the inventor think that they would be use for person to listen in to live performance from West End theater when the mobile telephone company invent sm they have no idea what it be for it be only when that technology get into the hand of teenage user that they invent the use so the more radical the innovation the more the uncertainty the more you need innovation in use to work out what a technology be for all of we patent we entire approach to patent and invention be base on the idea that the inventor know what the invention be for we can say what it be for more and more the inventor of thing will not be able to say that in advance it will be work out in use in collaboration with user we like to think that invention be a sort of moment of creation there be a moment of birth when someone come up with a idea the truth be that most creativity be cumulative and collaborative like Wikipedia it develop over a long period of time the second reason why user be more and more important be that they be the source of big disruptive innovation if you want to find the big new idea it be often difficult to find they in mainstream market in big organization and just look inside large organization and you will see why that be so so you be in a big corporation you be obviously keen to go up the corporate ladder do you go into you board and say look I have get a fantastic idea for a embryonic product in a marginal market with consumer we have never deal with before and I be not sure it be go to have a big payoff but it could be really really big in the future no what you do be you go in and you say I have get a fantastic idea for a incremental innovation to a exist product we sell through exist channel to exist user and I can guarantee you get this much return out of it over the next three year big corporation have a in build tendency to reinforce past success they have get so much sink in it that it be very difficult for they to spot emerge new market emerge new market then be the breeding grounds for passionate user good example who in the music industry 30 year ago would have say yes let invent a musical form which be all about dispossessed black man in ghetto express they frustration with the world through a form of music that many person find initially quite difficult to listen to that sound like a winner we will go with it laughter so what happen rap music be create by the user they do it on they own tape with they own record equipment they distribute it themselves 30 year late rap music be the dominant musical form of popular culture would never have come from the big company have to start this be the third point with this pro am this be the phrase that I have use in some stuff which I have do with a think tank in London call demo where we have be look at this person who be amateur I e they do it for the love of it but they want to do it to very high standard and across a whole range of field from software astronomy natural science vast area of leisure and culture like kite surfing so on and so forth you find person who want to do thing because they love it but they want to do this thing to very high standard they work at they leisure if you like they take they leisure very seriously they acquire skill they invest time they use technology that be get cheap it be not just the internet camera design technology leisure technology surfboard so on and so forth largely through globalization a lot of this equipment have get a lot cheap more knowledgeable consumer more educate more able to connect with one another more able to do thing together Consumption in that sense be a expression of they productive potential why we find person be interested in this be that at work they do not feel very express they do not feel as if they be do something that really matter to they so they pick up this kind of activity this have huge organizational implication for very large area of life take astronomy as a example which Yochai have already mention twenty year ago 30 year ago only big professional astronomer with very big telescope could see far into space and there be a big telescope in Northern England call Jodrell Bank and when I be a kid it be amazing because the moon shot would take off and this thing would move on rail and it be huge it be absolutely enormous now six amateur astronomer work with the internet with dobsonian digital telescope which be pretty much open source with some light sensor develop over the last 10 year the internet they can do what Jodrell Bank could only do 30 year ago so here in astronomy you have this vast explosion of new productive resource the user can be producer what do this mean then for we organizational landscape well just imagine a world for the moment divide into two camp over here you have get the old traditional corporate model special person special place patent it push it down the pipeline to largely wait passive consumer over here let imagine we have get Wikipedia Linux and beyond open source this be open this be close this be new this be traditional well the first thing you can say I think with certainty be what Yochai have say already be there be a great big struggle between that two organizational form this person over there will do everything they can to stop this kind of organization succeed because they be threaten by they and so the debate about copyright digital right so on and so forth this be all about try to stifle in my view this kind of organization what we be see be a complete corruption of the idea of patent and copyright mean to be a way to incentivize invention mean to be a way to orchestrate the dissemination of knowledge they be increasingly be use by large company to create thicket of patent to prevent innovation take place let I just give you two example the first be imagine yourself go to a venture capitalist and say I have get a fantastic idea I have invent this brilliant new program that be much much good than Microsoft Outlook which venture capitalist in they right mind be go to give you any money to set up a venture compete with Microsoft with Microsoft Outlook no one that be why the competition with Microsoft be bind to come will only come from a open source kind of project so there be a huge competitive argument about sustain the capacity for open source and consumer drive innovation because it be one of the great competitive lever against monopoly there will be huge professional argument as well because the professional over here in this closed organization they might be academic they might be programmer they might be doctor they might be journalist my former profession say no no you can not trust this person over here when I start in journalism Financial Times 20 year ago it be very very exciting to see someone read the newspaper and you would kind of look over they shoulder on the tube to see if they be read you article usually they be read the share price and the bit of the paper with you article on be on the floor or something like that and you know for heaven sake what be they do they be not read my brilliant article and we allow user reader two place where they could contribute to the paper the letter page where they could write a letter in and we would condescend to they cut it in half and print it three day late or the op ed page where if they know the editor have be to school with he sleep with he wife they could write a article for the op ed page that be the two place shock horror now the reader want to be writer and publisher that be not they role they be suppose to read what we write but they do not want to be journalist the journalist think that the blogger want to be journalist they do not want to be journalist they just want to have a voice they want to as Jimmy say they want to have a dialogue a conversation they want to be part of that flow of information what be happen there be that the whole domain of creativity be expand so there be go to be a tremendous struggle but also there be go to be tremendous movement from the open to the close what you will see I think be two thing that be critical and this I think be two challenge for the open movement the first be can we really survive on volunteer if this be so critical do we not need it fund organize support in much more structured way I think the idea of create the Red Cross for information and knowledge be a fantastic idea but can we really organize that just on volunteer what kind of change do we need in public policy and funding to make that possible what be the role of the BBC for instance in that world what should be the role of public policy and finally what I think you will see be the intelligent closed organization move increasingly in the open direction so it be not go to be a contest between two camp but in between they you will find all sort of interesting place that person will occupy New organizational model come about mix close and open in tricky way it will not be so clear cut it will not be Microsoft versus Linux there will be all sort of thing in between and that organizational model it turn out be incredibly powerful and the person who can understand they will be very very successful let I just give you one final example of what that mean I be in Shanghai in a office block build on what be a rice paddy five year ago one of the 2 500 skyscraper they have build in Shanghai in the last 10 year and I be have dinner with this guy call Timothy Chan Timothy Chan set up a internet business in 2000 do not go into the internet keep he money decide to go into computer game he run a company call Shanda which be the large computer game company in China nine thousand server all over China have 250 million subscriber at any one time there be four million person play one of he game how many person do he employ to service that population 500 person well how can he service 250 million person from 500 employee because basically he do not service they he give they a platform he give they some rule he give they the tool and then he kind of orchestrate the conversation he orchestrate the action but actually a lot of the content be create by the user themselves and it create a kind of stickiness between the community and the company which be really really powerful the good measure of that so you go into one of he game you create a character that you develop in the course of the game if for some reason you credit card bounce or there be some other problem you lose you character you have get two option one option you can create a new character right from scratch but with none of the history of you player that cost about 100 dollar or you can get on a plane fly to Shanghai queue up outside Shanda office cost probably 600 700 dollar and reclaim you character get you history back every morning there be 600 person queue outside they office to reclaim this character laughter so this be about company build on community that provide community with tool resource platform in which they can share he be not open source but it be very very powerful so here be one of the challenge I think for person like I who do a lot of work with government if you be a game company and you have get a million player in you game you only need one percent of they to be co developer contribute idea and you have get a development workforce of 10 000 person imagine you could take all the child in education in Britain and one percent of they be co developer of education what would that do to the resource available to the education system or if you get one percent of the patient in the nhs to in some sense be co producer of health the reason why despite all the effort to cut it down to constrain it to hold it back why this open model will still start emerge with tremendous force be that they multiply we productive resource and one of the reason they do that be that they turn user into producer consumer into designer thank you very much
