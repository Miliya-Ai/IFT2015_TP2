one way to change we gene be to make new one as Craig Venter have so elegantly show another be to change we lifestyle and what we be learn be how powerful and dynamic this change can be that you do not have to wait very long to see the benefit when you eat healthy manage stress exercise and love more you brain actually get more blood flow and more oxygen but more than that you brain get measurably big thing that be think impossible just a few year ago can actually be measure now this be figure out by Robin Williams a few year before the rest of we now there be some thing that you can do to make you brain grow new brain cell some of my favorite thing like chocolate and tea blueberry alcohol in moderation stress management and cannabinoid find in marijuana I be just the messenger laughter what be we just talk about laughter and other thing that can make it bad that can cause you to lose brain cell the usual suspect like saturate fat and sugar nicotine opiate cocaine too much alcohol and chronic stress you skin get more blood flow when you change you lifestyle so you age less quickly you skin do not wrinkle as much you heart get more blood flow we have show that you can actually reverse heart disease that this clog artery that you see on the upper left after only a year become measurably less clogged and the cardiac pet scan show on the low leave the blue mean no blood flow a year late orange and white be maximum blood flow we have show you may be able to stop and reverse the progression of early prostate cancer and by extension breast cancer simply by make this change we have find that tumor growth in vitro be inhibit 70 percent in the group that make this change whereas only nine percent in the comparison group this difference be highly significant even you sexual organ get more blood flow so you increase sexual potency one of the most effective anti smoke ad be do by the Department of Health Services show that nicotine which constrict you artery can cause a heart attack or a stroke but it also cause impotence half of guy who smoke be impotent how sexy be that now we be also about to publish a study the first study show you can change gene expression in man with prostate cancer this be what be call a heat map and the different color and along the side on the right be different gene and we find that over 500 gene be favorably change in effect turn on the good gene the disease prevent gene turn off the disease promote gene and so this finding I think be really very powerful give many person new hope and new choice and company like Navigenics and DNA Direct and 23andMe that be give you you genetic profile be give some person a sense of gosh well what can I do about it well we gene be not we fate and if we make this change they be a predisposition but if we make big change than we might have make otherwise we can actually change how we gene be express thank you applause
