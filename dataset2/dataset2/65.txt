good morning everyone First of all it be be fantastic be here over this past few day and secondly I feel it be a great honor to kind of wind up this extraordinary gathering of person this amazing talk that we have have I feel that I have fit in in many way to some of the thing that I have hear I come directly here from the deep deep tropical rainforest in Ecuador where I be out you could only get there by a plane with indigenous person with paint on they face and parrot feather on they headdress where this person be fight to try and keep the oil company and keep the road out of they forest they be fight to develop they own way of live within the forest in a world that be clean a world that be not contaminate a world that be not pollute and what be so amazing to I and what fit right in with what we be all talk about here at TED be that there right in the middle of this rainforest be some solar panel the first in that part of Ecuador and that be mainly to bring water up by pump so that the woman would not have to go down the water be clean but because they get a lot of battery they be able to store a lot of electricity so every house and there be I think eight house in this little community could have light for I think it be about half a hour each evening and there be the Chief in all he regal finery with a laptop computer laughter and this man he have be outside but he be go back and he be say you know we have suddenly jump into a whole new era and we do not even know about the white man 50 year ago and now here we be with laptop computer and there be some thing we want to learn from the modern world we want to know about health care we want to know about what other person do we be interested in it and we want to learn other language we want to know English and French and perhaps Chinese and we be good at language so there he be with he little laptop computer but fighting against the might of the pressure because of the debt the foreign debt of Ecuador fight the pressure of World Bank IMF and of course the person who want to exploit the forest and take out the oil and so come directly from there to here but of course my real field of expertise lie in a even different kind of civilization I can not really call it a civilization a different way of life a different be we have talk early this wonderful talk by Wade Davis about the different culture of the human around the world but the world be not compose only of human being there be also other animal being and I propose to bring into this TED conference as I always do around the world the voice of the animal kingdom too often we just see a few slide or a bit of film but this being have voice that mean something and so I want to give you a greeting as from a chimpanzee in the forest of Tanzania Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh applause I have be study chimpanzee in Tanzania since 1960 during that time there have be modern technology that have really transform the way that field biologist do they work for example for the first time a few year ago by simply collect little fecal sample we be able to have they analyze to have dna profiling do so for the first time we actually know which male chimp be the father of each individual infant because the chimp have a very promiscuous mating society so this open up a whole new avenue of research and we use GSI geographic whatever it be GSI to determine the range of the chimp and we be use you can see that I be not really into this kind of stuff but we be use satellite imagery to look at the deforestation in the area and of course there be development in infrared so you can watch animal at night and equipment for recording by video and tape recording be get light and good so in many many way we can do thing today that we could not do when I begin in 1960 especially when chimpanzee and other animal with large brain be study in captivity modern technology be help we to search for the upper level of cognition in some of this non human animal so that we know today they be capable of performance that would have be think absolutely impossible by science when I begin I think the chimpanzee in captivity who be the most skilled in intellectual performance be one call Ai in Japan she name mean love and she have a wonderfully sensitive partner work with she she love she computer she will leave she big group and she running water and she tree and everything and she will come in to sit at this computer it be like a video game for a kid she be hooked she be 28 by the way and she do thing with she computer screen and a touch pad that she can do fast than most human she do very complex task and I have not get time to go into they but the amazing thing about this female be she do not like make mistake if she have a bad run and she score be not good she will come and reach up and tap on the glass because she can not see the experimenter which be ask to have another go and she concentration she be already concentrate hard for 20 minute or so and now she want to do it all over again just for the satisfaction of have do it well and the food be not important she do get a tiny reward like one raisin for a correct response but she will do it for nothing if you tell she beforehand so here we be a chimpanzee use a computer Chimpanzees gorilla orangutan also learn human sign language but the point be that when I be first in Gombe in 1960 I remember so well so vividly as though it be yesterday the first time when I be go through the vegetation the chimpanzee be still run away from I for the most part although some be a little bit acclimatize and I see this dark shape hunch over a termite mound and I peer with my binoculars it be fortunately one adult male whom I have name David Greybeard and by the way science at that time be tell I that I should not name the chimp they should all have number that be more scientific anyway David Greybeard and I see that he be pick little piece of grass and use they to fish termite from they underground nest and not only that he would sometimes pick a leafy twig and strip the leaf modify a object to make it suitable for a specific purpose the beginning of tool make the reason this be so exciting and such a breakthrough be at that time it be think that human and only human use and make tool when I be at school we be define as man the toolmaker so that when Louis Leakey my mentor hear this news he say ah we must now redefine man redefine tool or accept chimpanzee as human laughter we now know that at Gombe alone there be nine different way in which chimpanzee use different object for different purpose moreover we know that in different part of Africa wherever chimp have be study there be completely different tool use behavior and because it seem that this pattern be pass from one generation to the next through observation imitation and practice that be a definition of human culture what we find be that over this 40 odd year that I and other have be study chimpanzee and the other great ape and as I say other mammal with complex brain and social system we have find that after all there be not a sharp line divide human from the rest of the animal kingdom it be a very wuzzy line it be get wuzzy all the time as we find animal do thing that we in we arrogance use to think be just human the chimp there be no time to discuss they fascinating life but they have this long childhood five year of suckling and sleep with the mother and then another three four or five year of emotional dependence on she even when the next child be bear the importance of learning in that time when behavior be flexible and there be a awful lot to learn in chimpanzee society the long term affectionate supportive bond that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother with the brother and sister and which can last through a lifetime which may be up to 60 year they can actually live long than 60 in captivity so we have only do 40 year in the wild so far and we find chimp be capable of true compassion and altruism we find in they non verbal communication this be very rich they have a lot of sound which they use in different circumstance but they also use touch posture gesture and what do they do they kiss they embrace they hold hand they pat one another on the back they swagger they shake they fist the kind of thing that we do and they do they in the same kind of context they have very sophisticated cooperation sometimes they hunt not that often but when they hunt they show sophisticated cooperation and they share the prey we find that they show emotion similar to maybe sometimes the same as that that we describe in ourselves as happiness sadness fear despair they know mental as well as physical suffering and I do not have time to go into the information that will prove some of this thing to you save to say that there be very bright student in the good university study emotion in animal study personality in animal we know that chimpanzee and some other creature can recognize themselves in mirror self as oppose to other they have a sense of humor and this be the kind of thing which traditionally have be think of as human prerogative but this teach we a new respect and it be a new respect not only for the chimpanzee I suggest but some of the other amazing animal with whom we share this planet once we be prepared to admit that after all we be not the only being with personality mind and above all feeling and then we start to think about way we use and abuse so many other sentient sapient creature on this planet it really give cause for deep shame at least for I so the sad thing be that this chimpanzee who have perhaps teach we more than any other creature a little humility be in the wild disappear very fast they be disappear for the reason that all of you in this room know only too well the deforestation the growth of human population need more land they be disappear because some timber company go in with clear cutting they be disappear in the heart of they range in Africa because the big multinational log company have come in and make road as they want to do in Ecuador and other part where the forest remain untouched to take out oil or timber and this have lead in Congo basin and other part of the world to what be know as the bush meat trade this mean that although for hundred perhaps thousand of year person have live in that forest or whatever habitat it be in harmony with they world just kill the animal they need for themselves and they family now suddenly because of the road the hunter can go in from the town they shoot everything every single thing that move that be big than a small rat they sun dry it or smoke it and now they have get transport they take it on the log truck or the mining truck into the town where they sell it and person will pay more for bush meat as it be call than for domestic meat it be culturally prefer and it be not sustainable and the huge log camp in the forest be now demand meat so the pygmy hunter in the Congo basin who have live there with they wonderful way of live for so many hundred of year be now corrupt they be give weapon they shoot for the log camp they get money they culture be be destroy along with the animal upon whom they depend so when the log camp move there be nothing left we talk already about the loss of human cultural diversity and I have see it happen with my own eye and the grim picture in Africa I love Africa and what do we see in Africa we see deforestation we see the desert spread we see massive hunger we see disease and we see population growth in area where there be more person live on a certain piece of land than the land can possibly support and they be too poor to buy food from elsewhere be the person that we hear about yesterday on the Easter Island who cut down they last tree be they stupid do not they know what be happen of course but if you have see the crippling poverty in some of this part of the world it be not a question of let leave the tree for tomorrow how be I go to feed my family today maybe I can get just a few dollar from this last tree which will keep we go a little bit long and then we will pray that something will happen to save we from the inevitable end so this be a pretty grim picture the one thing we have which make we so different from chimpanzee or other live creature be this sophisticated spoken language a language with which we can tell child about thing that be not here we can talk about the distant past plan for the distant future discuss idea with each other so that the idea can grow from the accumulate wisdom of a group we can do it by talk to each other we can do it through video we can do it through the write word and we be abuse this great power we have to be wise steward and we be destroy the world in the developed world in a way it be bad because we have so much access to knowledge of the stupidity of what we be do do you know we be bring little baby into a world where in many place the water be poison they and the air be harm they and the food that be grow from the contaminated land be poison they and that be not just in the far away develop world that be everywhere do you know we all have about 50 chemical in we body we do not have about 50 year ago and so many of this disease like asthma and certain kind of cancer be on the increase around place where we filthy toxic waste be dump we be harm ourselves around the world as well as harm the animal as well as harm nature herself Mother Nature that bring we into be Mother Nature where I believe we need to spend time where there be tree and flower and bird for we good psychological development and yet there be hundred and hundred of child in the developed world who never see nature because they be grow up in concrete and all they know be virtual reality with no opportunity to go and lie in the sun or in the forest with the dappled sun speck come down from the canopy above as I be travel around the world you know I have to leave the forest that be where I love to be I have to leave this fascinating chimpanzee for my student and field staff to continue study because find they dwindle from about two million 100 year ago to about 150 000 now I know I have to leave the forest to do what I could to raise awareness around the world and the more I talk about the chimpanzee plight the more I realize the fact that everything interconnect and the problem of the develop world so often stem from the greed of the developed world and everything be join together and make not sense hope lie in sense you say it be make a nonsense how can we do it somebody say that yesterday and as I be travel around I keep meet young person who have lose hope they be feel despair they be feel well it do not matter what we do eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die everything be hopeless we be always be tell so by the media and then I meet some who be angry and anger that can turn to violence and we be all familiar with that and I have three little grandchild and when some of this student would say to I at high school or university they would say we be angry or we be fill with despair because we feel you have compromise we future and there be nothing we can do about it and I look in the eye of my little grandchild and think how much we have harm this planet since I be they age I feel this deep shame and that be why in 1991 in Tanzania I start a program that be call root and shoot there be little brochure all around outside and if any of you have anything to do with child and care about they future I beg that you pick up that brochure and root and shoot be a program for hope root make a firm foundation shoot seem tiny but to reach the sun they can break through brick wall see the brick wall as all the problem that we have inflict on this planet then you see it be a message of hope hundred and thousand of young person around the world can break through and can make this a good world and the most important message of root and shoot be that every single individual make a difference every individual have a role to play every one of we impact the world around we everyday and you scientist know that you can not actually even if you stay in bed all day you be breathe oxygen and give out co2 and probably go to the loo and thing like that you be make a difference in the world so the root and shoot program involve youth in three kind of project and this be project to make the world around they a good place one project to show care and concern for you own human community one for animal include domestic animal and I have to say I learn everything I know about animal behavior even before I get to Gombe and the chimp from my dog Rusty who be my childhood companion and the third kind of project something for the local environment so what the kid do depend first of all how old be they and we go now from pre school right through university it be go to depend whether they be inner city or rural it be go to depend if they be wealthy or impoverished it be go to depend which part say of America they be in we be in every state now and the problem in Florida be different from the problem in New York it be go to depend on which country they be in and we be already in 60 plus country with about 5 000 active group and there be group all over the place that I keep hear about that I have never even hear of because the kid be take the program and spread it themselves why because they be buy into it and they be the one who get to decide what they be go to do it be not something that they parent tell they or they teacher tell they that be effective but if they decide themselves we want to clean this river and put the fish back that use to be there we want to clear away the toxic soil from this area and have a organic garden we want to go and spend time with the old person and hear they story and record they oral history we want to go and work in a dog shelter we want to learn about animal we want you know it go on and on and this be very hopeful for I as I travel around the world 300 day a year everywhere there be a group of root and shoot of different age everywhere there be child with shine eye say look at the difference we have make and now come the technology into it because with this new way of communicate electronically this kid can communicate with each other around the world and if anyone be interested to help we we have get so many idea but we need help we need help to create the right kind of system that will help this young person to communicate they excitement but also and this be so important to communicate they despair to say we have try this and it do not work and what shall we do and then lo and behold there be another group answer this kid who may be in America or maybe this be a group in Israel say yeah you do it a little bit wrong this be how you should do it the philosophy be very simple we do not believe in violence no violence no bomb no gun that be not the way to solve problem violence lead to violence at least in my view so how do we solve the tool for solve the problem be knowledge and understanding know the fact but see how they fit in the big picture hard work and persistence do not give up and love and compassion lead to respect for all life how many more minute two one Chris Anderson one one to two Jane Goodall two two I be go to take two laughter be you go to come and drag I off laughter anyway so basically root and shoot be begin to change young person life it be what I be devote most of my energy to and I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact not just because you can share technology with we but because so many of you have child and if you take this program out and give it to you child they have such a good opportunity to go out and do good because they have get parent like you and it be be so clear how much you all care about try to make this world a good place it be very encouraging but the kid do ask I and this will not take more than two minute I promise the kid say Dr Jane do you really have hope for the future you travel you see all this horrible thing happen firstly the human brain I do not need to say anything about that now that we know what the problem be around the world human brain like yours be rise to solve that problem and we have talk a lot about that secondly the resilience of nature we can destroy a river and we can bring it back to life we can see a whole area desolate and it can be bring back to bloom again with time or a little help and thirdly the last speaker talk about or the speaker before last talk about the indomitable human spirit we be surround by the most amazing person who do thing that seem to be absolutely impossible Nelson Mandela I take a little piece of limestone from Robben Island Prison where he labor for 27 year and come out with so little bitterness he could lead he person from the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath even after the 11th of September and I be in New York and I feel the fear nevertheless there be so much human courage so much love and so much compassion and then as I go around the country after that and feel the fear the fear that be lead to person feel they could not worry about the environment any more in case they seem not to be patriotic and I be try to encourage they somebody come up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi if you look back through human history you see that every evil regime have be overcome by good and just after that a woman bring I this little bell and I want to end on this note she say if you be talk about hope and peace ring this this bell be make from metal from a defuse landmine from the kill field of Pol Pot one of the most evil regime in human history where person be now begin to put they life back together after the regime have crumble so yes there be hope and where be the hope be it out there with the politician it be in we hand it be in you hand and my hand and that of we child it be really up to we we be the one who can make a difference if we lead life where we consciously leave the light possible ecological footprint if we buy the thing that be ethical for we to buy and do not buy the thing that be not we can change the world overnight thank you
