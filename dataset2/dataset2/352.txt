it be amazing when you meet a head of state and you say what be you most precious natural resource they will not say child at first and then when you say child they will pretty quickly agree with you Video we be travel today with the Minister of Defense of Colombia head of the army and the head of the police and we be drop off 650 laptop today to child who have no television no telephone and have be in a community cut off from the rest of the world for the past 40 year the importance of deliver laptop to this region be connect kid who have otherwise be unconnected because of the FARC the guerrilla that start off 40 year ago as a political movement and then become a drug movement there be one billion child in the world and 50 percent of they do not have electricity at home or at school and in some country let I pick Afghanistan 75 percent of the little girl do not go to school and I do not mean that they drop out of school in the third or fourth grade they do not go so in the three year since I talk at TED and show a prototype it be go from a idea to a real laptop we have half a million laptop today in the hand of child we have about a quarter of a million in transit to that and other child and then there be another quarter of a million more that be be order at this moment so in rough number there be a million laptop that be small than I predict I predict three to 10 million but be still a very large number in Colombia we have about 3 000 laptop it be the Minister of Defense with whom we be work not the Minister of Education because it be see as a strategic defense issue in the sense of liberate this zone that have be completely close off in which the person who have be cause if you will 40 year worth of bombing and kidnapping and assassination live and suddenly the kid have connect laptop they have leapfrog the change be absolutely monumental because it be not just open it up but it be open it up to the rest of the world so yes they be build road yes they be put in telephone yes there will be television but the kid six to 12 year old be surf the internet in Spanish and in local language so the child grow up with access to information with a window into the rest of the world before they be close off interestingly enough in other country it will be the Minister of Finance who see it as a engine of economic growth and that engine be go to see the result in 20 year it be not go to happen you know in one year but it be a important deeply economic and cultural change that happen through child thirty one country in total be involve and in the case of Uruguay half the child already have they and by the middle of 2009 every single child in Uruguay will have a laptop a little green laptop now what be some of the result some of the result that go across every single country include teacher say they have never love teaching so much and reading comprehension measure by third party not by we skyrocket probably the most important thing we see be child teach parent they own the laptop they take they home and so when I meet with three child from the school who have travel all day to come to Bogota one of the three child bring she mother and the reason she bring she mother be that this six year old child have be teach she mother how to read and write she mother have not go to primary school and this be such a inversion and such a wonderful example of child be the agent of change so now in close person say now why laptop laptop be a luxury it be like give they iPods no the reason you want laptop be that the word be education not laptop this be a education project not a laptop project they need to learn learning and then just think they can have let say 100 book in a village you have 100 laptop each with a different set of 100 book and so that village suddenly have 10 000 book you and I do not have 10 000 book when we go to primary school sometimes school be under a tree or in many case the teacher have only a fifth grade education so you need a collaborative model of learn not just build more school and train more teacher which you have to do anyway so we be once again do give one get one last year we run a give one get one program and it generate over 100 000 laptop that we be then able to give free and by be a zero dollar laptop we can go to country that can not afford it at all and that be what we do we go to Haiti we go to Rwanda Afghanistan Ethiopia Mongolia Places that be not market seed it with the principle of saturation connectivity low age etc and then we can actually roll out large number so think of it this way think of it as inoculate child against ignorance and think of the laptop as a vaccine you do not vaccinate a few child you vaccinate all the child in a area
