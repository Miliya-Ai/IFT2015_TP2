I will just start talk about the 17th century I hope nobody find that offensive I you know when I after I have invent pcr I kind of need a change and I move down to La Jolla and learn how to surf and I start live down there on the beach for a long time and when surfer be out wait for wave you probably wonder if you have never be out there what be they do you know sometimes there be a 10 15 minute break out there when you be wait for a wave to come in they usually talk about the 17th century you know they get a real bad rap in the world person think they be sort of lowbrow one day somebody suggest I read this book it be call it be call the Air Pump or something like the Leviathan and The Air pump it be a real weird book about the 17th century and I realize the root of the way I sort of think be just the only natural way to think about thing that you know I be bear think about thing that way and I have always be like a little scientist guy and when I go to find out something I use scientific method I be not real surprise you know when they first tell I how how you be suppose to do science because I have already be do it for fun and whatever but it do not it never occur to I that it have to be invent and that it have be invent only 350 year ago you know it be like it happen in England and Germany and Italy sort of all at the same time and the story of that I think be really fascinating so I be go to talk a little bit about that and what exactly be it that scientist be suppose to do and it be it be a kind of you know Charles I get behead somewhere early in the 17th century and the English set up Cromwell and a whole bunch of Republican or whatever and not the kind of Republican we have they change the government and it do not work and Charles II the son be finally put back on the throne of England he be really nervous because he dad have be you know behead for be the King of England and he be nervous about the fact that conversation that get go in like bar and stuff would turn to this be kind of it be hard to believe but person in the 17th century in England be start to talk about you know philosophy and stuff in bar they do not have tv screen and they do not have any football game to watch and they would get really pissy and all of a sudden person would spill out into the street and fight about issue like whether or not it be okay if Robert Boyle make a device call the vacuum pump now Boyle be a friend of Charles II he be a Christian guy during the weekend but during the week he be a scientist laughter which be back then it be sort of you know well you know if you make this thing he make this little device like kind of like a bicycle pump in reverse that could suck all the air out of you know what a bell jar be one of this thing you pick it up put it down and it be get a seal and you can see inside of it so you can see what be go on inside this thing but what he be try to do be to pump all the air out of there and see what would happen inside there I mean the first I think one of the first experiment he do be he put a bird in there and person in the 17th century they do not really understand the same way we do about you know this stuff be a bunch of different kind of molecule and we breathe it in for a purpose and all that I mean fish do not know much about water and person do not know much about air but both start explore it one thing he put a bird in there and he pump all the air out and the bird die so he say hmm he say he call what he have do as make they do not call it a vacuum pump at the time now you call it a vacuum pump he call it a vacuum right and immediately he get into trouble with the local clergy who say you can not make a vacuum ah uh laughter Aristotle say that nature abhor one I think it be a poor translation probably but person rely on authority like that and you know Boyle say well shit I make they all the time I mean whatever that be that kill the bird and I be call it a vacuum and the religious person say that if God want you to make I mean God be everywhere that be one of they rule be God be everywhere and a vacuum there be nothing in a vacuum so you have God could not be in there so therefore the church say that you can not make a vacuum you know and Boyle say bullshit I mean you want to call it godless you know you call it godless but that be not my job I be not into that I do that on the weekend and like what I be try to do be figure out what happen when you suck everything out of a compartment and he do all this cute little experiment like he do one with he have a little wheel like a fan that be sort of loosely attach so it could spin by itself he have another fan oppose to it that he have like a I mean the way I would have do this would be like a rubber band and you know around a tinker toy kind of fan I know exactly how he do it I have see the draw it be two fan one which he could turn from outside after he get the vacuum establish and he discover that if he pull all the air out of it the one fan would no longer turn the other one right something be miss you know I mean this be it be kind of weird to think that someone have to do a experiment to show that but that be what be go on at the time and like there be big argument about it in the you know the gin house and in the coffee shop and stuff and Charles start not like that Charles II be kind of say you know you should keep that let make a place where you can do this stuff where person do not get so you know we do not want the we do not want to get the person mad at I again and so because when they start talk about religion and science and stuff like that that be when it have sort of get he father in trouble and so Charles say I be go to put up the money give you guy a building come here and you can meet in the building but just do not talk about religion in there and that be fine with Boyle he say ok we be go to start have this meeting and anybody who want to do science be this be about the time that Isaac Newton be start to whip out a lot of really interesting thing and there be all kind of person that would come to the Royal Society they call it you have to be dress up pretty well it be not like a TED conference that be the only criterion be that you be you look like a gentleman and they would let anybody could come you do not have to be a member then and so they would come in and you would do anybody that be go to show a experiment which be kind of a new word at the time demonstrate some principle they have to do it on stage where everybody could see it so they be the really important part of this be you be not suppose to talk about final cause for instance and God be out of the picture the actual nature of reality be not at issue you be not suppose to talk about the absolute nature of anything you be not suppose to talk about anything that you could not demonstrate so if somebody could see it you could say here be how the machine work here be what we do and then here be what happen and see what happen it be ok to generalize and say I be sure that this will happen anytime we make one of this thing and so you can start make up some rule you say anytime you have a vacuum state you will discover that one wheel will not turn another one if the only connection between they be whatever be there before the vacuum that kind of thing candle can not burn in a vacuum therefore probably sparkler would not either it be not clear actually sparkl will but they do not know that they do not have sparkler but they laughter you can make up rule but they have to relate only to the thing that you have be able to demonstrate and most the demonstration have to do with visual like if you do a experiment on stage and nobody can see it they can just hear it they would probably think you be freaky I mean reality be what you can see that be not a explicit rule in the meeting but I be sure that be part of it you know if person hear voice and they can not see and associate it with somebody that person probably not there but the general idea that you could only you could only really talk about thing in that place that have some kind of experimental basis it do not matter what Thomas Hobbes who be a local philosopher say about it you know because you be not go to be talk final cause what be happen here in the middle of the 17th century be that what become my field science experimental science be pull itself away and it be in a physical way because we be go to do it in this room over here but it be also what it be a amazing thing that happen Science have be all interlock with theology and philosophy and and and mathematics which be really not science but experimental science have be tie up with all that thing and the mathematics part and the experimental science part be pull away from philosophy and thing we never look back it be be so cool since then I mean it just it just untangle a thing that be really impede technology from be develop and I mean everybody in this room now this be 350 short year ago remember that be a short time it be 300 000 probably year ago that most of we the ancestor of most of we in this room come up out of Africa and turn to the left you know the one that turn to the right there be some of that in the Japanese translation but that happen very a long time ago compare to 350 short year ago but in that 350 year the place have just undergo a lot of change in fact everybody in this room probably especially if you pick up you bag some of you I know do not pick up you bag but if you pick up you bag everybody in this room have get in they pocket or back in they room something that 350 year ago king would have go to war to have I mean if you can think how important if you have a gps system and there be no satellite it be not go to be much use but like but you know if somebody have a gps system in the 17th century some king would have get together a army and go to get it you know if that person audience for the teddy bear the teddy bear Kary Mullis they might have do it for the teddy bear yeah but all of we own stuff I mean individual own thing that king would have definitely go to war to get and this be just 350 year not a whole lot of person do this stuff you know the important person you can almost read about they life about all the really important person that make advance you know and I mean this kind of stuff you know all this stuff come from that separation of this little sort of thing that we do now I when I be a boy be bear sort of with this idea that if you want to know something you know maybe it be because my old man be go a lot and my mother do not really know much science but I think if you want to know something about stuff you do it you make a experiment you know you get you get like I just have a natural feeling for science and set up experiment I think that be the way everybody have always think I think that anybody with any brain will do it that way it be not true I mean there be a lot of person you know I be one of that scientist that be get into trouble the other night at dinner because of the post modernism thing and I do not mean you know where be that lady audience here laughter KM I mean I do not really think of that as a argument so much as just a lively discussion I do not take it personally but I just I have I naively have think until this surfing experience start I into the 17th century I have think that be just the way person think and everybody do and they recognize reality by what they could see or touch or feel or hear at any rate when I be a boy I like for instance I have this I get this little book from Fort Sill Oklahoma this be about the time that George Dyson dad be start to blow nuclear thinking about blow up nuclear rocket and stuff I be think about make my own little rocket and I know that frog little frog have aspiration of space travel just like person and I laughter I be look for a a propulsion system that would like make a rocket like maybe about four foot high go up a couple of mile and I mean that be my sort of goal I want it to go out of sight and then I want this little parachute to come back with the frog in it and I I I get this book from Fort Sill Oklahoma where there be a missile base they send it out for amateur rocketeer and it say in there do not ever heat a mixture of potassium perchlorate and sugar laughter you know that be what you call a lead laughter you sort of now you say well let see if I can get hold of some potassium chlorate and sugar perchlorate and sugar and heat it it would be interesting to see what it be they do not want I to do and what it be go to and how be it go to work and we do not have like my mother preside over the back yard from a upstairs window where she would be iron or something like that and she be usually just sort of keep a eye on and if there be any puff of smoke out there she would lean out and admonish we all not to blow we eye out that be she you know that be kind of the bad thing that could happen to we that be why I think as long as I do not blow my eye out I may not care about the fact that it be prohibit from heat this solution I be go to do it carefully but I will do it it be like anything else that be prohibit you do it behind the garage laughter so I go to the drug store and I try to buy some potassium perchlorate and it be not unreasonable then for a kid to walk into a drug store and buy chemical nowadays it be no ma be check you shoe and like laughter but then it be not they do not have any but the guy have I say what kind of salt of potassium do you have you know and he have potassium nitrate and I say that might do the same thing whatever it be I be sure it be get to do with rocket or it would not be in that manual and so I I do some experiment you know I start off with little tiny amount of potassium nitrate and sugar which be readily available and I mix it in different proportion and I try to light it on fire just to see what would happen if you mix it together and it they burn it burn kind of slow but it make a nice smell compare to other rocket fuel I have try that all have sulfur in they and it smell like burn candy and then I try the melting business and I melt it and then it melt into a little sort of syrupy liquid brown and then it cool down to a brick hard substance that when you light that it go off like a bat I mean the little bowl of that stuff that have cool down you would light it and it would just start dance around the yard and I say there be a way to get a frog up to where he want to go laughter so I start develop you know George dad have a lot of help I just have my brother but I it take I about it take I about I would say six month to finally figure out all the little thing there be a lot of little thing involve in make a rocket that it will actually work even after you have the fuel but you do it by what I just you know you do experiment and you write down thing sometimes you make observation you know and then you slowly build up a theory of how this stuff work and it be I be follow all the rule I do not know what the rule be I be a natural bear scientist I guess or some kind of a throwback to the 17th century whatever but at any rate we finally do have a device that would reproduceably put a frog out of sight and get he back alive and we have not I mean we be not frighten by it we should have be because it make a lot of smoke and it make a lot of noise and it be powerful you know and once in a while they would blow up but I be not worry by the way about you know the explosion cause the destruction of the planet I have not hear about the 10 way that we should be afraid of the by the way I could have think I would better not do this because they say not to you know and I would well get permission from the government if I would have wait around for that I would have never the frog would have die you know at any rate I bring it up because it be a good story and he say tell personal thing you know and that be a personal i be go to tell you about the first night that I meet my wife but that would be too personal would not it so so I have get something else that be not personal but that process be what I think of as science see where you start with some idea and then instead of like look up every authority that you have ever hear of I sometimes you do that if you be go to write a paper later you want to figure out who else have work on it but in the actual process you get a idea like when I get the idea one night that I could amplify dna with two oligonucleotide and I could make lot of copy of some little piece of dna you know the thinking for that be about 20 minute while I be drive my car and then instead of go I go back and I do talk to person about it but if I have listen to what I hear from all my friend who be molecular biologist I would have abandon it you know if I have go back look for a authority figure who could tell I if it would work or not he would have say no it probably will not because the result of it be so spectacular that if it work it be go to change everybody goddamn way of do molecular biology nobody want a chemist to come in and poke around in they stuff like that and change thing but if you go to authority and you always do not you do not always get the right answer see but I know you would go into the lab and you would try to make it work yourself and then you be the authority and you can say I know it work because right there in that tube be where it happen and here on this gel there be a little band there that I know that be dna and that be the dna I want to amplify so there so it do work you know that be how you do science and then you say well what can make it work well and then you figure out good and good way to do it but you always work from from like fact that you have make available to you by do experiment thing that you could do on a stage and no tricky shit behind the thing I mean it be all you have get to be very honest with what you be do if it really be go to work I mean you can not make up result and then do another experiment base on that one so you have to be honest and I be basically honest I have a fairly bad memory and dishonesty would always get I in trouble if I like so I have just sort of be naturally honest and naturally inquisitive and that sort of lead to that kind of science now let see I have get another five minute right ok all scientist be not like that you know and there be a lot laughter there be a lot a lot have be go on since Isaac Newton and all that stuff happen one of the thing that happen right around World War II in that same time period before and as sure as hell afterwards government get realize that scientist be not strange dude that you know hide in ivory tower and do ridiculous thing with test tube scientist you know make World War II as we know it quite possible they make fast thing they make big gun to shoot they down with you know they make drug to give the pilot if they be break up in the process they make all kind of and then finally one giant bomb to end the whole thing right and everybody step back a little and say you know we ought to invest in this shit because whoever have get the most of this person work in the place be go to have a dominant position at least in the military and probably in all kind of economic way and they get involve in it and the scientific and industrial establishment be bear and out of that come a lot of scientist who be in there for the money you know because it be suddenly available and they be not the curious little boy that like to put frog up in the air they be the same person that later go in to medical school you know because there be money in it you know I mean later then they all get into business I mean there be wave of go into you high school person say you want to be rich you know be a scientist you know not anymore you want to be rich you be a businessman but a lot of person get in it for the money and the power and the travel that be back when travel be easy and that person do not think they do not they do not always tell you the truth you know there be nothing in they contract in fact that make it to they advantage always to tell you the truth and the person I be talk about be person that like they say that they be a member of the committee call say the Inter Governmental Panel on Climate Change and they and they have this big meeting where they try to figure out how we be go to how we be go to continually prove that the planet be get warm when that be actually contrary to most person sensation I mean if you actually measure the temperature over a period I mean the temperature have be measure now pretty carefully for about 50 60 year long than that it be be measure but in really nice precise way and record have be keep for 50 or 60 year and in fact the temperature have not really go up it be like the average temperature have go up a tiny little bit because the nighttime temperature at the weather station have come up just a little bit but there be a good explanation for that and it be that the weather station be all build outside of town where the airport be and now the town move out there there be concrete all around and they call it the skyline effect and most responsible person that measure temperature realize you have to shield you measure device from that and even then you know because the building get warm in the daytime and they keep it a little warm at night so the temperature have be sort of inch up it should have be but not a lot not like you know the first guy the first guy that get the idea that we be go to fry ourselves here actually he do not think of it that way he name be Sven Arrhenius he be Swedish and he say if you double the co2 level in the atmosphere which he think might this be in 1900 the temperature ought to go up about 5 5 degree he calculate he be think of the earth as kind of like you know like a completely insulated thing with no stuff in it really just energy come down energy leave and so he come up with this theory and he say this will be cool because it will be a long grow season in Sweden you know and the surfer like it the surfer think that be a cool idea because it be pretty cold in the ocean sometimes and but a lot of other person later on start think it would be bad you know but nobody actually demonstrate it right I mean the temperature as measure and you can find this on we wonderful internet you just go and look for all nasa record and all the Weather Bureau record and you will look at it yourself and you will see the temperature have just the nighttime temperature measure on the surface of the planet have go up a tiny little bit so if you just average that and the daytime temperature it look like it go up about 7 degree in this century but in fact it be just come up it be the nighttime the daytime temperature do not go up so and Arrhenius theory and all the global warm think they would say yeah it should go up in the daytime too if it be the greenhouse effect now person like thing that have like name like that that they can envision it right I mean but person do not like thing like this so most I mean you do not get all excited about thing like the actual evidence you know which would be evidence for strengthening of the tropical circulation in the 1990 it be a paper that come out in February and most of you probably have not hear about it evidence for large decadal variability in the Tropical Mean Radiative Energy Budget excuse I that paper be publish by NASA and some scientist at Columbia and Viliki and a whole bunch of person Princeton and that two paper come out in Science Magazine February the first and this the conclusion in both of this paper and in also the Science editor like description of this paper for you know for the quickie be that we theory about global warming be completely wrong I mean what this guy be do and this be what the NASA person have be say this for a long time they say if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere it be not go up it be not go up at all we have do it very carefully now for 20 year from satellite and it be not go up and in this paper they show something much more striking and that be that they do what they call a radiation and I be not go to go into the detail of it actually it be quite complicated but it be not as complicate as they might make you think it be by the word they use in that paper if you really get down to it they say the sun put out a certain amount of energy we know how much that be it fall on the earth the earth give back a certain amount when it get warm it generate it make red energy I mean like infra red like something that be warm give off infra red the whole business of the global warming trash really be that if the if there be too much co2 in the atmosphere the heat that be try to escape will not be able to get out but the heat come from the sun which be mostly down in the it be like 350 nanometer which be where it be center that go right through co2 so you still get heat but you do not dissipate any well this guy measure all of that thing I mean you can talk about that stuff and you can write this large report and you can get government money to do it but this they actually measure it and it turn out that in the last 10 year that be why they say decadal there that the energy that the level of what they call imbalance have be way the hell over what be expect like the amount of imbalance mean heat come in and it be not go out that you would get from have double the co2 which we be not anywhere near that by the way but if we do in 2025 or something have double the co2 as we have in 1900 they say it would be increase the energy budget by about in other word one watt per square centimeter more would be come in than go out so the planet should get warm well they find out in this study this two study by two different team that five and a half watt per square meter have be come in from 1998 1999 and the place do not get warm so the theory kaput it be nothing this paper should have be call the end to the global warming Fiasco you know they be concerned and you can tell they have very guard conclusion in this paper because they be talk about big laboratory that be fund by lot of money and by scared person you know if they say you know what there be not a problem with global warming any long so we can you know they be fund and if you start a grant request with something like that and say global warming obviously have not happen if they if they if they actually if they actually say that I be get out laughter I will stand up too and laughter applause they have to say that they have to be very cautious but what I be say be you can be delighted because the editor of Science who be no dummy and both of this fairly professional really professional team have really come to the same conclusion and in the bottom line in they paper they have to say what this mean be that what we have be think be the global circulation model that we predict that the earth be go to get overheate that it be all wrong it be wrong by a large factor it be not by a small one they just they just misinterpret the fact that the earth there be obviously some mechanism go on that nobody know about because the heat come in and it be not get warm so the planet be a pretty amazing thing you know it be big and horrible and big and wonderful and it do all kind of thing we do not know anything about so I mean the reason I put that thing all together ok here be the way you be suppose to do science some science be do for other reason and just curiosity and there be a lot of thing like global warming and ozone hole and you know a whole bunch of scientific public issue that if you be interested in they then you have to get down the detail and read the paper call large decadal variability in the you have to figure out what all that word mean and if you just listen to the guy who be hype that issue and make a lot of money out of it you will be misinform and you will be worry about the wrong thing remember the 10 thing that be go to get you the one of they laughter and the asteroid be the one I really agree with there I mean you have get to watch out for asteroid ok thank you for have I here applause
