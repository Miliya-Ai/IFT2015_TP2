my mission in life since I be a kid be and be to take the rest of you into space it be during we lifetime that we be go to take the Earth take the person of Earth and transition off permanently and that be exciting in fact I think it be a moral imperative that we open the space frontier you know it be the first time that we be go to have a chance to have planetary redundancy a chance to if you would back up the biosphere and if you think about space everything we hold of value on this planet metal and mineral and real estate and energy be in infinite quantity in space in fact the Earth be a crumb in a supermarket fill with resource the analogy for I be Alaska you know we buy Alaska we American buy Alaska in the 1850 it be call Seward folly we value it as the number of seal pelt we could kill and then we discover this thing gold and oil and fishing and timber and it become you know a trillion dollar economy and now we take we honeymoon there the same thing will happen in space we be on the verge of the great exploration that the human race have ever know we explore for three reason the weak of which be curiosity you know it be fund NASA budget up until now some image from Mars 1997 in fact I think in the next decade without any question we will discover life on Mars and find that it be literally ubiquitous under the soil and different part of that planet the strong motivator the much strong motivator be fear it drive we to the moon we literally in fear with the Soviet Union race to the moon and we have this huge rock you know killer sized rock in the hundred of thousand or million out there and while the probability be very small the impact figure in literally of one of this hit the Earth be so huge that to spend a small fraction look search prepare to defend be not unreasonable and of course the third motivator one near and dear to my heart as a entrepreneur be wealth in fact the great wealth if you think about this other asteroid there be a class of the nickel iron which in platinum group metal market alone be worth something like 20 trillion dollar if you can go out and grab one of this rock my plan be to actually buy put on the precious metal market and then actually claim that I be go to go out and get one and that will fund the actual mission to go and get one but fear curiosity and greed have drive we and for I this be I be the short kid on the right this be my motivation be actually during Apollo and Apollo be one of the great motivator ever if you think about what happen at the turn of early 1960 on May 25 JFK say we be go to go to the moon and person leave they job and they go to obscure location to go and be part of this amazing mission and we know nothing about go to space we go from have literally put Alan Shepard in suborbital flight to go to the moon in eight year and the average age of the person that get we there be 26 year old they do not know what could not be do they have to make up everything and that my friend be amazing motivation this be Gene Cernan a good friend of mine say if I can go to the moon this be the last human on the moon so far nothing nothing be impossible but of course we have think about the government always as the person take we there but I put forward here the government be not go to get we there the government be unable to take the risk require to open up this precious frontier the shuttle be cost a billion dollar a launch that be a pathetic number it be unreasonable we should not be happy in stand for that one of the thing that we do with the Ansari X prize be take the challenge on that risk be ok you know as we be go out there and take on a new frontier we should be allow to risk in fact anyone who say we should not you know just need to be put aside because as we go forward in fact the great discovery we will ever know be ahead of we the entrepreneur in the space business be the furry mammal and clearly the industrial military complex with Boeing and Lockheed and NASA be the dinosaur the ability for we to access this resource to gain planetary redundancy we can now gather all the information the genetic code you know everything store on we database and back they up off the planet in case there would be one of that disastrous situation the difficulty be get there and clearly the cost to orbit be key once you be in orbit you be two third of the way energetically to anywhere the moon to Mars and today there be only three vehicle the U S shuttle the Russian Soyuz and the Chinese vehicle that get you there arguably it be about 100 million dollar a person on the space shuttle one of the company I start Space Adventures will sell you a ticket we have do two so far we will be announce two more on the Soyuz to go up to the space station for 20 million dollar but that be expensive and to understand what the potential be laughter it be expensive but person be willing to pay that you know one we have a very unique period in time today for the first time ever we have enough wealth concentrate in the hand of few individual and the technology accessible that will allow we to really drive space exploration but how cheap could it get I want to give you the end point we know 20 million dollar today you can go and buy a ticket but how cheap could it get let go back to high school physics here if you calculate the amount of potential energy mgh to take you and you spacesuit up to a couple hundred mile and then you accelerate yourself to 17 500 mile per hour remember that one half MV square and you figure it out it be about 5 7 gigajoule of energy if you expend that over a hour it be about 1 6 megawatt if you go to one of Vijay micro power source and they sell it to you for seven cent a kilowatt hour anybody here fast in math how much will it cost you and you spacesuit to go to orbit 100 buck that be the price improvement curve that we need some breakthrough in physics along the way I will grant you that laughter but guy if history have teach we anything it be that if you can imagine it you will get there eventually I have no question that the physics the engineering to get we down to the point where all of we can afford orbital space flight be around the corner the difficulty be that there need to be a real marketplace to drive the investment today the Boeings and the Lockheeds do not spend a dollar of they own money in r d it be all government research dollar and very few of that and in fact the large corporation the government can not take the risk so we need what I call a exothermic economic reaction in space today commercial market worldwide global commercial launch market 12 to 15 launch per year number of commercial company out there 12 to 15 company one per company that be not it there be only one marketplace and I call they self loading carbon payload they come with they own money they be easy to make it be person the Ansari X prize be my solution read about Lindbergh for create the vehicle to get we there we offer 10 million dollar in cash for the first reusable ship carry three person up to 100 kilometer come back down and within two week make the trip again twenty six team from seven country enter the competition spending between one to 25 million dollar each and of course we have beautiful SpaceShipOne which make that two flight and win the competition and I would like to take you there to that morning for just a quick video video pilot release we fire Richard Searfoss Good luck applause rs we have get a altitude call of 368 000 foot applause rs so in my official capacity as the chief judge of the Ansari X prize competition I declare that Mojave Aerospace Ventures have indeed earn the Ansari X prize applause Peter Diamandis probably the most difficult thing that I have to do be raise the capital for this it be literally impossible we go I go to 100 200 ceo cmo no one believe it be do everyone say oh what do NASA think well person be go to die how can you possibly go to put this forward I find a visionary family the Ansari family and Champ Car and raise part of the money but not the full 10 million and what I end up do be go out to the insurance industry and buy a hole in one insurance policy see the insurance company go to Boeing and Lockheed and say be you go to compete no be you go to compete no no one be go to win this thing so they take a bet that no one would win by January of 05 and I take a bet that someone would win applause so and the good thing be they pay off and the check do not bounce laughter we have have a lot of accomplishment and it be be a tremendous success one of the thing I be most happy about be that the SpaceShipOne be go to hang in Air and Space Museum next to the Spirit of St Louis and the Wright Flyer be not that great applause so a little bit about the future step to space what be available for you today you can go and experience weightless flight by 08 suborbital flight the price tag for that you know on virgin be go to be about 200 000 there be three or four other serious effort that will bring the price down very rapidly I think to about 25 000 dollar for a suborbital flight Orbital flight we can take you to the space station and then I truly believe once a group be in orbit around the Earth I know if they do not do it I be we be go to stockpile some fuel make a beeline for the moon and grab some real estate laughter quick moment for the designer in the audience we spend 11 year get FAA approval to do zero gravity flight here be some fun image here be Burt Rutan and my good friend Greg Meronek inside a zero gravity person think a zero gravity room there be a switch on there that turn it off but it be actually parabolic flight of a airplane and turn out 7 up have just do a little commercial that be air this month if we can get the audio up Video Narrator for a chance to win the first free ticket to space look for specially marked package of Diet 7 up when you want the taste that will not weigh you down the only way to go be up pd that be film inside we airplane and so you can now do this we be base down in Florida let I talk about the other thing I be excited about the future of prize you know prize be a very old idea I have the pleasure of borrowing from the Longitude Prize and the Orteig Prize that put Lindbergh forward and we have make a decision in the x prize Foundation to actually carry that concept forward into other technology area and we just take on a new mission statement to bring about radical breakthrough in space and other technology for the benefit of humanity and this be something that we be very excited about I show this slide to Larry Page who just join we board and you know when you give to a nonprofit you might have 50 cent on the dollar if you have a matching grant it be typically two or three to one if you put up a prize you can get literally a 50 to one leverage on you dollar and that be huge and then he turn around and say well if you back a prize institute that run a 10 prize you get 500 to one I say well that be great so we have actually be look to turn the x prize into a world class prize institute this be what happen when you put up a prize when you announce it and team start to begin do trial you get publicity increase and when it be win publicity shoot through the roof if it be properly manage and that be part of the benefit to a sponsor then when the prize be actually win after it be move you get societal benefit you know new technology new capability and the benefit to the sponsor be the sum of the publicity and societal benefit over the long term that be we value proposition in a prize if you be go to go and try to create SpaceShipOne or any kind of a new technology you have to fund that from the beginning and maintain that funding with a uncertain outcome it may or may not happen but if you put up a prize the beautiful thing be you know it be a very small maintenance fee and you pay on success Orteig do not pay a dime out to the nine team that go across try to go across the Atlantic and we do not pay a dime until someone win the Ansari X prize so prize work great you know innovator the entrepreneur out there you know that when you be go for a goal the first thing you have to do be believe that you can do it yourself then you have get to you know face potential public ridicule of that be a crazy idea it will never work and then you have to convince other so that they can in fact help you raise the fund and then you have get to deal with the fact that you have get government bureaucracy and institution that do not want you to move that thing forward and you have to deal with failure what a prize do what we have experience a prize do be literally help to short circuit or support all of this thing because a prize credentials the idea that this be a good idea well it must be a good idea someone offer 10 million dollar to go and do this thing and each of this area be something that we find the Ansari X prize help short circuit this for innovation so as a organization we put together a prize discovery process of how to come up with prize and write the rule and we be actually look at create prize in a number of different category we be look at attack energy environment nanotechnology and I will talk about that more in a moment and the way we be do that be we be create prize team within the x prize we have a space prize team we be go after a orbital prize we be look at a number of energy prize Craig Venter have just join we board and we be do a rapid genome sequencing prize with he we will be announce later this fall about imagine be able to sequence anybody dna for under 1 000 dollar revolutionize medicine and clean water education medicine and even look at social entrepreneurship so my final slide here be the most critical tool for solve humanity grand challenge it be not technology it be not money it be only one thing it be the committed passionate human mind applause
