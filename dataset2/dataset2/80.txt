at the break I be ask by several person about my comment about the aging debate and this will be my only comment on it and that be I understand that optimist greatly outlive pessimist laughter what I be go to tell you about in my 18 minute be how we be about to switch from read the genetic code to the first stage of begin to write the code ourselves it be only 10 year ago this month when we publish the first sequence of a free living organism that of haemophilus influenza that take a genome project from 13 year down to four month we can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hour so in the last decade a large number of genome have be add most human pathogen a couple of plant several insect and several mammal include the human genome Genomics at this stage of the thinking from a little over 10 year ago be by the end of this year we might have between three and five genome sequence it be on the order of several hundred we just get a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to sequence 130 genome this year as a side project from environmental organism so the rate of read the genetic code have change but as we look what be out there we have barely scratch the surface on what be available on this planet most person do not realize it because they be invisible but microbe make up about a half of the Earth biomass whereas all animal only make up about one one thousandth of all the biomass and maybe it be something that person in Oxford do not do very often but if you ever make it to the sea and you swallow a mouthful of seawater keep in mind that each milliliter have about a million bacterium and on the order of 10 million virus less than 5 000 microbial species have be characterize as of two year ago and so we decide to do something about it and we start the Sorcerer II expedition where we be as with great oceanographic expedition try to sample the ocean every 200 mile we start in Bermuda for we test project then move up to Halifax work down the U S East Coast the Caribbean Sea the Panama Canal through to the Galapagos then across the Pacific and we be in the process now of work we way across the Indian Ocean it be very tough duty we be do this on a sailing vessel in part to help excite young person about go into science the experiment be incredibly simple we just take seawater and we filter it and we collect different size organism on different filter and then take they dna back to we lab in Rockville where we can sequence a hundred million letter of the genetic code every 24 hour and with do this we have make some amazing discovery for example it be think that the visual pigment that be in we eye there be only one or two organism in the environment that have this same pigment it turn out almost every species in the upper part of the ocean in warm part of the world have this same photoreceptor and use sunlight as the source of they energy and communication from one site from one barrel of seawater we discover 1 3 million new gene and as many as 50 000 new species we have extend this to the air now with a grant from the Sloan Foundation we be measure how many virus and bacterium all of we be breathe in and out every day particularly on airplane or close auditorium laughter we filter through some simple apparatus we collect on the order of a billion microbe from just a day filter on top of a building in New York City and we be in the process of sequencing all that at the present time just on the datum collection side just where we be through the Galapagos we be find that almost every 200 mile we see tremendous diversity in the sample in the ocean some of this make logical sense in term of different temperature gradient so this be a satellite photograph base on temperature red be warm blue be cold and we find there be a tremendous difference between the warm water sample and the cold water sample in term of abundant species the other thing that surprise we quite a bit be this photoreceptor detect different wavelength of light and we can predict that base on they amino acid sequence and this vary tremendously from region to region maybe not surprisingly in the deep ocean where it be mostly blue the photoreceptor tend to see blue light when there be a lot of chlorophyll around they see a lot of green light but they vary even more possibly move towards infrared and ultraviolet in the extreme just to try and get a assessment of what we gene repertoire be we assemble all the datum include all of ours thus far from the expedition which represent more than half of all the gene datum on the planet and it total around 29 million gene and we try to put this into gene family to see what this discovery be be we just discover new member of know family or be we discover new family and it turn out we have about 50 000 major gene family but every new sample we take in the environment add in a linear fashion to this new family so we be at the early stage of discovery about basic gene component and life on this planet when we look at the so call evolutionary tree we be up on the upper right hand corner with the animal of that roughly 29 million gene we only have around 24 000 in we genome and if you take all animal together we probably share less than 30 000 and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene family I view that this gene be now not only the design component of evolution and we think in a gene centric view maybe go back to Richard Dawkins idea than in a genome centric view which be different construct of this gene component synthetic dna the ability to synthesize dna have change at sort of the same pace that dna sequencing have over the last decade or two and be get very rapid and very cheap we first think about synthetic genomic come when we sequence the second genome back in 1995 and that from mycoplasma genitalium and we have really nice t shirt that say you know I heart my genitalium this be actually just a microorganism but it have roughly 500 gene haemophilus have 1 800 gene and we simply ask the question if one species need 800 another 500 be there a small set of gene that might comprise a minimal operating system so we start do transposon mutagenesis transposon be just small piece of dna that randomly insert in the genetic code and if they insert in the middle of the gene they disrupt its function so we make a map of all the gene that could take transposon insertion and we call that non essential gene but it turn out the environment be very critical for this and you can only define a essential or non essential gene base on exactly what be in the environment we also try to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genome of 13 relate organism and we try to compare all of that to see what they have in common and we get this overlap circle and we find only 173 gene common to all 13 organism the pool expand a little bit if we ignore one intracellular parasite it expand even more when we look at core set of gene of around 310 or so so we think that we can expand or contract genome depend on you point of view here to maybe 300 to 400 gene from the minimal of 500 the only way to prove this idea be to construct a artificial chromosome with that gene in they and we have to do this in a cassette base fashion we find that synthesize accurate dna in large piece be extremely difficult Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison my colleague on this develop a exciting new method that allow we to synthesize a 5 000 base pair virus in only a two week period that be 100 percent accurate in term of its sequence and its biology it be a quite exciting experiment when we just take the synthetic piece of dna inject it in the bacterium and all of a sudden that dna start drive the production of the virus particle that turn around and then kill the bacterium this be not the first synthetic virus a polio virus have be make a year before but it be only one ten thousandth as active and it take three year to do this be a cartoon of the structure of phi X 174 this be a case where the software now build its own hardware and that be the notion that we have with biology person immediately jump to concern about biological warfare and I have recent testimony before a Senate committee and a special committee the U S government have set up to review this area and I think it be important to keep reality in mind versus what happen with person imagination basically any virus that be be sequence today that genome can be make and person immediately freak out about thing about Ebola or smallpox but the dna from this organism be not infective so even if somebody make the smallpox genome that dna itself would not cause infection the real concern that security department have be designer virus and there be only two country the U S and the former Soviet Union that have major effort on try to create biological warfare agent if that research be truly discontinue there should be very little activity on the know how to make designer virus in the future I think single cell organism be possible within two year and possibly eukaryotic cell that that we have be possible within a decade so we be now make several dozen different construct because we can vary the cassette and the gene that go into this artificial chromosome the key be how do you put all of the other we start with this fragment and then we have a homologous recombination system that reassemble that into a chromosome this be derive from a organism deinococcus radiodurans that can take three million rad of radiation and not be kill it reassemble its genome after this radiation burst in about 12 to 24 hour after its chromosome be literally blow apart this organism be ubiquitous on the planet and exist perhaps now in outer space due to all we travel there this be a glass beaker after about half a million rad of radiation the glass start to burn and crack while the microbe sit in the bottom just get happy and happy here be a actual picture of what happen the top of this show the genome after 1 7 million rad of radiation the chromosome be literally blow apart and here be that same dna automatically reassemble 24 hour later it be truly stunning that this organism can do that and we probably have thousand if not ten of thousand of different species on this planet that be capable of do that after this genome be synthesize the first step be just transplant they into a cell without a genome so we think synthetic cell be go to have tremendous potential not only for understand the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and society issue for example from the third organism we sequence Methanococcus jannaschii it live in boil water temperature its energy source be hydrogen and all its carbon come from co2 it capture back from the environment so we know lot of different pathway thousand of different organism now that live off of co2 and can capture that back so instead of use carbon from oil for synthetic process we have the chance of use carbon and capture it back from the atmosphere convert that into biopolymer or other product we have one organism that live off of carbon monoxide and we use as a reduce power to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen also there be numerous pathway that can be engineer metabolize methane and DuPont have a major program with Statoil in Norway to capture and convert the methane from the gas field there into useful product within a short while I think there be go to be a new field call Combinatorial Genomics because with this new synthesis capability this vast gene array repertoire and the homologous recombination we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosome a day and therefore as with all biology you get selection through screening whether you be screen for hydrogen production or chemical production or just viability to understand the role of this gene be go to be well within reach we be try to modify photosynthesis to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight photosynthesis be modulate by oxygen and we have a oxygen insensitive hydrogenase that we think will totally change this process we be also combine cellulase the enzyme that break down complex sugar into simple sugar and fermentation in the same cell for produce ethanol Pharmaceutical production be already under way in major laboratory use microbe the chemistry from compound in the environment be order of magnitude more complex than we good chemist can produce I think future engineer species could be the source of food hopefully a source of energy environmental remediation and perhaps replace the petrochemical industry let I just close with ethical and policy study we delay the start of we experiment in 1999 until we complete a year and a half bioethical review as to whether we should try and make a artificial species every major religion participate in this it be actually a very strange study because the various religious leader be use they scripture as law book and they could not find anything in they prohibit make life so it must be ok the only ultimate concern be biological warfare aspect of this but give we the go ahead to start this experiment for the reason we be do they right now the Sloan Foundation have just fund a multi institutional study on this to work out what the risk and benefit to society be and the rule that scientific team such as my own should be use in this area and we be try to set good example as we go forward this be complex issue except for the threat of bio terrorism they be very simple issue in term of can we design thing to produce clean energy perhaps revolutionize what develop country can do and provide through various simple process thank you very much
