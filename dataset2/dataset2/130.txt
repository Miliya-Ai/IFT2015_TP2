I just hear the good joke about bond Emeruwa I be have lunch with he just a few minute ago and a Nigerian journalist come and this will only make sense if you have ever watch a James Bond movie and a Nigerian journalist come up to he and go aha we meet again Mr bond laughter it be great so I have get a little sheet of paper here mostly because I be Nigerian and if you leave I alone I will talk for like two hour I just want to say good afternoon good evening it be be a incredible few day it be downhill from now on I want to thank Emeka and Chris but also most importantly all the invisible person behind TED that you just see flit around the whole place that have make sort of this space for such a diverse and robust conversation it be really amazing I have be in the audience I be a writer and I have be watch person with the slide show and scientist and banker and I have be feel a bit like a gangsta rapper at a bar mitzvah laughter like what have I get to say about all this and I be watch Jane Goodall yesterday and I think it be really great and I be watch that incredible slide of the chimpanzee and I think wow what if a chimpanzee could talk you know what would it say my first thought be well you know there be George Bush but then I think why be rude to chimpanzee I guess there go my green card laughter there be be a lot of talk about narrative in Africa and what be become increasingly clear to I be that we be talk about news story about Africa we be not really talk about African narrative and it be important to make a distinction because if the news be anything to go by 40 percent of American can not either can not afford health insurance or have the most inadequate health insurance and have a president who despite the protest of million of he citizen even he own Congress continue to prosecute a senseless war so if news be anything to go by the U S be right there with Zimbabwe right which it be not really be it and talk about war my girlfriend have this great t shirt that say bomb for peace be like fuck for virginity it be amazing be not it the truth be everything we know about America everything American come to know about be American be not from the news I live there we do not go home at the end of the day and think well I really know who I be now because the Wall Street Journal say that the Stock Exchange close at this many point what we know about how to be who we be come from story it come from the novel the movie the fashion magazine it come from popular culture in other word it be the agent of we imagination who really shape who we be and this be important to remember because in Africa the complicated question we want to ask about what all of this means have be ask from the rock painting of the San person through the Sundiata epic of Mali to modern contemporary literature if you want to know about Africa read we literature and not just thing fall apart because that would be like say I have read go with the wind and so I know everything about America that be very important there be a poem by Jack Gilbert call the Forgotten dialect of the heart he say when the sumerian tablet be first translate they be think to be business record but what if they be poem and psalm my love be like twelve Ethiopian goat stand still in the morning light shipload of thuja be what my body want to say to you body giraffe be this desire in the dark this be important it be important because misread be really the chance for complication and opportunity the first Igbo Bible be translate from English in about the 1800 by Bishop Crowther who be a Yoruba and it be important to know igbo be a tonal language and so they will say the word igwe and igwe same spelling one mean sky or heaven and one mean bicycle or iron so God be in heaven surround by he angel be translate as Igbo and for some reason in Cameroon when they try to translate the Bible into Cameroonian patois they choose the Igbo version and I be not go to give you the patois translation I be go to make it standard English basically it end up as God be on a bicycle with he angel this be good because language complicate thing you know we often think that language mirror the world in which we live and I find that be not true the language actually make the world in which we live Language be not I mean thing do not have any mutable value by themselves we ascribe they a value and language can not be understand in its abstraction it can only be understand in the context of story and everything all of this be story and it be important to remember that because if we do not then we become ahistorical we have have a lot of a parade of amazing idea here but this be not new to Africa Nigeria get its independence in 1960 the first time the possibility for independence be discuss be in 1922 follow the Aba woman market riot in 1967 in the middle of the biafran Nigerian civil war Dr Njoku Obi invent the Cholera vaccine so you know the thing be to remember that because otherwise 10 year from now we will be back here try to tell this story again so what it say to I then be that it be not really the problem be not really the story that be be tell or which story be be tell the problem really be the term of humanity that we be willing to bring to complicate every story and that be really what it be all about let I tell you a Nigerian joke well it be just a joke anyway so there be Tom Dick and Harry and they be work construction and Tom open up he lunch box and there be rice in it and he go on this rant about twenty year my wife have be pack rice for lunch if she do it again tomorrow I be go to throw myself off this building and kill myself and Dick and Harry repeat this the next day Tom open he lunchbox there be rice so he throw himself off and kill himself and Tom Dick and Harry follow and now the inquest you know Tom wife and Dick wife be distraught they wish they have not pack rice but Harry wife be confuse because she say you know Harry have be pack he own lunch for 20 year laughter this seemingly innocent joke when I hear it as a child in Nigeria be tell about Igbo Yoruba and Hausa with the Hausa be Harry so what seem like a eccentric if tragic joke about Harry become a way to spread ethnic hatred my father be educate in cork in the University of Cork in the 50 in fact every time I read in Ireland person get I all mistaken and they say oh this be Chris O Barney from Cork but he be also in Oxford in the 50 and yet grow up as a child in Nigeria my father use to say to I you must never eat or drink in a Yoruba person house because they will poison you it make sense now when I think about it because if you would know my father you would have want to poison he too laughter so I be bear in 1966 at the beginning of the biafran Nigerian civil war and the war end after three year and I be grow up in school and the federal government do not want we teach about the history of the war because they think it probably would make we generate a new generation of rebel so I have a very inventive teacher a Pakistani Muslim who want to teach we about this so what he do be to teach we Jewish Holocaust history and so huddle around book with photograph of person in Auschwitz I learn the melancholic history of my person through the melancholic history of another person I mean picture this really picture this a Pakistani Muslim teaching Jewish holocaust history to young igbo child story be powerful story be fluid and it belong to nobody and it should come as no surprise that my first novel at 16 be about neo Nazi take over Nigeria to institute the Fourth Reich it make perfect sense and they be to blow up strategic target and take over the country and they be foil by a Nigerian James Bond call Coyote Williams and a Jewish Nazi hunter and it happen over four continent and when the book come out I be herald as Africa answer to Frederick Forsyth which be a dubious honor at good but also the book be launch in time for I to be accuse of construct the blueprint for a foil coup attempt so at 18 I be bond off to prison in Nigeria I grow up very privileged and it be important to talk about privilege because we do not talk about it here a lot of we be very privileged I grow up servant car television all that stuff my story of Nigeria grow up be very different from the story I encounter in prison and I have no language for it I be completely terrified completely break and keep try to find a new language a new way to make sense of all of this six month after that with no explanation they let I go now for that of you who have see I at the buffet table know that it be because it be cost they too much to feed I laughter but I mean I grow up with this incredible privilege and not just i million of Nigerian grow up with book and library in fact we be talk last night about how all of the steamy novel of Harold Robbins have do more for sex education of horny teenage boy in Africa than any sex education program ever have all of that be go we be squander the most valuable resource we have on this continent the valuable resource of the imagination in the film sometimes in April by Raoul Peck Idris Elba be poise in a scene with he machete raise and he be be force by a crowd to chop up he good friend fellow Rwandan Army officer albeit a Tutsi play by Fraser James and Fraser on he knee arm tie behind he back and he be cry he be snivel it be a pitiful sight and as we watch it we be ashamed and we want to say to Idris chop he up shut he up and as Idris move Fraser scream stop please stop Idris pause then he move again and Fraser say please please stop and it be not the look of horror and terror on Fraser face that stop Idris or we it be the look in Fraser eye it be one that say do not do this and I be not say this to save myself although this would be nice I be do it to save you because if you do this you will be lose to be so afraid that you be stand in the face of a death you can not escape and that you be soil yourself and cry but to say in that moment as Fraser say to Idris tell my girlfriend I love she in that moment Fraser say I be lose already but not you not you this be a redemption we can all aspire to African narrative in the West they proliferate I really do not care anymore I be more interested in the story we tell about ourselves how as a writer I find that African writer have always be the curator of we humanity on this continent the question be how do I balance narrative that be wonderful with narrative of wound and self loathing and this be the difficulty that I face I be try to move beyond political rhetoric to a place of ethical questioning I be ask we to balance the idea of we complete vulnerability with the complete notion of transformation of what be possible as a young middle class Nigerian activist I launch myself along with a whole generation of we into the campaign to stop the government and I ask million of person without question my right to do so to go up against the government and I watch they be lock up in prison and tear gas I justify it and I say this be the cost of revolution have I not myself be imprison have I not myself be beat it be not until later when I be imprison again that I understand the real meaning of torture and how easy you humanity can be take from you for the time I be engage in war righteous righteous war excuse I sometimes I can stand before the world and when I say this transformation be a difficult and slow process sometimes I can stand before the world and say my name be Chris Abani I have be human six day but only sometimes but this be a good thing it be never go to be easy there be no answer as I be tell Rachel from Google Earth that I have challenge my student in America I say you do not know anything about Africa you be all idiot and so they say tell I about Africa Professor Abani so I go to Google Earth and learn about Africa and the truth be tell this be it be not it there be no essential African and most of we be as completely ignorant as everyone else about the continent we come from and yet we want to make profound statement about it and I think if we can just admit that we be all try to approximate the truth of we own community it will make for a much more nuanced and a much more interesting conversation I want to believe that we can be agnostic about this that we can rise above all of this when I be 10 I read James Baldwin another country and that book break I not because I be encounter homosexual sex and love for the first time but because the way James write about it make it impossible for I to attach otherness to it here Jimmy say here be love all of it the fact that it happen in another country take you quite by surprise my friend Ronald Gottesman say there be three kind of person in the world that who can count and that who can not laughter he also say that the cause of all we trouble be the belief in a essential pure identity religious ethnic historical ideological I want to leave you with a poem by Yusef Komunyakaa that speak to transformation it be call ode to the Drum and I will try and read it the way Yusef would be proud to hear it read Gazelle I kill you for you skin exquisite touch for how easy it be to be nail to a board weather raw as white butcher paper last night I hear my daughter pray for the meat here at my foot you know it be not anger that make I stop my heart till the hammer fall week ago you break I as a woman once shatter I into a song beneath she weight before you slouch into that grassy hush and now I be tighten lash shape in hide as if around a ribcage shape like five bowstr ghost can not slip back inside the body drum you have be season by wind dusk and sunlight pressure can make everything whole again brass nail tack into the ebony wood you face have be carve five time I have to drive trouble in the hill trouble in the valley and trouble by the river too there be no palm wine fish salt or calabash Kadoom Kadoom Kadoom Ka doooom now I have beat a song back into you rise and walk away like a panther thank you applause
