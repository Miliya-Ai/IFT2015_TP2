I want to argue to you that in fact politics and religion which be the two primary factor not the sole but overwhelmingly the primary factor which be drive towards a war which look extremely likely border on the inevitable at this point whether one be in favor of that or not that politics and religion be in fact themselves well conceptualize as kind of technology and subject to kind of question that we regularly consider in the space of conceptual design here be what I mean politics and let focus on the political system in particular question here which be the system of democracy democracy as a type of politics be a technology for the control and deployment of power you can deploy power in a wide range of way the famous one despotism be a good one anarchy be a way to not deploy the power in any organized way to do it in a radically diffused fashion and democracy be a set of technology which have the effect of in principle diffuse the power source to a large number of person and then be concentrate it in a small group of person who govern and who themselves be in principle authorize to govern by virtue of what the broad public have do now consider religion in this case Islam which be the religion that in some direct sense can be say to be precipitate what we be about to enter let I say parenthetically why I think that be the case because I think it be a potentially controversial statement I would put it in the follow equation no 9 11 no war at the beginning of the Bush administration when President Bush now President Bush be run for president he make it very clear that he be not interested in intervene broadly in the world in fact the trend be for disengagement with the rest of the world that be why we hear about the backing away from the Kyoto protocol for example after 9 11 the table be turn and the president decide with he advisor to undertake some kind of a active intervention in the world around we that begin with Afghanistan and when Afghanistan go extremely smoothly and quickly a decision be make through the technology of democracy again notice not a perfect technology but through the technology of democracy that this administration be go to push in the direction of another war this time a war in Iraq now the reason I begin by say no 9 11 no war be that we have to acknowledge that Islam as interpret by a very very small extremely radical group of person be a precipitate cause of the 9 11 attack the precipitate cause of the 9 11 attack and as a consequence at one degree of remove the precipitate cause of the come war that we be about to be engage in and I would add that bin Laden and he follower be consciously devote to the goal of create a conflict between democracy or at least capitalist democracy on the one hand and the world of Islam as they see and define it now how be Islam a technology in this conceptual apparatus well it be a technology for first salvation in its most basic sense it be mean to be a mechanism for construe the universe in a way that will bring about the salvation of the individual believer but it be also mean by the Islamists and I use that term to mean person who believe that Islam they follow the slogan Islam be the answer to a wide range of question whether they be social or political or personal or spiritual within the sphere of person who have that view and it be a large number of person in the Muslim world who disagree with bin Laden in he application but agree that Islam be the answer Islam represent a way of engage the world through which one can achieve certain desirable goal and the goal from the perspective of Muslim be in principle peace justice and equality but on term that correspond to traditional Muslim teaching now I do not want to leave a misimpression by identify either of this proposition rather either of this phenomenon democracy or Islam as technology I do not want to suggest that they be a single thing that you can point to and I think a good way to prove this be simply to demonstrate to you what my thought process be when decide what to put on the wall behind I when I speak and I run immediately into a conceptual problem you can not show a picture of democracy you can show a slogan or a symbol or a sign that stand for democracy you can show the Capitol I have the same problem when I be design the cover of my forthcoming book in fact what do you put on the cover to show democracy and the same problem with respect to Islam you can show a mosque or you can show worshipper but there be not a straightforward way of depict Islam that be because this be the kind of concept that be not susceptible to easy representation now it follow from that that they be deeply contestable it follow from that that all of the person in the world who say that they be Muslim can in principle subscribe to a wide range of different interpretation of what Islam really be and the same be true of democracy in other word unlike the word hope which one could look up in a dictionary and derive origin for and perhaps reach some kind of a consensual use analysis this be essentially contest concept they be idea about which person disagree in the deep possible sense and as a consequence of this disagreement it be very very difficult for anyone to say I have the right version of Islam you know post 9 11 we be treat to the amazing phenomenon of George W Bush say Islam mean peace well so say George W Bush other person would say it mean something else some person would say that Islam mean submission other person would say it mean a acknowledgement or recognition of God sovereignty there be a wide range of different thing that Islam can mean and ostensibly the same be true of democracy some person say that democracy consist basically in election other person say no that be not enough there have to be basic liberal right free speech free press equality of citizen this be contest point and it be impossible to answer they by say ah ha I look in the right place and I find out what this concept mean now if Islam and democracy be at present in a moment of great confrontation what do that mean well you could fit it into a range of different interpretative framework you could begin with the one that we begin with a couple of day ago which be fear fear be not a implausible reaction with a war just around the corner and with a very very high likelihood that many many person be go to die as a consequence of this confrontation a confrontation which many many person in the Muslim world do not want many many person in the American democracy do not want many person elsewhere in the world do not want but which nonetheless be favor by a large enough number of person at least in the relevant space which be the United States to actually go forward so fear be not a crazy response at all and I think that that be in fact probably the first appropriate response what I want to suggest to you though in the next couple of minute be that there be also a hopeful response to this and the hopeful response derive from recognize that Islam and democracy be technology and by virtue of be technology they be manipulable and they be manipulable in way that can produce some extremely positive outcome what do I have in mind well all over the Muslim world there be person who take Islam deeply seriously person who care about Islam for whom it be a source either of faith or of civilization or of deep value or just a source of powerful personal identity who think and be say loudly that Islam and democracy be in fact not in conflict but be in fact deeply compatible and this Muslim and it be the vast majority of Muslim disagree profoundly with bin Laden approach profoundly and they furthermore think overwhelmingly again one can not speak of every person but overwhelmingly and one can find this by read any of the source that they have produce and they be all over the internet and in all sort of language one can see that they be say that they concern in they own country be primarily to free up themselves to have choice in the sphere of personal life in the sphere of economics in the sphere of politics and yes in the sphere of religion which be itself closely regulate in most of the Muslim world and many of this Muslim further say that they disagreement with the United States be that it in the past and still in the present have side with autocratic ruler in the Muslim world in order to promote America short term interest now during the Cold War that may have be a defensible position for the United States to take that be a academic question it may be that there be a great war to be fight between West and East and it be necessary on the axis of democracy against communism and it be necessary in some way for this to contradict each other and as a consequence you have to make friend wherever you can get they but now that the Cold War be over there be nearly universal consensus in the Muslim world and pretty close to the same here in the United States if you talk to person and ask they that in principle there be no reason that democracy and Islam can not co exist and we see this among activist practical Muslim like the Muslim who be presently the elect parliamentary democratic government of Turkey who be behave pragmatically not ideologically who be promote they own religious value who be elect by they own person because they be perceive as honest and sincere because of they religious value but who do not think that Islam and a democratic system of governance be fundamentally incompatible now you may say but surely what we have see on television about Saudi Islam convince we that it can not possibly be compatible with what we consider the core of democracy namely free political choice basic liberty and basic equality but I be here to tell you that technology be more malleable than that I be here to tell you that many many Muslim believe the vast majority in fact in fact I think I would go so far as to say that many Muslim in Saudi Arabia believe that the core value of Islam namely acknowledgement of God sovereignty and basic human equality before God be themselves compatible with liberty equality and free political choice and there be Muslim many Muslim out there who be say precisely this and they be make this argument wherever they be permit to make it but they government needless to say be relatively threaten by this and for the most part try to stop they from make this argument so for example a group of young activist in Egypt try to form a party know as the Center Party which advocate the compatibility of Islam and democracy they be not even allow to form a party they be actually block from even form a party under the political system there why because they would have do extraordinarily well in the most recent election in the Muslim world which be that in Pakistan that in Morocco and that in Turkey in each case person who present themselves to the electorate as Islamic Democrat be far and away the most successful vote getter every place they be allow to run freely so in Morocco for example they finish third in the political race but they be only allow to contest half the seat so have they contest a large number of the seat they would have do even well now what I want to suggest to you be that the reason for hope in this case be that we be on the edge of a real transformation in the Muslim world and that be a transformation in which many sincerely believe Muslim who care very very deeply about they tradition who do not want to compromise that value believe through the malleability of the technology of democracy and the malleability and synthetic capability of the technology of Islam that this two idea can work together now what would that look like what do it mean to say that there be a Islamic democracy well one thing be it be not go to look identical to democracy as we know it in the United States that may be a good thing in light of some of the criticism we have hear today for example in the regulatory context of what democracy produce it will also not look exactly the way either the person in this room or Muslim out in the rest of the world I do not mean to imply there be not Muslim here there probably be conceptualize Islam it will be transformative of Islam as well and as a result of this convergence this synthetic attempt to make sense of this two idea together there be a real possibility that instead of a clash of Islamic civilization if there be such a thing and democratic civilization if there be such a thing we will in fact have close compatibility now I begin with the war because it be the elephant in the room and you can not pretend that there be not about to be a war if you be talk about this issue the war have tremendous risk for the model that I be describe because it be very possible that as a consequence of a war many Muslim will conclude that the United States be not the kind of place that they want to emulate with respect to its form of political government on the other hand there be a further possibility that many American sweep up in the fever of a war will say and feel and think that Islam be the enemy somehow that Islam ought to be construe as the enemy and even though for political tactical reason the president have be very very good about say that Islam be not the enemy nonetheless there be a natural impulse when one enter war to think of the other side as a enemy and one furthermore have the impulse to generalize as much as possible in define who that enemy be so the risk be very great on the other hand the capacity for positive result in the aftermath of a war be also not to be underestimate even by and I would say especially by person who be deeply skeptical about whether we should go to war in the first place that who oppose the war ought to realize that if a war happen it can not be the right strategy either pragmatically or spiritually or morally to say after the war well let let it all run itself out and play out however it want to play out because we oppose the war in the first place that be not the way human circumstance operate you face the circumstance you have in front of you and you go forward well what I be here to say then be for person who be skeptical about the war it be especially important to recognize that in the aftermath of the war there be a possibility for the government of the United States and the Muslim people with whom it interact to create real form of government that be truly democratic and also truly Islamic and it be crucial it be crucial in a practical activist way for person who care about this issue to make sure that within the technology of democracy in this system they exercise they preference they choice and they voice to encourage that outcome that be a hopeful message but it be a message that be hopeful only if you understand it as incur serious obligation for all of we and I think that we be capable of take on that obligation but only if we put what we can into it and if we do then I do not think that the hope will be unwarranted altogether thanks
