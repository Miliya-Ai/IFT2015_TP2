imagine spend seven year at MIT and research laboratory only to find out that you be a performance artist laughter I be also a software engineer and I make lot of different kind of art with the computer and I think the main thing that I be interested in be try to find a way of make the computer into a personal mode of expression and many of you out there be the head of Macromedia and Microsoft and in a way that be my bane I think there be a great homogenizing force that software impose on person and limit the way they think about what be possible on the computer of course it be also a great liberating force that make possible you know publishing and so forth and standard and so on but in a way the computer make possible much more than what most person think and my art have just be about try to find a personal way of use the computer and so I end up write software to do that Chris have ask I to do a short performance and so I be go to take just this time maybe 10 minute to do that and hopefully at the end have just a moment to show you a couple of my other project in video form thank you applause we have get about a minute leave I would just like to show a clip from a most recent project I do a performance with two singer who specialize in make strange noise with they mouth and this just come off last September at ARS Electronica we repeat it in England and the idea be to visualize they speech and song behind they with a large screen we use a computer vision tracking system in order to know where they be and since we know where they head be and we have a wireless mic on they that we be process the sound from we be able to create visualization which be link very tightly to what they be do with they speech this will take about 30 second or so he be make a kind of cheek flap sound well suffice it to say it be not all like that but that be part of it thanks very much there be always lot more I be overtime so I just want to say you can if you be in New York you can check out my work at the Whitney Biennial next week and also at Bitforms Gallery in Chelsea and with that I think I should give up the stage so thank you so much
