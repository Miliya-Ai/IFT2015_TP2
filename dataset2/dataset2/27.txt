you will be happy to know that I will be talk not about my own tragedy but other person tragedy it be a lot easy to be lighthearted about other person tragedy than you own and I want to keep it in the spirit of the conference so if you believe the media account be a drug dealer in the height of the crack cocaine epidemic be a very glamorous life in the word of Virginia Postrel there be money there be drug gun woman you know you name it jewelry bling bling it have it all what I be go to tell you today be that in fact base on 10 year of research a unique opportunity to go inside a gang to see the actual book the financial record of the gang that the answer turn out not to be that be in the gang be a glamorous life but I think more realistically that be in a gang sell drug for a gang be perhaps the bad job in all of America and that be what I would like to convince you of today so there be three thing I want to do first I want to explain how and why crack cocaine have such a profound influence on inner city gang secondly I want to tell you how somebody like I come to be able to see the inner workings of a gang a interesting story I think and then third I want to tell you in a very superficial way about some of the thing we find when we actually get to look at the financial record the book of the gang so before I do that just one warning which be that this presentation have be rate r by the Motion Picture Association of America it contain adult theme adult language give who be up on the stage you will be delighted to know that in fact there will be no nudity laughter unexpected wardrobe malfunction aside laughter so let I start by talk about crack cocaine and how it transform the gang to do that you have to actually go back to a time before crack cocaine in the early 80 and look at it from the perspective of a gang leader be a gang leader in the inner city be not such a bad deal in the mid 80 the early 80 let I say now you have a lot of power and you get to beat person up you get a lot of prestige a lot of respect but the thing be there be no money in it the gang have no way to make money you could not charge due to the person in the gang because the person in the gang do not have any money you could not really make any money sell marijuana marijuana too cheap it turn out you can not get rich selling marijuana you could not sell cocaine cocaine a great product powder cocaine but you have get to know rich white person and most of the inner city gang member do not know any rich white person so could not sell to that market you could not really do petty crime either turn out petty crime a terrible way to make a living as a result as a gang leader you have you know power it be a pretty good life but the thing be in the end you be live at home with you mother and so it be not really a career there be limit to how powerful and important you could be if you have to live at home with you mother then along come crack cocaine and in the word of Malcolm Gladwell crack cocaine be the extra chunky version of tomato sauce for the inner city laughter because crack cocaine be a unbelievable innovation I do not have time to talk about it today but if you think about it I would say that in the last 25 year of every invention or innovation that be occur in this country the big one in term of impact on the well be of person who live in the inner city be crack cocaine and for the bad not for the good but for the bad it have a huge impact on life so what be it about crack cocaine it be a brilliant way of get the brain high because you could smoke crack cocaine you can not smoke powdered cocaine and smoking be a much more efficient mechanism of deliver a high than snort it and it turn out there be this audience that do not know it want crack cocaine but when it come it really do and it be a perfect drug you could buy the cocaine that go into it for a dollar sell it for five dollar highly addictive the high be very short so for fifteen minute you get this great high and then when you come down all you want to do be get high again it create a wonderful market and for the person who be there run the gang it be a great way seemingly to make a lot of money at least for the person on the top so this be where we enter the picture not really I I be really a bit player in all this my co author Sudhir Venkatesh be the main character he be a math major in college who have a good heart and decide he want to get a sociology phd come to the University of Chicago now the three month before he come to Chicago he have spend follow the Grateful Dead and in he own word he look like a freak he be a south Asian very dark skinned south Asian big man and he have hair in he word down to he ass defy all kind of boundary be he black or white be he man or woman he be really a curious sight to be see so he show up at the University of Chicago and the famous sociologist William Julius Wilson be do a book that involve survey person all across Chicago he take one look at Sudhir who be go to go do some survey for he and decide he know exactly the place to send he which be to one of the tough most notorious housing project not just in Chicago but in the entire United States so Sudhir the suburban boy who have never really be in the inner city dutifully take he clipboard and walk down to this housing project get to the first building the first building well there be nobody there but he hear some voice up in the stairwell so he climb up the stairwell come around the corner and find a group of young African American man play dice this be about 1990 peak of the crack epidemic this be a very dangerous job be in a gang you do not like to be surprised you do not like to be surprise by person who come around the corner and the mantra be shoot first ask question later now Sudhir be lucky he be such a freak and that clipboard probably save he life because they figure no other rival gang member would be come up to shoot at they with a clipboard laughter so he greeting be not particularly warm but they do say well ok let hear you question on you survey so I kid you not the first question on the survey that he be send to ask be how do you feel about be poor and black in America laughter make you wonder about academic laughter so the choice of answer be a very good b good c bad d very bad laughter what Sudhir find out be in fact that the real answer be the follow a very good b good c bad d very bad e fuck you laughter the survey be not in the end go to be what get Sudhir off the hook he be hold hostage overnight in the stairwell there be a lot of gunfire there be a lot of philosophical discussion he have with the gang member by morning the gang leader arrive check out Sudhir decide he be no threat and they let he go home so Sudhir go home take a shower take a nap and you and I probably face with the situation would think I guess I be go to write my dissertation on the Grateful Dead I have be follow they for the last three month laughter sudhir on the other hand get right back walk down to the housing project go up to the second floor and say hey guy I have so much fun hang out with you last night I wonder if I could do it again tonight and that be the beginning of what turn out to be a beautiful relationship that involve Sudhir live in the housing project on and off for 10 year hang out in crack house go to jail with the gang member have the window shoot out of he car have the police break into he apartment and steal he computer disk you name it but ultimately the story have a happy end for Sudhir who become one of the most respected sociologist in the country and especially for I as I sit in my office with my Excel spreadsheet open waiting for Sudhir to come and deliver to I the late load of datum that he would get from the gang laughter it be one of the most unequal co author relationship ever laughter but I be glad to be the beneficiary of it so what do we find what do we find in the gang well let I say one thing we really get access to everybody in the gang we get a inside look at the gang from the very bottom up to the very top they trust Sudhir in way that really no academic have ever or really anybody any outsider have ever earn the trust of this gang to the point where they actually open up what be most interesting for I they book the financial record they keep they make they available to we and we not only could study they but we could ask they question about what be in they so if I have to kind of summarize very quickly in the short time I have what the bottom line of what I take away from the gang be it be that if I have to draw a parallel between the gang and any other organization it would be that the gang be just like McDonald in a lot of different respects the restaurant McDonald so first in one way which be not maybe the most interesting way but it be a good way to start be in the way it be organize the hierarchy of the gang the way it look so here be what the org chart of the gang look like I do not know if you know much about org chart but if you be to assign a strip down and simplify McDonald org chart this be exactly what it would look like it be amazing but the top level of the gang they actually call themselves the board of director laughter and Sudhir say it be not like this guy have a very sophisticated view of what happen in American corporate life but they have see movie like Wall Street and they have learn a little bit about what it be like to be in the real world now below that board of director you have get essentially what be regional vp person who control say the South side of Chicago or the West side of Chicago Sudhir get to know very well the guy who have the unfortunate assignment of try to take the Iowa franchise which it turn out for this black gang be not one of the more brilliant financial endeavor they undertake laughter but the thing that really make the gang seem like McDonald be its franchisee the guy who be run the local gang the four square block by four square block area they be just like the guy in some sense who be run the McDonald they be the entrepreneur they get the exclusive property right to control the drug sell they get the name of the gang behind they for merchandising and marketing and they be the one who basically make the profit or lose a profit depend on how good they be at run the business now the group I really want you to think about though be the one at the bottom the foot soldier this be the teenager typically who would be stand out on the street corner sell the drug extremely dangerous work and important to note be that almost all of the weight all of the person in this organization be at the bottom just like McDonald so in some sense the foot soldier be a lot like the person who be take you order at McDonald and it be not just by chance that they be like they in fact in this neighborhood they would be the same person so the same kid who be work in the gang be actually at the very same time typically work part time at a place like McDonald which already foreshadow the main result that I have talk about about what a crappy job it be be in the gang because obviously if be in the gang be such a wonderful lucrative job why in the world would this guy moonlight at McDonald so what do the wages look like you might be surprised but base on be able to talk to they and to see they record this be what it look like in term of the wages the hourly wage the foot soldier be earn be 3 50 a hour it be below the minimum wage and this be well document it be easy to see by the pattern of consumption they have it really be not fiction it be fact there be very little money in the gang especially at the bottom now if you manage to rise up say and be that local leader the guy who be the equivalent of the McDonald franchisee you would be make 100 000 dollar a year and that in some way be the good job you could hope to get if you be grow up in one of this neighborhood as a young black male if you manage to rise to the very top 200 000 or 400 000 dollar a year be what you have hope to make truly you would be a great success story and one of the sad part of this be that indeed among the many other ramification of crack cocaine be that the most talented individual in this community this be what they be strive for they be not try to make it in legitimate way because there be no legitimate channel out this be the good way out and it actually be the right choice probably to try to make it out this way you look at this the relationship to McDonald break down here the money look about the same why be it such a bad job well the reason it be such a bad job be that there be somebody shoot at you a lot of the time so with shooting at you what be the death rate we find in we gang and admittedly this be not really a standard situation this be a time of intense violence of a lot of gang war as this gang actually become quite successful but there be cost and so the death rate not to mention the rate of be arrest send to prison be wound the death rate in we sample be seven percent per person per year you be in the gang for four year you expect to die with about a 25 percent likelihood that be about as high as you can get so for comparison purpose let think about some other walk of life you may expect might be extremely risky let say that you be a murderer and you be convict of murder and you be send to death row it turn out the death rate on death row from all cause include execution two percent a year laughter so it be a lot safe being on death row than it be sell drug out on the street that give you some pause for that of you who believe that a death penalty be go to have a enormous deterrent effect on crime to give you a sense of just how bad the inner city be during crack and I be not really focus on the negative but really there be another story to tell you there if you look at the death rate just of random young black male grow up in the inner city in the United States the death rate during crack be about one percent that be extremely high and this be violent death it be unbelievable in some sense to put it into perspective if you compare this to the soldier in Iraq for instance right now fight the war 0 5 percent so in some very literal way the young black man who be grow up in this country be live in a war zone very much in the sense that the soldier over in Iraq be fight in a war so why in the world you might ask would anybody be willing to stand out on a street corner sell drug for 3 50 a hour with a 25 percent chance of die over the next four year why would they do that and I think there be a couple answer I think the first one be that they get fool by history it use to be the gang be a rite of passage that the young person control the gang that as you get old you drop out of the gang so what happen be the person who happen to be in the right place at the right time the person who happen to be lead the gang in the mid to late 80 become very very wealthy and so the logical thing to think be that they be go to age out of the gang like everybody else have and the next generation be go to take over and get the wealth there be strike similarity I think to the internet boom the first set of person in Silicon Valley get very very rich and then all of my friend say maybe I should go do that too and they be willing to work very cheap for stock option that never come in some sense that be what happen exactly to the set of person we be look at they be willing to start at the bottom just like say a first year lawyer at a law firm be willing to start at the bottom work 80 hour week for not that much money because they think they be go to make partner but the rule change and they never get to make partner indeed the same person who be run all of the major gang in the late 1980 be still run the major gang in Chicago today they never pass on any of the wealth so everybody get stick at that 3 50 a hour job and it turn out to be a disaster the other thing the gang be very good at be market and trickery and so for instance one thing the gang would do be the gang leader would have big entourage and they would drive fancy car and have fancy jewelry so what Sudhir eventually realize as he hang out with they more be that really they do not own that car they just lease they because they could not afford to own the fancy car and they do not really have gold jewelry they have gold plate jewelry it go back to you know the real real versus the fake real and really they do all sort of thing to trick the young person into think what a great deal the gang be go to be so for instance they would give a 14 year old kid a whole roll of bill to hold that 14 year old kid would say to he friend hey look at all the money I get in the gang it be not he money until he spend it and then he be in debt to the gang and be sort of a indentured servant for a while so I have a couple minute let I do one last thing I have not think I would have time to do which be to talk about what we learn more generally about economics from the study of the gang so economist tend to talk in technical word often we theory fail quite miserably when we over the datum but what be kind of interesting be that in this set it turn out that some of the economic theory that work not so well in the real economy work very well in the drug economy in some sense because it be unfettered capitalism here be a economic principle this be one of the basic idea in labor economics call a compensate differential it be the idea that the increment to wages that a worker require to leave he indifferent between perform two task one which be more unpleasant than the other compensate differential it be why we think garbageman might be pay more than person who work in park the word of one of the member of the gang I think make this clear so it turn out I be sort of get ahead of myself it turn out in the gang when there be a war go on they actually pay the foot soldier twice as much money it be exactly this concept because they be not willing to be at risk and the word of a gang member capture it quite nicely he say would you stand around here when all this shit the shooting if all this shit be go on no right so if I gon to be ask to put my life on the line then front I the cash man I think the gang member say it much more articulately than the economist about what be go on laughter here be another one economist talk about game theory that every two person game have a Nash equilibrium here be the translation you get from the gang member they be talk about the decision of why they do not go shoot one thing that turn out to be a great business tactic in the gang if you go and just shoot gun in the air in the other gang territory person be afraid to go buy drug there they be go to come into you neighborhood here be what he say about why they do not do that if we start shoot around there the other gang territory nobody I mean you dig it nobody go to step on they turf but we get ta be careful cause they can shoot around here too and then we all fuck laughter so that be the same concept then again sometimes economist get it wrong one thing we observe in the datum be that it look like the gang leader always get pay no matter how bad it be economically he always get himself pay we have some theory relate to cash flow and lack of access to capital market and thing like that then we ask the gang member why be it you always get pay and you worker do not always get pay he response be you get all this nigger below you who want you job you dig if you start take loss they see you as weak and shit and I think about it and say ceo often pay themselves million dollar bonus even when company be lose a lot of money and it never would really occur to a economist that this idea of weak and shit could really be important laughter maybe weak and shit be a important hypothesis that need more analysis thank you very much applause
