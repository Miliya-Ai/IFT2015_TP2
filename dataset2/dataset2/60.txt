this meeting have really be about a digital revolution but I would like to argue that it be do we win we have have a digital revolution but we do not need to keep have it and I would like to look after that to look what come after the digital revolution so let I start project forward this be some project I be involve in today at MIT look what come after computer this first one internet zero up here this be a web server that have the cost and complexity of a rfid tag about a dollar that can go in every light bulb and doorknob and this be get commercialize very quickly and what be interesting about it be not the cost it be the way it encode the internet it use a kind of a Morse code for the internet so you could send it optically you can communicate acoustically through a power line through RF it take the original principle of the internet which be inter network computer and now let device inter network that we can take the whole idea that give birth to the internet and bring it down to the physical world in this internet zero this internet of device so this be the next step from there to here and this be get commercialize today a step after that be a project on fungible computer fungible goods in economics can be extend and trade so half as much grain be half as much useful but half a baby or half a computer be less useful than a whole baby or a whole computer and we have be try to make computer that work that way so what you see in the background be a prototype this be from a thesis of a student Bill Butow now at Intel who wonder why instead of make big and big chip you do not make small chip put they in a viscous medium and pour out compute by the pound or by the square inch and that be what you see here on the left be postscript be render by a conventional computer on the right be postscript be render from the first prototype we make but there be no frame buffer IO processor any of that stuff it be just this material unlike this screen where the dot be place carefully this be a raw material if you add twice as much of it you have twice as much display if you shoot a gun through the middle nothing happen if you need more resource you just apply more computer so that be the step after this of compute as a raw material that be still conventional bit the step after that be this be a early prototype in the lab this be high speed video slow down now integrate chemistry in computation where the bit be bubble this be show make bit this be show once again slow down so you can see it bit interact to do logic and multiplexing and de multiplex so now we can compute that the output arrange material as well as information and ultimately this be some slide from a early project I do compute where the bit be store quantum mechanically in the nucleus of atom so program rearrange the nuclear structure of molecule all of this be in the lab push further and further and further not as metaphor but literally integrate bit and atom and they lead to the follow recognition we all know we have have a digital revolution but what be that well Shannon take we in the 40 from here to here from a telephone be a speaker wire that degrade with distance to the internet and he prove the first threshold theorem that show if you add information and remove it to a signal you can compute perfectly with a imperfect device and that be when we get the Internet Von Neumann in the 50 do the same thing for compute he show you can have a unreliable computer but restore its state to make it perfect this be the last great analog computer at MIT a differential analyzer and the more you run it the bad the answer get after Von Neumann we have the Pentium where the billionth transistor be as reliable as the first one but all we fabrication be down in this low left corner a state of the art airplane factory rotate metal wax at fix metal or you maybe melt some plastic a 10 billion dollar chip fab use a process a village artisan would recognize you spread stuff around and bake it all the intelligence be external to the system the material do not have information yesterday you hear about molecular biology which fundamentally compute to build it be a information processing system we have have digital revolution in communication and computation but precisely the same idea precisely the same math Shannon and Von Neuman do have not yet come out to the physical world so inspire by that colleague in this program the Center for Bits and Atoms at MIT which be a group of person like I who never understand the boundary between physical science and computer science I would even go far and say computer science be one of the bad thing that ever happen to either computer or to science laughter because the canon computer science many of they be great but the canon of computer science prematurely freeze a model of computation base on technology that be available in 1950 and nature be a much more powerful computer than that so you will hear tomorrow from Saul Griffith he be one of the first student to emerge from this program we start to figure out how you can compute to fabricate this be just a proof of principle he do of tile that interact magnetically where you write a code much like protein folding that specify they structure so there be no feedback to a tool metrology the material itself code for its structure in just the same way that protein be fabricate so you can for example do that you can do other thing that be in 2d it work in 3d the video on the upper right I will not show for time show self replication template so something can make something that can make something and we be do that now over maybe nine order of magnitude that idea have be use to show the good fidelity and direct rate dna to make a organism in functionalize nanocluster with peptide tail that code for they assembly so much like the magnet but now on nanometer scale laser micro machining essentially 3d printer that digitally fabricate functional system all the way up to build building not by have blueprint but have the part code for the structure of the building so this be early example in the lab of emerge technology to digitize fabrication computer that do not control tool but computer that be tool where the output of a program rearrange atom as well as bit now to do that with you tax dollar thank you I buy all this machine we make a modest proposal to the nsf we want to be able to make anything on any length scale all in one place because you can not segregate digital fabrication by a discipline or a length scale so we put together focused nano beam writer and supersonic water jet cutter and excimer micro machining system but I have a problem once I have all this machine I be spend too much time teach student to use they so I start teach a class modestly call how to make almost anything and that be not mean to be provocative it be just for a few research student but the first day of class look like this you know hundred of person come in beg all my life I have be wait for this class I will do anything to do it then they have ask can you teach it at MIT it seem too useful and then the next laughter surprising thing be they be not there to do research they be there because they want to make stuff they have no conventional technical background at the end of a semester they integrate they skill I will show a old video Kelly be a sculptor and this be what she do with she semester project video Kelly hi I be Kelly and this be my scream buddy do you ever find yourself in a situation where you really have to scream but you can not because you be at work or you be in a classroom or you be watch you child or you be in any number of situation where it be just not permit well scream buddy be a portable space for scream when a user scream into scream buddy they scream be silence it be also record for later release where when and how the user choose scream laughter applause so Einstein would like this this student make a web browser for parrot let parrot surf the net and talk to other parrot this student make a alarm clock you wrestle to prove you be awake this be one that defend a dress that defend you personal space this be not technology for communication it be technology to prevent it this be a device that let you see you music this be a student who make a machine that make machine and he make it by make Lego brick that do the computing just year after year and I finally realize the student be show the killer app of personal fabrication be product for a market of one person you do not need this for what you can get in Wal Mart you need this for what make you unique Ken Olsen famously say nobody need a computer in the home but you do not use it for inventory and payroll dec be now twice bankrupt you do not need personal fabrication in the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it you need it for what make you unique just like personalization so with that in turn 20 million dollar today do this 20 year from now we will make Star Trek replicator that make anything the student hijack all the machine I buy to do personal fabrication today when you spend that much of you money there be a government requirement to do outreach which often mean class at a local school a website stuff that be just not that exciting so I make a deal with my nsf program manager that instead of talk about it I would give person the tool this be not mean to be provocative or important but we put together this Fab Labs it be about 20 000 dollar in equipment that approximate both what the 20 million dollar do and where it be go a laser cutter to do press fit assembly with 3d from 2d a sign cutter to plot in copper to do electromagnetic a micron scale numerically control mill machine for precise structure program tool for less than a dollar 100 nanosecond microcontrollers it let you work from micron and microsecond on up and they explode around the world this be not schedule but they go from inner city Boston to Pobal in India to Secondi Takoradi on Ghana coast to Soshanguve in a township in South Africa to the far north of Norway uncover or help uncover for all the attention to the digital divide we would find unused computer in all this place a farmer in a rural village a kid need to measure and modify the world not just get information about it on a screen that there be really a fabrication and a instrumentation divide big than the digital divide and the way you close it be not it for the mass but it development for the mass so in place after place we see this same progression that we have open one of this Fab Labs where we do not this be too crazy to think of we do not think this up that we would get pull to this place we have open it the first step be just empowerment you can see it in they face just this joy of I can do it this be a girl in inner city Boston who have just do a high tech on demand craft sale in the inner city community center it go on from there to serious hand on technical education informally out of school in Ghana we have set up one of this lab we design a network sensor and kid would show up and refuse to leave the lab there be a girl who insist we stay late at night video kid I love the Fab lab she first night in the lab because she be go to make the sensor so she insist on fabb the board learn how to stuff it learn how to program it she do not really know what she be do or why she be do it but she know she just have to do it there be something electric about it this be late at you know 11 o clock at night and I think I be the only person surprised when what she build work the first time and I have show this to engineer at big company and they say they can not do this any one thing she be do they can do good but it be distribute over many person and many site and they can not do in a afternoon what this little girl in rural Ghana be do video girl my name be Valentina Kofi I be eight year old I make a stack board and again that be just for the joy of it then this lab start do serious problem solve instrumentation for agriculture in India steam turbine for energy conversion in Ghana high gain antenna in thin client computer and then in turn business start to grow like make this antenna and finally the lab start do invention we be learn more from they than we be give they I be show my kid in a Fab Lab how to use it they invent a way to do a construction kit out of a cardboard box which as you see up there that be become a business but they design be good than Saul design at MIT so there be now three student at MIT do they thesis on scale the work of eight year old child because they have good design real invention be happen in this lab and I still keep so in the last year I have be spend time with head of state and general and tribal chief who all want this and I keep say but this be not the real thing wait like 20 year and then we will be do and I finally get what be be go on this be Kernigan and Ritchie invent UNIX on a pdp pdp come between mainframe and minicomputer they be ten of thousand of dollar hard to use but they bring compute down to work group and everything we do today happen there this Fab Labs be the cost and complexity of a pdp the projection of digital fabrication be not a projection for the future we be now in the PDP era we talk in hush tone about the great discovery then it be very chaotic it be not sort of clear what be go on in the same sense we be now today in the minicomputer era of digital fabrication the only problem with that be it break everybody boundary in DC I go to every agency that want to talk you know in the Bay Area I go to every organization you can think of they all want to talk about it but it break they organizational boundary in fact it be illegal for they in many case to equip ordinary person to create rather than consume technology and that problem be so severe that the ultimate invention come from this community surprise I it be the social engineering that the lab in far north of Norway this be so far north its satellite dish look at the ground rather than the sky because that be where the satellite be the lab outgrow the little barn that it be in it be there because they want to find animal in the mountain but it outgrow it so they build this extraordinary village for the lab this be not a university it be not a company it be essentially a village for invention it be a village for the outlier in society and that have be grow up around this Fab Labs all around the world so this program have split into a NGO foundation a Fab Foundation to support the scale a micro VC fund the person who run it nicely describe it as machine that make machine need business that make business it be a cross between micro finance and VC to do fan out and then the research partnership back at MIT for what be make it possible so I would like to leave you with two think there be be a sea change in aid from top down mega project to bottom up grassroots micro finance invest in the root so that everybody be get that that be what work but we still look at technology as top down mega project Computing communication energy for the rest of the planet be this top down mega project if this room full of hero be just clever enough you can solve the problem the message come from the Fab Labs be that the other five billion person on the planet be not just technical sink they be source the real opportunity be to harness the inventive power of the world to locally design and produce solution to local problem I think that be the projection 20 year hence into the future but it be where we be today it break every organizational boundary we can think of the hard thing at this point be the social engineering and the organizational engineering but it be here today and finally any talk like this on the future of computing be require to show Moore law but my favorite version this be Gordon Moore original one from he original paper and what be happen be year after year after year we have scale and we have scale and we have scale and we have scale and we have scale and we have scale and we have scale and we have scale and there be this loom bug of what be go to happen at the end of Moore law this ultimate bug be come but we be come to appreciate be the transition from 2d to 3d from programming bit to programming atom turn the end of Moore law scaling from the ultimate bug to the ultimate feature so we be just at the edge of this digital revolution in fabrication where the output of computation program the physical world so together this two project answer question I have not ask carefully the class at MIT show the killer app for personal fabrication in the developed world be technology for a market of one personal expression in technology that touch a passion unlike anything I have see in technology for a very long time and the killer app for the rest of the planet be the instrumentation and the fabrication divide person locally develop solution to local problem thank you
