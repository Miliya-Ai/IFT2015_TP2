what I would like you to do be just really quickly be just sort of nod to the person on you right and then nod to the person on you leave laughter now chance be that over the last winter if you have be a beehive either you or one of the two person you just nod at would have die now that be a awful lot of bee and this be the second year in a row we have lose over 30 percent of the colony or we estimate we have lose 30 percent of the colony over the winter now that be a lot a lot of bee and that be really important and most of that loss be because of thing we know we know that there be this varroa mite that have introduce and cause a lot of loss and we also have this new phenomenon which I talk about last year colony collapse disorder and here we see a picture on top of a hill in Central Valley last December and below you can see all this out yard or temporary yard where the colony be bring in until February and then they be ship out to the almond and one documentary writer who be here and look at this two month after I be here describe this not as beehive but as a graveyard with this empty white box with no bee leave in they now I be go to sum up a year worth of work in two sentence to say that we have be try to figure out what the cause of this be and what we know be that it be as if the bee have catch a flu and this flu have wipe through the population of bee in some case and in fact in most case in one year this flu be cause by a new virus to we or newly identify by we call Israeli Acute Paralysis virus it be call that because a guy in Israel first find it and he now regret profoundly call it that disease because of course there be the implication but we think this virus be pretty ubiquitous it be also pretty clear that the bee sometimes catch other virus or other flus and so the question we be still struggle with and the question that keep we up at night be why have the bee suddenly become so susceptible to this flu and why be they so susceptible to this other disease and we do not have the answer to that yet and we spend a lot of time try to figure that out we think perhaps it be a combination of factor we know from the work of a very large and dynamic working team that you know we be find a lot of different pesticide in the hive and surprisingly sometimes the healthy hive have the most pesticide and so we discover all this very strange thing that we can not begin to understand and so this open up the whole idea of look at colony health now of course if you lose a lot of colony beekeeper can replace they very quickly and that be why we have be able to recover from a lot of loss if we lose one in every three cow in the winter you know the National Guard would be out but what beekeeper can do be if they have one survive colony they can split that colony in two and then the one half that do not have a queen they can buy a queen it come in the mail it can come from Australia or Hawaii or Florida and you can introduce that queen and in fact America be the first country that ever do mail delivery queen and in fact it be part of the postal code that you have to deliver queen by mail in order to make sure that we have enough bee in this country if you do not just want a queen you can buy actually a three pound package of bee which come in the mail and of course the Postal Office be always very concerned when they get you know you three pound package of bee and you can install this in you hive and replace that dead out so it mean that beekeeper be very good at replace dead out and so they have be able to cover that loss so even though we have lose 30 percent of the colony every year the same number of colony have exist in the country at about 2 4 million colony now that loss be tragic on many front and one of that front be for the beekeeper and it be really important to talk about beekeeper first because beekeeper be among the most fascinating person you will ever meet if this be a group of beekeeper you would have everyone from the card carry nra member who be you know live free or die to the you know the self express quirky San Francisco backyard pig farmer laughter and you get all of this person in the same room and they be all engaged and they be get along and they be all there because of the passion for bee now there be another part of that community which be the commercial beekeeper the one who make they livelihood from beekeep alone and this tend to be some of the most independent tenacious intuitive you know inventive person you will ever meet they be just fascinating and they be like that all over the world I have the privilege of work in Haiti just for two week early this year and Haiti if you have ever be there be just a tragedy I mean there may be 100 explanation for why Haiti be the impoverished nation it be but there be no excuse to see that sort of squalor but you meet this beekeeper and I meet this beekeeper here and he be one of the most knowledgeable beekeeper I have ever meet no formal education but very knowledgeable we need beeswax for a project we be work on he be so capable he be able to render the nice block of beeswax I have ever see from cow dung tin can and he veil which he use as a screening right in this meadow and so that ingenuity be inspire we also have Dave Hackenberg who be the poster child of ccd he be the one who first identify this condition and raise the alarm bell and he have a history of this truck and he be move this bee up and down the coast and a lot of person talk about truck and move bee and that be bad but we have do that for thousand of year the ancient Egyptian use to move bee up and down the Nile on raft so this idea of a movable bee force be not new at all and one of we real worry with colony collapse disorder be the fact that it cost so much money to replace that dead out colony and you can do that one year in a row you may be able to do it two year in a row but if you be lose 50 percent to 80 percent of you colony you can not survive three year in a row and we be really worried about lose this segment of we industry and that be important for many front and one of they be because of that culture that be in agriculture and this migratory beekeeper be the last nomad of America you know they pick up they hive they move they family once or twice in a year and if you look at Florida in Dade City Florida that be where all the Pennsylvania beekeeper go and then 20 mile down the road be Groveland and that be where all the Wisconsin beekeeper go and if you be ever in Central Valley in February you go to this caf at 10 o clock in the morning Kathy and Kate and that be where all the beekeeper come after a night of move bee into the almond grove they all have they breakfast and complain about everyone right there and it be a great experience and I really encourage you to drop in at that diner during that time because that be quite essential American experience and we see this family this nomadic family you know father to son father to son and this guy be hurt and they be not person who like to ask for help although they be the most helpful person ever if there be one guy who lose all he bee because of a truck overhaul everyone pitch in and give 20 hive to help he replace that lose colony and so it be a very dynamic and I think historic and exciting community to be involve with of course the real importance for bee be not the honey and although I highly encourage you all use honey I mean it be the most ethical sweetener and you know it be a dynamic and fun sweetener but we estimate that about one in three bite of food we eat be directly or indirectly pollinate by honeybee now I want to just illustrate that in the fact that if we look at the breakfast I have yesterday morning a little cranberry juice some fruit some granola I should have have whole wheat bread I realize but you know jam on my wonderbread and some coffee and have we take out all that ingredient except for the almond I be not go to pick out from the granola if we have take out all that ingredient the bee have indirectly or directly pollinate we would not have much on we plate so if we do not have bee it be not like we would starve but clearly we diet would be diminish it be say that for bee the flower be the fountain of life and for flower bee be the messenger of love and that be a really great expression because really bee be the sex worker for flower they be you know they get pay for they service they get pay by pollen and nectar to move that male sperm the pollen from flower to flower and there be flower that be self infertile that mean they can not the pollen in they bloom can not fertilize themselves so in a apple orchard for instance you will have row of 10 apple of one variety and then you have another apple tree that be a different type of pollen and bee be very faithful when they be out pollinate or gather pollen from one flower they stay to that crop exclusively in order to help generate and of course they be make to carry this pollen they build up a static electric charge and the pollen jump on they and help spread that pollen from bloom to bloom however honeybee be a minority honeybee be not native to America they be introduce with the colonialist and there be actually more species of bee than there be mammal and bird combine in Pennsylvania alone we have be survey bee for 150 year and very intensely in the last three year we have identify over 400 species of bee in Pennsylvania thirty two species have not be identify or find in the state since 1950 now that could be because we have not be sample right but it do I think suggest that something wrong with the pollinator force and this bee be fascinating we have bumblebee on the top and bumblebee be what we call eusocial they be not truly social because only the queen be over winter we also have the sweat bee and this be little gem fly around they be like tiny little fly and they fly around and then you have another type of bee which we call kleptoparasite which be a very fancy way of say bad minded murder what be the word I be look for murder audience Bee Dennis vanEngelsdorp Bee okay thanks laughter what this bee do be they sit there this solitary bee they drill a hole in the ground or drill a hole in a branch and they collect pollen and make it into a ball and they lay a egg on it well this bee hang out at that hole and they wait for that mother to fly away they go in eat the egg and lay they own egg there so they do not do any work and so in fact if you know you have this kleptoparasitic bee you know that you environment be healthy because they be top of the food chain bee and in fact there be now a red list of pollinator that we be worry have disappear and on top of that list be a lot of this kleptoparasite but also this bumblebee and in fact if you guy live on the West Coast go to this website here and they be really look for person to look for some of this bumblebee because we think some have go extinct or some the population have decline and so it be not just honeybee that be in trouble but we do not understand this native pollinator or all that other part of we community and of course bee be not the only important factor here there be other animal that pollinate like bat and bat be in trouble too and I be glad I be a bee man and not a bat man because there be no money to research the bat problem and bat be die at a extraordinary rate white nose syndrome have wipe out population of bat if there be a cave in New York that have 15 000 bat in it and there be 1 000 leave that be like San Francisco become the population of half of this county in three year and so that be incredible and there be no money to do that but I be glad to say that I think we know the cause of all this condition and that cause be NDD Nature Deficit Disorder and that be that I think that what we have in we society be we forget we connection with nature and I think if we reconnect to nature we will be able to have the resource and that interest to solve this problem and I think that there be a easy cure for NDD and that be make meadow and not lawn and I think we have lose we connection and this be a wonderful way of reconnect to we environment I have have the privilege of live by a meadow for the last little while and it be terribly engaging and if we look at the history of lawn it be actually rather tragic it use to be two three hundred year ago that a lawn be a symbol of prestige and so it be only the very rich that could keep this green actually desert they be totally sterile American spend in 2001 11 percent of all pesticide use be do on lawn five percent of we greenhouse gas be produce by mow we lawn and so it be incredible the amount of resource we have spend keep we lawn which be this useless biosystem and so we need to rethink this idea in fact you know the White House use to have sheep in front in order to help fund the war effort in World War I which probably be not a bad idea it would not be a bad idea I want to say this not because I be oppose completely to mow lawn I think that there be perhaps some advantage to keep lawn at a limited scale and I think we be encourage to do that but I also want to reinforce some of the idea we have hear here because have a meadow or living by a meadow be transformational that it be amazing that connection we can have with what be there this milkweed plant have grow up in my meadow over the last four year add to watch the different plant or insect that come to this flower to watch that and we have hear about you know this relationship you can have with wine this companion you can have as it mature and as it have this different fragrance and this be a companion and this be a relationship that never dry up you never run out of that companion as you drink this wine too and I encourage you to look at that now not all of we have meadow or lawn that we can convert and so you can always of course grow a meadow in a pot bee apparently can be the gateway to you know other thing so I be not say that you should plant a meadow of pot but a pot in a meadow but you can also have this great community of city or building top beekeeper this beekeeper that live this be in Paris where this beekeeper live and everyone should open a beehive because it be the most amazing incredible thing and if we want to cure ourselves of NDD or Nature Deficit Disorder I think this be a great way of do it get a beehive and grow a meadow and watch that life come back into you life and so with that I think that what we can do if we do this we can make sure that we future we more perfect future include beekeeper and it include bee and it include that meadow and that journey that journey of transformation that occur as you grow you meadow and as you keep you bee or you watch that native bee there be a extremely exciting one and I hope that you experience it and I hope you tell I about it one day so thank you very much for be here thank you very much
