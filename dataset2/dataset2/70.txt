I be suppose to scare you because it be about fear right and you should be really afraid but not for the reason why you think you should be you should be really afraid that if we stick up the first slide on this thing there we go that you be miss out because if you spend this week think about Iraq and think about Bush and think about the stock market you be go to miss one of the great adventure that we have ever be on and this be what this adventure really about this be crystallize dna every life form on this planet every insect every bacterium every plant every animal every human every politician laughter be code in that stuff and if you want to take a single crystal of dna it look like that and we be just begin to understand this stuff and this be the single most exciting adventure that we have ever be on it be the single great mapping project we have ever be on if you think that the mapping of America make a difference or landing on the moon or this other stuff it be the map of ourselves and the map of every plant and every insect and every bacterium that really make a difference and it be begin to tell we a lot about evolution laughter it turn out that what this stuff be and Richard Dawkins have write about this be this be really a river out of Eden so the 3 2 billion base pair inside each of you cell be really a history of where you have be for the past billion year and we could start date thing and we could start change medicine and archeology it turn out that if you take the human species about 700 year ago white European diverge from black African in a very significant way White European be subject to the plague and when they be subject to the plague most person do not survive but that who survive have a mutation on the ccr5 receptor and that mutation be pass on to they kid because they be the one that survive so there be a great deal of population pressure in Africa because you do not have this city you do not have that ccr5 population pressure mutation we can date it to 700 year ago that be one of the reason why AIDS be rage across Africa as fast as it be and not as fast across Europe and we be begin to find this little thing for malaria for sickle cell for cancer and in the measure that we map ourselves this be the single great adventure that we will ever be on and this Friday I want you to pull out a really good bottle of wine and I want you to toast this two person because this Friday 50 year ago Watson and Crick find the structure of dna and that be almost as important a date as the 12th of February when we first map ourselves but anyway we will get to that I think we have talk about the new zoo so all you guy have hear about dna all the stuff that dna do but some of the stuff we be discover be kind of nifty because this turn out to be the single most abundant species on the planet if you think you be successful or cockroach be successful it turn out that there be ten trillion trillion Pleurococcus sit out there and we do not know that Pleurococcus be out there which be part of the reason why this whole species map project be so important because we be just begin to learn where we come from and what we be and we be find amoeba like this this be the amoeba dubia and the amoeba dubia do not look like much except that each of you have about 3 2 billion letter which be what make you you as far as gene code inside each of you cell and this little amoeba which you know sit in water in hundred and million and billion turn out to have 620 billion base pair of gene code inside so this little thingamajig have a genome that be 200 time the size of yours and if you be think of efficient information storage mechanism it may not turn out to be chip it may turn out to be something that look a little like that amoeba and again we be learn from life and how life work this funky little thing person do not use to think that it be worth take sample out of nuclear reactor because it be dangerous and of course nothing live there and then finally somebody pick up a microscope and look at the water that be sit next to the core and sit next to that water in the core be this little Deinococcus radioduran do a backstroke have its chromosome blow apart every day six seven time restitch they live in about 200 time the radiation that would kill you and by now you should be get a hint as to how diverse and how important and how interesting this journey into life be and how many different life form there be and how there can be different life form live in very different place maybe even outside of this planet because if you can live in radiation that look like this that bring up a whole series of interesting question this little thingamajig we do not know this thingamajig exist we should have know that this exist because this be the only bacterium that you can see to the naked eye so this thing be 0 75 millimeter it live in a deep trench off the coast of Namibia and what you be look at with this namibiensis be the big bacterium we have ever see so it be about the size of a little period on a sentence again we do not know this thing be there three year ago we be just begin this journey of life in the new zoo this be a really odd one this be Ferroplasma the reason why Ferroplasma be interesting be because it eat iron life inside the equivalent of battery acid and excrete sulfuric acid so when you think of odd life form when you think of what it take to live it turn out this be a very efficient life form and they call it a archaea Archaea mean the ancient one and the reason why they be ancient be because this thing come up when this planet be cover by thing like sulfuric acid in battery and it be eat iron when the earth be part of a melt core so it be not just dog and cat and whale and dolphin that you should be aware of and interested in on this little journey you fear should be that you be not that you be pay attention to stuff which be temporal I mean George Bush he be go to be go alright life be not whether the human survive or do not survive this thing be go to be live on this planet or other planet and it be just begin to understand this code of dna that be really the most exciting intellectual adventure that we have ever be on and you can do strange thing with this stuff this be a baby gaur conservation group get together try to figure out how to breed a animal that be almost extinct they can not do it naturally so what they do with this thing be they take a spoon take some cell out of a adult gaur mouth code take the cell from that and insert it into a fertilize cow egg reprogram cow egg different gene code when you do that the cow give birth to a gaur we be now experiment with bongo panda eland Sumatran tiger and the Australian bless they heart be play with this thing now the last of this thing die in September 1936 this be tasmanian tiger the last know one die at the Hobart Zoo but it turn out that as we learn more about gene code and how to reprogram species we may be able to close the gene gap in deteriorate dna and when we learn how to close the gene gap then we can put a full string of dna together and if we do that and insert this into a fertilize wolf egg we may give birth to a animal that have not walk the earth since 1936 and then you can start go back further and you can start think about dodo and you can think about other species and in other place like Maryland they be try to figure out what the primordial ancestor be because each of we contain we entire gene code of where we have be for the past billion year because we have evolve from that stuff you can take that tree of life and collapse it back and in the measure that you learn to reprogram maybe we will give birth to something that be very close to the first primordial ooze and it be all come out of thing that look like this this be company that do not exist five year ago huge gene sequencing facility the size of football field some be public some be private it take about 5 billion dollar to sequence a human be the first time take about 3 million dollar the second time we will have a 1 000 dollar genome within the next five to eight year that mean each of you will contain on a cd you entire gene code and it will be really bear it will read like this laughter the really neat thing about this stuff be that be life and Laurie be go to talk about this one a little bit because if you happen to find this one inside you body you be in big trouble because that be the source code for Ebola that be one of the deadly disease know to human but plant work the same way and insect work the same way and this apple work the same way this apple be the same thing as this floppy disk because this thing code one and zero and this thing code a t c g and it sit up there absorb energy on a tree and one fine day it have enough energy to say execute and it go thump right laughter and when it do that push a exe what it do be it execute the first line of code which read just like that aatcagggaccc and that mean make a root next line of code make a stem next line of code tacgggg make a flower that be white that bloom in the spring that smell like this in the measure that you have the code and the measure that you read it and by the way the first plant be read two year ago the first human be read two year ago the first insect be read two year ago the first thing that we ever read be in 1995 a little bacterium call Haemophilus influenza in the measure that you have the source code as all of you know you can change the source code and you can reprogram life form so that this little thingy become a vaccine or this little thingy start produce biomaterial which be why DuPont be now grow a form of polyester that feel like silk in corn this change all rule this be life but we be reprogram it this be what you look like this be one of you chromosome and what you can do now be you can outlay exactly what you chromosome be and what the gene code on that chromosome be right here and what that gene code for and what animal they code against and then you can tie it to the literature and in the measure that you can do that you can go home today and get on the internet and access the world big public library which be a library of life and you can do some pretty strange thing because in the same way as you can reprogram this apple if you go to Cliff Tabin lab at the Harvard Medical School he be reprogram chicken embryo to grow more wing why would Cliff be do that he do not have a restaurant laughter the reason why he be reprogram that animal to have more wing be because when you use to play with lizard as a little child and you pick up the lizard sometimes the tail fall off but it regrew not so in human being you cut off a arm you cut off a leg it do not regrow but because each of you cell contain you entire gene code each cell can be reprogram if we do not stop stem cell research and if we do not stop genomic research to express different body function and in the measure that we learn how chicken grow wing and what the program be for that cell to differentiate one of the thing we be go to be able to do be to stop undifferentiated cell which you know as cancer and one of the thing we be go to learn how to do be how to reprogram cell like stem cell in such a way that they express bone stomach skin pancreas and you be likely to be wander around and you child on regrown body part in a reasonable period of time in some place in the world where they do not stop the research how be this stuff work if each of you differ from the person next to you by one in a thousand but only three percent code which mean it be only one in a thousand time three percent very small difference in expression and punctuation can make a significant difference take a simple declarative sentence laughter right that be perfectly clear so man read that sentence and they look at that sentence and they read this okay now woman look at that sentence and they say uh uh wrong this be the way it should be see laughter that be what you gene be do that be why you differ from this person over here by one in a thousand right but you know he be reasonably good look but I will not go there you can do this stuff even without change the punctuation you can look at this right and they look at the world a little differently they look at the same world and they say laughter that be how the same gene code that be why you have 30 000 gene mouse have 30 000 gene husband have 30 000 gene mouse and man be the same wife know that but anyway you can make very small change in gene code and get really different outcome even with the same string of letter that be what you gene be do every day that be why sometimes a person gene do not have to change a lot to get cancer this little chippy this thing be the size of a credit card they will test any one of you for 60 000 genetic condition that bring up question of privacy and insurability and all kind of stuff but it also allow we to start go after disease because if you run a person who have leukemia through something like this it turn out that three disease with completely similar clinical syndrome be completely different disease because in all leukemia that set of gene over there over express in MLL it be the middle set of gene and in AML it be the bottom set of gene and if one of that particular thing be express in you body then you take Gleevec and you be cure if it be not express in you body if you do not have one of that type a particular one of that type do not take Gleevec it will not do anything for you same thing with receptin if you have get breast cancer do not have a she 2 receptor do not take receptin change the nature of medicine change the prediction of medicine change the way medicine work the great repository of knowledge when most of we go to college be this thing and it turn out that this be not so important any more the U S Library of Congress in term of its print volume of datum contain less datum than be come out of a good genomic company every month on a compound basis let I say that again a single genomic company generate more datum in a month on a compound basis than be in the print collection of the Library of Congress this be what be be power the U S economy it be Moore Law so all of you know that the price of computer half every 18 month and the power double right except that when you lay that side by side with the speed with which gene data be deposit in GenBank Moore Law be right here it be the blue line this be on a log scale and that be what superexponential growth mean this be go to push computer to have to grow fast than they have be grow because so far there have not be application that have be require that need to go fast than Moore Law this stuff do and here be a interesting map this be a map which be finish at the Harvard Business School one of the really interesting question be if all this datum free who be use it this be the great public library in the world well it turn out that there be about 27 trillion bit move inside from the United States to the United States about 4 6 trillion be go over to that European country about 5 5 be go to Japan there be almost no communication between Japan and nobody else be literate in this stuff it be free no one read it they be focus on the war they be focus on Bush they be not interested in life so this be what a new map of the world look like that be the genomically literate world and that be a problem in fact it be not a genomically literate world you can break this out by state and you can watch state rise and fall depend on they ability to speak a language of life and you can watch New York fall off a cliff and you can watch New Jersey fall off a cliff and you can watch the rise of the new empire of intelligence and you can break it out by county because it be specific county and if you want to get more specific it be actually specific zip code laughter so you want to know where life be happen well in Southern California it be happen in 92121 and that be it and that be the triangle between Salk Scripps UCSD and it be call Torrey pine road that mean you do not need to be a big nation to be successful it mean you do not need a lot of person to be successful and it mean you can move most of the wealth of a country in about three or four carefully pick 747 same thing in Massachusetts look more spread out but oh by the way the one that be the same color be contiguous what be the net effect of this in a agricultural society the difference between the rich and the poor the most productive and the least productive be five to one why because in agriculture if you have 10 kid and you grow up a little bit early and you work a little bit hard you could produce about five time more wealth on average than you neighbor in a knowledge society that number be now 427 to 1 it really matter if you be literate not just in reading and writing in English and French and German but in Microsoft and Linux and Apple and very soon it be go to matter if you be literate in life code so if there be something you should fear it be that you be not keep you eye on the ball because it really matter who speak life that be why nation rise and fall and it turn out that if you go back to the 1870s the most productive nation on earth be Australia per person and New Zealand be way up there and then the U S come in about 1950 and then Switzerland about 1973 and then the U S get back on top beat up they chocolate and cuckoo clock and today of course you all know that the most productive nation on earth be Luxembourg produce about one third more wealth per person per year than America tiny landlocked state no oil no diamond no natural resource just smart person move bit different rule here be differential productivity rate here be how many person it take to produce a single u s patent so about 3 000 American 6 000 Korean 14 000 Brits 790 000 Argentines you want to know why Argentina crash it be get nothing to do with inflation it be get nothing to do with privatization you can take a Harvard educate Ivy League economist stick he in charge of Argentina he still crash the country because he do not understand how the rule have change oh yeah and it take about 5 6 million Indian well watch what happen to India India and China use to be 40 percent of the global economy just at the Industrial Revolution and they be now about 4 8 percent two billion person one third of the global population produce 5 percent of the wealth because they do not get this change because they keep treat they person like serf instead of like shareholder of a common project they do not keep the person who be educate they do not foment the business they do not do the ipo Silicon Valley do and that be why they say that Silicon Valley have be power by ic not integrate circuit Indian and Chinese laughter here be what be happen in the world it turn out that if you would go to the u n in 1950 when it be find there be 50 country in this world it turn out there be now about 192 country after country be split secede succeed fail and it be all get very fragmented and this have not stop in the 1990 this be sovereign state that do not exist before 1990 and this do not include fusion or name change or change in flag we be generate about 3 12 state per year person be take control of they own state sometimes for the good and sometimes for the bad and the really interesting thing be you and you kid be empower to build great empire and you do not need a lot to do it music and give that the music be over I be go to talk about how you can use this to generate a lot of wealth and how code work moderator two minute laughter Juan Enriquez No I be go to stop there and we will do it next year because I do not want to take any of Laurie time but thank you very much
