it be a great honor to be here with you the good news be I be very aware of my responsibility to get you out of here because I be the only thing stand between you and the bar laughter and the good news be I do not have a prepared speech but I have a box of slide I have some picture that represent my life and what I do for a living I have learn through experience that person remember picture long after they have forget word and so I hope you will remember some of the picture I be go to share with you for just a few minute the whole story really start with I as a high school kid in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania in a tough neighborhood that everybody give up on for dead and on a Wednesday afternoon I be walk down the corridor of my high school kind of mind my own business and there be this artist teaching who make a great big old ceramic vessel and I happen to be look in the door of the art room and if you have ever see clay do it be magic and I would never see anything like that before in my life so I walk in the art room and I say what be that and he say Ceramics and who be you and I say I be Bill Strickland I want you to teach I that and he say well get you homeroom teacher to sign a piece of paper that say you can come here and I will teach it to you and so for the remain two year of my high school I cut all my class laughter but I have the presence of mind to give the teacher class that I cut the pottery that I make laughter and they give I pass grade and that be how I get out of high school and Mr Ross say you be too smart to die and I do not want it on my conscience so I be leave this school and I be take you with I and he drive I out to the University of Pittsburgh where I fill out a college application and get in on probation well I be now a trustee of the university and at my installation ceremony I say I be the guy who come from the neighborhood who get into the place on probation do not give up on the poor kid because you never know what be go to happen to that child in life what I be go to show you for a couple of minute be a facility that I build in the tough neighborhood in Pittsburgh with the high crime rate one be call Bidwell Training Center it be a vocational school for ex steel worker and single parent and welfare mother you remember we use to make steel in Pittsburgh well we do not make any steel anymore and the person who use to make the steel be have a very tough time of it and I rebuild they and give they new life manchester craftsman guild be name after my neighborhood I be adopt by the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese during the riot and he donate a row house and in that row house I start Manchester Craftsmen Guild and I learn very quickly that wherever there be Episcopalians there be money in very close proximity laughter and the Bishop adopt I as he kid and last year I speak at he memorial service and wish he well in this life I go out and hire a student of Frank Lloyd Wright the architect and I ask he to build I a world class center in the bad neighborhood in Pittsburgh and my building be a scale model for the Pittsburgh airport and when you come to Pittsburgh and you be all invite you will be fly into the blow up version of my building that be the building build in a tough neighborhood where person have be give up for dead my view be that if you want to involve yourself in the life of person who have be give up on you have to look like the solution and not the problem as you can see it have a fountain in the courtyard and the reason it have a fountain in the courtyard be I want one and I have the checkbook so I buy one and put it there laughter and now that I be give speech at conference like TED I get put on the board of the Carnegie Museum at a reception in they courtyard I notice that they have a fountain because they think that the person who go to the museum deserve a fountain well I think that welfare mother and at risk kid and ex steel worker deserve a fountain in they life and so the first thing that you see in my center in the springtime be water that greet you water be life and water of human possibility and it set a attitude and expectation about how you feel about person before you ever give they a speech so from that fountain I build this building as you can see it have world class art and it be all my taste because I raise all the money laughter I say to my boy when you raise the money we will put you taste on the wall that we have quilt and clay and calligraphy and everywhere you eye turn there be something beautiful look back at you that be deliberate that be intentional in my view it be this kind of world that can redeem the soul of poor person we also create a boardroom and I hire a Japanese cabinetmaker from Kyoto Japan and commission he to do 60 piece of furniture for we build we have since spin he off into he own business he be make a ton of money do custom furniture for rich person and I get 60 piece out of it for my school because I feel that welfare mom and ex steel worker and single parent deserve to come to a school where there be handcraft furniture that greet they every day because it set a tone and a attitude about how you feel about person long before you give they the speech we even have flower in the hallway and they be not plastic that be real and they be in my building every day and now that I have give lot of speech we have a bunch of high school principal come and see I and they say Mr Strickland what a extraordinary story and what a great school and we be particularly touch by the flower and we be curious as to how the flower get there I say well I get in my car and I go out to the greenhouse and I buy they and I bring they back and I put they there you do not need a task force or a study group to buy flower for you kid what you need to know be that the child and the adult deserve flower in they life the cost be incidental but the gesture be huge and so in my building which be full of sunlight and full of flower we believe in hope and human possibility that happen to be at Christmas time and so the next thing you will see be a million dollar kitchen that be build by the Heinz company you have hear of they they do all right in the ketchup business and I happen to know that company pretty well because John Heinz who be we u be senator who be tragically kill in a plane accident he have hear about my desire to build a new building because I have a cardboard box and I put it in a garbage bag and I walk all over Pittsburgh try to raise money for this site and he call I into he office which be the equivalent of go to see the Wizard of Oz laughter and John Heinz have 600 million dollar and at the time I have about 60 cent and he say but we have hear about you we have hear about you work with the kid and the ex steel worker and we be incline to want to support you desire to build a new building and you could do we a great service if you would add a culinary program to you program because back then we be build a trade program he say that way we could fulfill we affirmative action goal for the Heinz company I say Senator I be reluctant to go into a field that I do not know much about but I promise you that if you will support my school I will get it build and in a couple of year I will come back and weigh out that program that you desire and Senator Heinz sit very quietly and he say well what would you reaction be if I say I would give you a million dollar I say Senator it appear that we be go into the food training business laughter and John Heinz do give I a million buck and most importantly he loan I the head of research for the Heinz company and we kind of borrow the curriculum from the Culinary Institute of America which in they mind be kind of the Harvard of cook school and we create a gourmet cook program for welfare mother in this million dollar kitchen in the middle of the inner city and we have never look back I would like to show you now some of the food that this welfare mother do in this million dollar kitchen that happen to be we cafeteria line that be puff pastry day why because the student make puff pastry and that be what the school eat every day but the concept be that I want to take the stigma out of food that good food be not for rich person good food for everybody on the planet and there be no excuse why we all can not be eat it so at my school we subsidize a gourmet lunch program for welfare mother in the middle of the inner city because we have discover that it be good for they stomach but it be good for they head because I want to let they know every day of they life that they have value at this place I call my center we have student who sit together black kid and white kid and what we have discover be you can solve the race problem by create a world class environment because person will have a tendency to show you world class behavior if you treat they in that way this be example of the food that welfare mother be do after six month in the training program no sophistication no class no dignity no history what we have discover be the only thing wrong with poor person be they do not have any money which happen to be a curable condition it be all in the way that you think about person that often determine they behavior that be do by a student after seven month in the program do by a very brilliant young woman who be teach by we pastry chef I have actually eat seven of that basket and they be very good laughter they have no calorie that be we dining room it look like you average high school cafeteria in you average town in America but this be my view of how student ought to be treat particularly once they have be push aside we train pharmaceutical technician for the pharmacy industry we train medical technician for the medical industry and we train chemical technician for company like Bayer and Calgon Carbon and Fisher Scientific and Exxon and I will guarantee you that if you come to my center in Pittsburgh and you be all invite you will see welfare mother do analytical chemistry with logarithmic calculator 10 month from enrol in the program there be absolutely no reason why poor person can not learn world class technology what we have discover be you have to give they flower and sunlight and food and expectation and Herbie music and you can cure a spiritual cancer every time we train corporate travel agent for the travel industry we even teach person how to read the kid with the red stripe be in the program two year ago he be now a instructor and I have child with high school diploma that they can not read and so you must ask yourself the question how be it possible in the 21st century that we graduate child from school who can not read the diploma that they have in they hand the reason be that the system get reimburse for the kid they spit out the other end not the child who read I can take this child and in 20 week demonstrate aptitude I can get they high school equivalent no big deal that be we library with more handcrafted furniture and this be the art program I start in 1968 remember I be the black kid from the 60 who get he life save with ceramic well I go out and decide to reproduce my experience with other kid in the neighborhood the theory be if you get kid flower and you give they food and you give they sunshine and enthusiasm you can bring they right back to life I have 400 kid from the Pittsburgh public school system that come to I every day of the week for art education and this be child who be flunk out of public school and last year I put 88 percent of that kid in college and I have average over 80 percent for 15 year we have make a fascinating discovery there be nothing wrong with the kid that affection and sunshine and food and enthusiasm and Herbie music can not cure for that I win a big old plaque man of the year in Education I beat out all the ph d because I figure that if you treat child like human be it increase the likelihood they be go to behave that way and why we can not institute that policy in every school and in every city and every town remain a mystery to I let I show you what this person do we have ceramic and photography and computer imaging and this be all kid with no artistic ability no talent no imagination and we bring in the world great artist Gordon Parks have be there Chester Higgins have be there and what we have learn be that the child will become like the person who teach they in fact I bring in a Mosaic artist from the Vatican a African American woman who have study the old Vatican Mosaic technique and let I show you what they do with the work this be child who the whole world have give up on who be flunk out of public school and that be what they be capable of do with affection and sunlight and food and good music and confidence we teach photography and this be example of some of the kid work that boy win a four year scholarship on the strength of that photograph this be we gallery we have a world class gallery because we believe that poor kid need a world class gallery so I design this thing we have smoke salmon at the art opening we have a formal print invitation and I even have figure out a way to get they parent to come I could not buy a parent 15 year ago so I hire a guy who get off on the Jesus big time he be drag guy out of bar and save that life for the Lord and I say Bill I want to hire you man you have to tone down the Jesus stuff a little bit but keep the enthusiasm laughter applause I can not get this parent to come to the school he say I will get they to come to the school so he jump in the van he go to Miss Jones house and say Miss Jones I know you want to come to you kid art opening but you probably do not have a ride so I come to give you a ride and he get 10 parent and then 20 parent at the last show that we do 200 parent show up and we do not pick up one parent because now it be become socially not acceptable not to show up to support you child at the Manchester Craftsmen Guild because person think you be bad parent and there be no statistical difference between the white parent and the black parent mother will go where they child be be celebrate every time every town every city I want you to see this gallery because it be as good as it get and by the time I cut this kid loose from high school they have get four show on they resume before they apply to college because it be all up here you have to change the way that person see themselves before you can change they behavior and it be work out pretty good up to this day I even stick another room on the building which I have like to show you this be brand new we just get this slide do in time for the TED Conference I give this little slide show at a place call the Silicon Valley and I do all right and the woman come out of the audience she say that be a great story and I be very impressed with you presentation my only criticism be you computer be get a little bit old and I say well what do you do for a live she say well I work for a company call Hewlett Packard and I say you be in the computer business be that right she say yes sir and I say well there be a easy solution to that problem well I be very pleased to announce to you that HP and a furniture company call Steelcase have adopt we as a demonstration model for all of they technology and all they furniture for the United States of America and that be the room that be initiate the relationship we get it just do in time to show you so it be kind of the world debut of we digital imaging center applause music I only have a couple more slide and this be where the story get kind of interesting so I just want you to listen up for a couple more minute and you will understand why he be there and I be here in 1986 I have the presence of mind to stick a music hall on the north end of the building while I be build it and a guy name Dizzy Gillespie show up to play there because he know this man over here Marty Ashby and I stand on that stage with Dizzy Gillespie on sound check on a Wednesday afternoon and I say dizzy why would you come to a black run center in the middle of a industrial park with a high crime rate that do not even have a reputation in music he say because I hear you build the center and I do not believe that you do it and I want to see for myself and now that I have I want to give you a gift I say you be the gift he say no sir you be the gift and I be go to allow you to record the concert and I be go to give you the music and if you ever choose to sell it you must sign a agreement that say the money will come back and support the school and I record Dizzy and he die a year later but not before tell a fellow name McCoy Tyner what we be do and he show up and say Dizzy talk about you all over the country man and I want to help you and then a guy name Wynton Marsalis show up then a bass player name Ray Brown and a fellow name Stanley Turrentine and a piano player name Herbie Hancock and a band call the Count Basie Orchestra and a fellow name Tito Puente and a guy name Gary Burton and Shirley Horn and Betty Carter and Dakota Staton and Nancy Wilson all have come to this center in the middle of a industrial park to sell out audience in the middle of the inner city and I be very pleased to tell you that with they permission I have now accumulate 600 recording of the great artist in the world include Joe Williams who die but not before he last recording be do at my school and Joe Williams come up to I and he put he hand on my shoulder and he say God pick you man to do this work and I want my music to be with you and that work out all right when the Basie band come the band get so excited about the school they vote to give I the right to the music and I record it and we win something call a Grammy and like a fool I do not go to the ceremony because I do not think we be go to win well we do win and we name be literally in light over Madison Square Garden then the U N Jazz Orchestra drop by and we record they and get nominate for a second Grammy back to back so we have become one of the hot young jazz recording studio in the United States of America laughter in the middle of the inner city with a high crime rate that be the place all fill up with Republican laughter applause if you would have drop a bomb on that room you would have wipe out all the money in Pennsylvania because it be all sit there include my mother and father who live long enough to see they kid build that building and there be dizzy just like I tell you he be there and he be there Tito Puente and Pat Metheny and Jim Hall be there and they record with we and that be we first record studio which be the broom closet we put the mop in the hallway and re engineer the thing and that be where we record the first Grammy and this be we new facility which be all video technology and that be a room that be build for a woman name Nancy Wilson who record that album at we school last Christmas and any of you who happen to have be watch Oprah Winfrey on Christmas Day he be there and Nancy be there sing excerpt from this album the right to which she donate to we school and I can now tell you with absolute certainty that a appearance on Oprah Winfrey will sell 10 000 cd laughter we be currently number four on the Billboard Charts right behind Tony Bennett and I think we be go to be fine this be burn out during the riot this be next to my building and so I have another cardboard box build and I walk back out in the street again and that be the building and that be the model and on the right a high tech greenhouse and in the middle the medical technology building and I be very pleased to tell you that the building do it be also full of anchor tenant at 20 dollar a foot triple that in the middle of the inner city and there be the fountain laughter every building have a fountain and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center be anchor tenant and they take half the building and we now train medical technician through all they system and Mellon Bank a tenant and I love they because they pay the rent on time laughter and as a result of the association I be now a director of the Mellon Financial Corporation that buy Dreyfus and this be in the process of be build as we speak Multiply that picture time four and you will see the greenhouse that be go to open in October this year because we be go to grow that flower in the middle of the inner city and we be go to have high school kid grow Phalaenopsis orchid in the middle of the inner city and we have a handshake with one of the large retail grocer to sell we orchid in all 240 store in six state and we partner be Zuma Canyon Orchids of Malibu California who be Hispanic so the Hispanic and the black folk have form a partnership to grow high technology orchid in the middle of the inner city and I tell my United States senator that there be a very high probability that if he could find some funding for this we would become a left hand column in the Wall Street Journal to which he readily agree and we get the funding and we open in the fall and you ought to come and see it it be go to be a hell of a story and this be what I want to do when I grow up laughter the brown building be the one you guy have be look at and I will tell you where I make my big mistake I have a chance to buy this whole industrial park which be less than 1 000 foot from the riverfront for four million dollar and I do not do it and I build the first building and guess what happen I appreciate the real estate value beyond everybody expectation and the owner of the park turn I down for eight million dollar last year and say Mr Strickland you ought to get the Civic Leader of the year award because you have appreciate we property value beyond we wildest expectation thank you very much for that the moral of the story be you must be prepare to act on you dream just in case they do come true and finally there be this picture this be in a place call San Francisco and the reason this picture in here be I do this slide show a couple year ago at a big economics summit and there be a fellow in the audience who come up to I he say Man that be a great story I want one of that I say well I be very flattered what do you do for a live he say I run the city of San Francisco my name Willie Brown and so I kind of accept the flattery and the praise and put it out of my mind and that weekend I be go back home and Herbie Hancock be play we center that night first time I have meet he and he walk in and he say what be this and I say Herbie this be my concept of a training center for poor person and he say as God as my witness I have have a center like this in my mind for 25 year and you have build it and now I really want to build one I say well where would you build this thing he say San Francisco I say any chance you know Willie Brown laughter as a matter of fact he do know Willie Brown and Willie Brown and Herbie and I have dinner four year ago and we start draw out that center on the tablecloth and Willie Brown say as sure as I be the mayor of San Francisco I be go to build this thing as a legacy to the poor person of this city and he get I five acre of land on San Francisco Bay and we get a architect and we get a general contractor and we get Herbie on the board and we friend from HP and we friend from Steelcase and we friend from Cisco and we friend from Wells Fargo and Genentech and along the way I meet this real short guy at my slide show in the Silicon Valley he come up to I afterwards he say Man that be a fabulous story I want to help you and I say well thank you very much for that what do you do for a live he say well I build a company call eBay I say well that be very nice thanks very much and give I you card and sometime we will talk I do not know eBay from that jar of water sit on that piano but I have the presence of mind to go back and talk to one of the techie kid at my center I say hey man what be eBay he say well that be the electronic commerce network I say well I meet the guy who build the thing and he leave I he card so I call he up on the phone and I say Mr Skoll I have come to have a much deep appreciation of who you be laughter and I would like to become you friend laughter and Jeff and I do become friend and he be organize a team of person and we be go to build this center and I go down into the neighborhood call Bayview Hunters Point and I say the mayor send I down here to work with you and I want to build a center with you but I be not go to build you anything if you do not want it and all I have get be a box of slide and so I stand up in front of 200 very angry very disappointed person on a summer night and the air conditioner have break and it be 100 degree outside and I start show this picture and after about 10 picture they all settle down and I run the story and I say what do you think and in the back of the room a woman stand up and she say in 35 year of live in this God forsake place you be the only person that be come down here and treat we with dignity I be go with you man and she turn that audience around on a pin and I promise this person that I be go to build this thing and we be go to build it all right and I think we can get in the ground this year as the first replication of the center in Pittsburgh but I meet a guy name Quincy Jones along the way and I show he the box of slide and Quincy say I want to help you man let do one in l a and so he be assemble a group of person and I have fall in love with he as I have with Herbie and with he music and Quincy say where do the idea for center like this come from and I say it come from you music man because Mr Ross use to bring in you album when I be 16 year old in the pottery class when the world be all dark and you music get I to the sunlight and I say if I can follow that music I will get out into the sunlight and I will be ok and if that be not true how do I get here I want you all to know that I think the world be a place that be worth live I believe in you I believe in you hope and you dream I believe in you intelligence and I believe in you enthusiasm and I be tired of live like this go into town after town with person stand around on corner with hole where eye use to be they spirit damage we will not make it as a country unless we can turn this thing around in Pennsylvania it cost 60 000 dollar to keep person in jail most of whom look like I it be 40 000 dollar to build the University of Pittsburgh Medical School it be 20 000 dollar cheap to build a medical school than to keep person in jail do the math it will never work I be bank on you and I be bank on guy like Herbie and Quincy and Hackett and Richard and very decent person who still believe in something and I want to do this in my lifetime in every city and in every town and I do not think I be crazy I think we can get home on this thing and I think we can build this all over the country for less money than we be spend on prison and I believe we can turn this whole story around to one of celebration and one of hope in my business it be very difficult work you be always fight upstream like a salmon never enough money too much need and so there be a tendency to have a occupational depression that accompany my work and so I have figure out over time the solution to the depression you make a friend in every town and you will never be lonely and my hope be that I have make a few here tonight and thanks for listen to what I have to say applause
