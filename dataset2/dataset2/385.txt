let talk trash you know we have to be teach to renounce the powerful conservation ethic we develop during the Great Depression and World War II after the war we need to direct we enormous production capacity toward creation of product for peacetime Life Magazine help in this effort by announce the introduction of throwaway that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of do dish Mental note to the liberator throwaway plastic take a lot of space and do not biodegrade only we human make waste that nature can not digest plastic be also hard to recycle a teacher tell I how to express the under five percent of plastic recover in we waste stream it be diddly point squat that be the percentage we recycle now melt point have a lot to do with this Plastic be not purify by the re melting process like glass and metal it begin to melt below the boiling point of water and do not drive off the oily contaminant for which it be a sponge half of each year 100 billion pound of thermal plastic pellet will be make into fast track trash a large unruly fraction of we trash will flow downriver to the sea here be the accumulation at Biona Creek next to the l a airport and here be the flotsam near California State University Long Beach and the diesel plant we visit yesterday in spite of deposit fee much of this trash lead out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottle we use two million of they in the United States every five minute here image by TED presenter Chris Jordan who artfully document mass consumption and zoom in for more detail here be a remote island repository for bottle off the coast of Baja California Isla San Roque be a uninhabited bird rookery off Baja sparsely populated central coast notice that the bottle here have cap on they bottle make of polyethylene terephthalate pet will sink in seawater and not make it this far from civilization also the cap be produce in separate factory from a different plastic polypropylene they will float in seawater but unfortunately do not get recycle under the bottle bill let trace the journey of the million of cap that make it to sea solo after a year the one from Japan be head straight across the Pacific while ours get catch in the California current and first head down to the latitude of Cabo San Lucas after ten year a lot of the Japanese cap be in what we call the Eastern Garbage Patch while ours litter the Philippines after 20 year we see emerge the debris accumulation zone of the North Pacific Gyre it so happen that million of albatross nest on Kure and Midway atoll in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands National Monument forage here and scavenge whatever they can find for regurgitation to they chick a four month old Laysan Albatross chick die with this in its stomach hundred of thousand of the goose sized chick be die with stomach full of bottle cap and other rubbish like cigarette light but mostly bottle cap sadly they parent mistake bottle cap for food toss about in the ocean surface the retainer ring for the cap also have consequence for aquatic animal this be Mae West still alive at a zookeeper home in New Orleans I want to see what my home town of Long Beach be contribute to the problem so on Coastal Clean up Day in 2005 I go to the Long Beach Peninsula at the east end of we long beach we clean up the swath of beach show I offer five cent each for bottle cap I get plenty of taker here be the 1 100 bottle cap they collect I think I would spend 20 buck that day I end up spend nearly 60 I separate they by color and put they on display the next Earth Day at Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro Governor Schwarzenegger and he wife Maria stop by to discuss the display in spite of my girly man hat crochet from plastic shopping bag they shake my hand laughter I show he and Maria a zooplankton trawl from the gyre north of Hawaii with more plastic than plankton here be what we trawl sample from the plastic soup we ocean have become look like trawl a zooplankton net on the surface for a mile produce sample like this and this now when the debris wash up on the beach of Hawaii it look like this and this particular beach be Kailua Beach the beach where we president and he family vacation before move to Washington now how do we analyze sample like this one that contain more plastic than plankton we sort the plastic fragment into different size class from five millimeter to one third of a millimeter small bit of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutant up to a million time they level in the surround seawater we want to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean at the base of the food chain be ingest this poison pill we do hundred of necropsy and over a third have pollute plastic fragment in they stomach the record holder only two and a half inch long have 84 piece in its tiny stomach now you can buy certified organic produce but no fishmonger on Earth can sell you a certified organic wild catch fish this be the legacy we be leave to future generation the throwaway society can not be contain it have go global we simply can not store and maintain or recycle all we stuff we have to throw it away now the market can do a lot for we but it can not fix the natural system in the ocean we have break all the king horse and all the king man will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again Narrator Video the level be increase the amount of packaging be increase the throwaway concept of live be proliferate and it be show up in the ocean Anchor he offer no hope of clean it up strain the ocean for plastic would be beyond the budget of any country and it might kill untold amount of sea life in the process the solution Moore say be to stop the plastic at its source stop it on land before it fall in the ocean and in a plastic wrap and package world he do not hold out much hope for that either this be Brian Rooney for Nightline in Long Beach California Charles Moore thank you
