I have always want to be a cyborg one of my favorite show as a kid be the six million dollar man and this be a little bit close to the 240 dollar man or so but laughter at any rate I would normally feel very self conscious and geeky wear this around but a few day ago I see one world renowned statistician swallow sword on stage here so I figure it be ok amongst this group but that be not what I want to talk about today I want to talk about toy and the power that I see inherent in they when I be a kid I attend Montessori school up to sixth grade in Atlanta Georgia and at the time I do not think much about it but then later I realize that that be the high point of my education from that point on everything else be pretty much downhill and it be not until later as I start make game that I really actually think of they more as toy person call I a game designer but I really think of this thing more as toy I start get very interested in Maria Montessori and she method and the way she go about thing and the way she think it very valuable for kid to discover thing on they own rather than be teach this thing overtly and she would design this toy where kid in play with the toy would come to understand this deep principle of life and nature through play and since they discover this it stick with they so much more and also they would experience they own failure there be a failure base aspect to learn there it be very important and so the game that I do I think of really more as modern Montessori toy and I really kind of want they to be present in a way to where kid can kind of explore and discover they own principle so a few year ago I start get very interested in the seti program and that be the way I work I get interested in different subject I dive in research they and then try to figure out how to craft a toy around that so that other person can experience the same sense of discovery that I do as I be learn that subject and it lead I to astrobiology the study of possible life in the universe and then Drake equation look at the probability of life arise on planet how long it might last how many planet be out there and I start look at how interesting Drake equation be because it span all this different subject physics chemistry sociology economics astronomy and another thing that really impress I a long time ago be Powers of ten Charles and Ray Eames film and I start put that two together and wonder could I build a toy where kid would trip across all this interesting principle of life as it exist and as it might go in the future thing where you might trip across thing like the Copernican principle the Fermi paradox the anthropic principle the origin of life and so I be go to show you a toy today that I have be work on that I think of more as kind of a philosophy toy play this toy will bring up philosophical question in you the game be spore I have be work on it for several year it be get pretty close to finish now it occur at all this different scale from very small to very large I be go to pop in at the start of the game and you actually start this game in a drop of water as a very very small single cell creature and right off the bat you basically just have to live survive reproduce so here we be at a very microscopic scale swimming around and I actually realize that cell do not have eye but it help to make it cute the player be go to play through every generation of this species and as you play the game the creature be actually grow bit by bit and as we start grow the camera will actually start zoom out and thing that you see in the background there will start slowly pull into the foreground show you a little bit of what you will be interact with as you grow so as we eat the camera start pull out and then we start interact with large and large organism we actually play through many generation here at the cellular scale I be go to skip ahead here at some point we get large and we actually get to a macroevolution scale now at this point we be leave the water and one thing that be kind of important about this game be that at every level the player be design they creature and that be a fundamental aspect of this now in the evolution game here the creature scale basically you have to eat survive and then reproduce you know very darwinian one thing we notice with the Sims a game I do early be that player love make stuff when they be able to make stuff in the game they have a lot of empathy in connection to it even if it be not as pretty as a professional artist would make for game it really stick with they and they really care about what would happen to it at this point we have leave the water and now with this little creature we could bring up the volume a little bit and now we might try to eat we might sneak up on this little guy over here maybe and try and eat he ok well we fight creature grunt ok we get he now we get a meal so really at this part of the game what we be do be we be run around and survive and also get to the next generation because we be go to play through every generation of this creature we can mate so I be go to see if one of this creature want to mate with I yeah creature grunt we do not want to replay actual evolution with human and all that because it be almost more interesting to look at alternate possibility in evolution evolution be usually present as this one path that we take through but really it represent this huge set of possibility now once we mate we click on the egg and this be where the game start get interesting because one of the thing we really focus on here be give the player very high leverage tool so that for very little effort the player can make something very cool and it involve a lot of intelligence on the tool side but basically this be the editor where we be go to design the next generation so it have a little spine I can move around I can extend I can also inflate or deflate it with the mouse wheel so you sculpt it like clay we have part here that I can put on or pull off the idea be that the player can basically design anything they can think of in this editor and we will basically bring it to life so I might put some limb on the character here I will inflate they kind of large and in this case I might decide I be go to put I will put mouth on the limb so pretty much player be encourage to be very creative in the game here I will give it one eye in the middle maybe scale it up a bit point it down and I will also give it a few leg so in some sense we want this to feel like a amplifier for the player imagination so that with a very small number of click a player can create something that they do not really think be possible before this be almost like design something like Maya that a eight year old can use but really the goal here be within about a minute I want somebody to replicate what typically take a pictorial artist several week to create ok now I will put some hand on it ok so here I have basically throw together a little creature let I give it a little weapon on the tail here so it can fight ok so that be the complete model now we can actually go to the painting phase at this phase the program have some understanding of the topology of this creature it know where the backbone be where the spine the limb be how stripe should run how it should be shade and so we be procedurally generate the texture map something a texture artist would take many day to work on and then we can test it out and see how it would move around and so at this point the computer be procedurally animate this creature it be look at whatever I have design it will actually bring it to life and I can see how it might dance laughter how it might show emotion how it might fight so it be act with its two mouth there I can even have it pose for a photo snap a little photo of it laughter so then I bring this back into the game it be bear and I play the next generation of my creature through evolution now again the empathy that the player have when they create the content be tremendous when player create content in this game it be automatically send up to a server and then redistribute to all the other player transparently so in fact as I be interact in this world with other creature this creature be transparently come from other player as they play so the process of play the game be a process of build up this huge database of content and pretty much everything you be go to see in this game there be a editor for that the player can create up through civilization this be my baby when I eat I will actually start grow this be the next generation but I be go to skip ahead here normally what would happen be this creature would work they way up eventually become intelligent I would start deal with tribe city and civilization of they over time I be go to skip way ahead to the space phase eventually they would go out into space and start colonize and explore the universe now really in some sense I want the player to be build this world in they imagination and then extract it from they with the least amount of pain so that be kind of what this tool be about how do we make the gameplay you know basically the player imagination amplifier and how do we make this tool this editor something that be just as fun as the game itself so this be the planet that we have be play on up to this point in the game so far the entire game have be play on the surface of this little world here at this point we be actually deal with a very little toy planet almost again like the Montessori toy idea what happen if you give somebody a toy planet and let they play with a lot of dynamics on it what could they discover what might they learn on this this world be actually extract from the player imagination so this be the planet that the player evolve on thing like the building the vehicle the architecture civilization be all design by the player up to this point so here be a little city with some of we guy walk around in it and most game put the player in the role of Luke Skywalker this protagonist play through this story this be more about put the player in the role of George Lucas I want they after they have play this game to have extract a entire world that they be now interact with as we pull down here we still have a whole set of creature live on the surface of the planet all this different dynamics go on here I can look over here and this be a little simplified food web that be go on with the creature I can open this up and then scan what exist on the surface you get some sense of the diversity of creature that be bring in some of this be create by the player other by other player automatically send over here but there be a very simple calculation of what be require how many plant be require for the herbivore to live how many herbivore for the carnivore to eat etc that you have to balance actively also with this phase we be get more and more God like power for the player and you can experiment with this planet as a toy so I can come in and I can do thing and just treat this planet as a lump of clay we have very simple weather system simple geology for instance I could open one of my tool here and then carve out river so this whole thing be kind of like a big lump of clay a sculpture I can also play with the dynamics in this world over time so one of the thing I can do be start pump more co2 gas into the atmosphere and so that be what I be do here there be actually a little readout down there of we planetary atmosphere pressure and temperature so as I start pump in more atmosphere we be go to start push up the greenhouse gas here and if you will start notice we start see the ocean level rise over time and we city be go to be at risk too because a lot of this be coastal city you can see the ocean level be rise now and as they encroach upon the city I will start lose city here so basically I want the player to be able to experiment and explore a huge amount of failure space so there go one city now over time this be go to heat up the planet so at first what we be go to see be a global ocean rise here on this little toy planet but then over time I can speed it up we will see the heat impact of that as well not only will it get hot but at some point it be go to get so hot the ocean will evaporate they will go up and then they will evaporate and that will be my planet so basically what we be get here be the sequel to a Inconvenient Truth in about two minute and that actually bring up a interesting point about game now here we entire ocean be evaporate off the surface and as it keep get hot at some point the entire planet be go to melt down here it go so we be not only simulate biological dynamics food web and all that but also geologic you know on a very simple core scale and what be interesting to I about game be that I think we can take a lot of long term dynamics and compress they into very short term experience because it be so hard for person to think 50 or 100 year out but when you can give they a toy and they can experience this long term dynamics in just a few minute I think it be a entirely different point of view where we be actually use the game to remap we intuition it be almost in the same way that a telescope or microscope recalibrate you eyesight I think computer simulation can recalibrate you instinct across vast scale of both space and time so here be we little solar system as we pull away from we melt planet here we actually have a couple of other planet in this solar system let fly to another one we be go to have this unlimited number of world you can explore here as we move into the future and we start go out into space and do stuff we be draw a lot from thing like science fiction and all my favorite science fiction movie I want to play out here as different dynamics this planet actually have some life on it here it be some indigenous life down here one of the tool I can eventually earn for my UFO be a monolith that I can drop down laughter now as you can see this guy be actually start to go up and bow to it and over time once they touch it they will become intelligent so I can actually pick a species on a planet and then make they sentient now they have actually go to tribal dynamics and now because I be actually the one here I can get out of the UFO and walk up and they should be worship I at this point as a god at first they be a little freaked out ok well maybe they be not worship I laughter I think I will leave before they get hostile but we basically want a diversity of activity the player can play through this I want to be able to play the Day the Earth stand still 2001 a space odyssey Star Trek War of the Worlds now as we pull away from this world we be go to keep pull away from the star now one of the thing that always frustrate I about astronomy when I be a kid be how it be always present so two dimensionally and so static as we pull away from the star here we be actually go now out into interstellar space and we be get a sense of the space around we home star what I really want to do be to present this basically as wonderfully 3d as it be actually be and also show the dynamics and a lot of the interesting object that you might find like in the Hubble at pretty much realistic frequency and scale so most person have no idea of the difference between a emission nebula and a planetary nebula but this be the thing that we can put in this little galaxy here so we be fly over here to what look like a black hole I want to basically have the entire zoo of Hubble object that person can interact with and play with again as toy so here be a little black hole that we probably do not want to get too close to but we also have star and thing as well if we pull all the way back we start see the entire galaxy here kind of slowly in motion typically when person present galaxy it be always beautiful photo but they be always static and when you bring it forward in time and start animate it it be amazing what a galaxy would look like fast forward this would be about a million year a second because you have about one supernova every century and so you would have this wonderful sparkling thing with the disk slowly rotate and this be roughly what it would look like part of this be about bring the beauty of the natural world to somebody in a very imaginative way so that they can start calibrate they instinct across this vast scale of space and time Chris be wonder what kind of god the player would become because if you think about it you be go to have 15 year old 20 year old fly around this universe they might be a nurture god they might be bootstrapp life on planet try to terraform and spread civilization you might be a vengeful god conquesting because you actually can do that you can attack other intelligent race you might be a networking god build alliance or just curious go around and want to explore as much as you possibly can but basically the reason why I make toy like this be because I think if there be one difference I could possibly make in the world that I would choose to make it be that I would like to somehow give person just a little bit good calibration on long term think because I think most of the problem that we world be face right now be the result of short term thinking and the fact that it be so hard for we to think 50 100 or 1 000 year out and I think by give kid toy like this and let they replay dynamics very long term dynamics over the short term and get some sense of what we be do now what it be go to be like in 100 year I think probably be the most effective thing I can be do to help the world and so that be why I think that toy can change the world thank you
