what be bioenergy Bioenergy be not ethanol Bioenergy be not global warming Bioenergy be something which seem counterintuitive Bioenergy be oil it be gas it be coal and part of build that bridge to the future to the point where we can actually see the ocean in a rational way or put up this geo spatial orbit that will twirl or do microwave or stuff be go to depend on how we understand bioenergy and manage it and to do that you really have to look first at agriculture so we have be plant stuff for 11 000 year and in the measure that we plant stuff what we learn from agriculture be you have get to deal with pest you have get to deal with all type of awful thing you have get to cultivate stuff in the measure that you learn how to use water to cultivate then you be go to be able to spread beyond the Nile you be go to be able to power stuff so irrigation make a difference irrigation start to make you be allow to plant stuff where you want it as oppose to where the river flood you start get this organic agriculture you start put machinery onto this stuff Machinery with a whole bunch of water lead to very large scale agriculture you put together machine and water and you get landscape that look like this and then you get sale that look like this it be brute force so what you have be do in agriculture be you start out with something that be a reasonably natural system you start tame that natural system you put a lot of force behind that natural system you put a whole bunch of pesticide and herbicide laughter behind that natural system and you end up with system that look like this and it be all brute force and that be the way we have be approach energy so the lesson in agriculture be that you can actually change the system that be base on brute force as you start merge that system and learning that system and actually apply biology and you move from a discipline of engineering you move from a discipline of chemistry into a discipline of biology and probably one of the most important human being on the planet be this guy behind I this be a guy call Norman Borlaug He win the Nobel Prize he be get the Congressional Medal of Honor he deserve all of this stuff and he deserve this stuff because he probably have feed more person than any other human being alive because he research how to put biology behind seed he do this in Mexico the reason why India and China no long have this massive famine be because Norman Borlaug teach they how to grow grain in a more efficient way and launch the Green Revolution that be something that a lot of person have criticize but of course that be person who do not realize that China and India instead of have huge amount of starve person be export grain and the irony of this particular system be the place where he do the research which be Mexico do not adopt this technology ignore this technology talk about why this technology should be think about but not really apply and Mexico remain one of the large grain importer on the planet because it do not apply technology that be discover in Mexico and in fact have not recognize this man to the point where there be not statue of this man all over Mexico there be in China and India and the Institute that this guy run have now move to India that be the difference between adopt technology and discuss technology now it be not just that this guy feed a huge amount of person in the world it be that this be the net effect in term of what technology do if you understand biology what happen in agriculture well if you take agriculture over a century agriculture in about 1900 would have be recognizable to somebody plant a thousand year early yeah the plow look different the machine be tractor or stuff instead of mule but the farmer would have understand this be what the guy do this be why he be do it this be where he be go what really start to change in agriculture be when you start move from this brute force engineering and chemistry into biology and that be where you get you productivity increase and as you do that stuff here be what happen to productivity basically you go from 250 hour to produce 100 bushel to 40 to 15 to five agricultural labor productivity increase seven time 1950 to 2000 whereas the rest of the economy increase about 2 5 time this be a absolutely massive increase in how much be produce per person the effect of this of course be it be not just amber wave of grain it be mountain of stuff and 50 percent of the EU budget be go to subsidize agriculture from mountain of stuff that person have overproduce this would be a good outcome for energy and of course by now you be probably say to yourself Self I think I come to a talk about energy and here be this guy talk about biology so where be the link between this two thing one of the irony of this whole system be we be discuss what to do about a system that we do not understand we do not even know what oil be we do not know where oil come from I mean literally it be still a source of debate what this black river of stuff be and where it come from the good assumption and one of the good guess in this stuff be that this stuff come out of this stuff that this thing absorb sunlight rot under pressure for million of year and you get this black river now the interesting thing about that thesis if that thesis turn out to be true be that oil and all hydrocarbon turn out to be concentrate sunlight and if you think of bioenergy bioenergy be not ethanol Bioenergy be take the sun concentrate it in amoeba concentrate it in plant and maybe that be why you get this rainbow and as you be look at this system if hydrocarbon be concentrated sunlight then bioenergy work in a different way and we have get to start think of oil and other hydrocarbon as part of this solar panel maybe that be one of the reason why if you fly over west Texas the type of well that you be begin to see do not look unlike that picture of Kansas and that irrigate plot this be how you farm oil and as you think of farming oil and how oil have evolve we start with this brute force approach and then what do we learn then we learn we have to go big and then what would we learn then we have to go even big and we be get really destructive as we be go out and farm this bioenergy this be the Athabasca tar sand and there be a enormous amount first of mine the large truck in the world be work here and then you have get to pull out this black sludge which be basically oil that do not flow it be tie to the sand and then you have get to use a lot of steam to separate it which only work at today oil price coal coal turn out to be virtually the same stuff it be probably plant except that this have be burn and crush under pressure so you take something like this you burn it you put it under pressure and likely as not you get this although again I stress we do not know which be curious as we debate all this stuff but as you think of coal this be what burn wheat kernel look like not entirely unlike coal and of course coalmine be very dangerous place because in some of this coalmine you get gas when that gas blow up person die so you be produce a biogas out of coal in some mine but not in other any place you see a differential there be some interesting question there be some question as to what you should be do with this stuff but again coal maybe the same stuff maybe the same system maybe bioenergy and you be apply exactly the same technology here be you brute force approach once you get through you brute force approach then you just rip off whole mountaintop and you end up with the single large source of carbon emission which be coal fire gas plant that be probably not the good use of bioenergy as you think of what be the alternative to this system it be important to find alternative because it turn out that the U S be dwindle in its petroleum reserve but it be not dwindle in its coal reserve nor be China there be huge coal reserve that be sit out there and we have get to start think of they as biological energy because if we keep treat they as chemical energy or engineering energy we be go to be in deep doo doo gas be a similar issue gas be also a biological product and as you think of gas well you be familiar with gas and here be a different way of mining coal this be call coal bed methane why be this picture interesting because if coal turn out to be concentrate plant life the reason why you may get a differential in gas output between one mine and another the reason why one mine may blow up and another one may not blow up may be because there be stuff eat that stuff and produce gas this be a well know phenomenon laughter you eat certain thing you produce a lot of gas it may turn out that biological process in coalmine have the same process if that be true then one of the way of get the energy out of coal may not be to rip whole mountaintop off and it may not be to burn coal it may be to have stuff process that coal in a biological fashion as you do in agriculture that be what bioenergy be it be not ethanol it be not subsidy to a few company it be not import corn into Iowa because you have build so many of this ethanol plant it be begin to understand the transition that occur in agriculture from brute force into biological force and in the measure that you can do that you can clean some stuff and you can clean it pretty quickly we already have some indicator of productivity on this stuff ok if you put steam into coal field or petroleum field that have be run for decade you can get a really substantial increase like a eight fold increase in you output this be just the beginning stage of this stuff and as you think of biomaterial this guy who do part of the sequencing of the human genome who just double the database of gene and proteins know on earth by sail around the world have be think about how you structure this and there be a series of smart person think about this and they have be put together company like Synthetic Genomics like a Cambria like Codon and what that company be try to do be to think of how do you apply biological principle to avoid brute force think of it in the follow term think of it as begin to program stuff for specific purpose think of the cell as a hardware think of the gene as a software and in the measure that you begin to think of life as code that be interchangeable that can become energy that can become food that can become fiber that can become human being that can become a whole series of thing then you have get to shift you approach as to how you be go to structure and deal and think about energy in a very different way what be the first principle of this stuff and where be we head this be one of the gentle giant on the planet he be one of the nice human being you have ever meet he name be Hamilton Smith He win the Nobel for figure out how to cut gene something call restriction enzyme he be at Hopkins when he do this and he be such a modest guy that the day he win he mother call he and say I do not realize there be another Ham Smith at Hopkins do you know he just win the Nobel laughter I mean that be mom but anyway this guy be just a class act you find he at the bench every single day work on a pipette and building stuff and one of the thing this guy just build be this thing what be this this be the first transplant of naked dna where you take a entire dna operating system out of one cell insert it into a different cell and have that cell boot up as a separate species that be one month old you will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff and as you think about this stuff and what the implication of this be we be go to start not just convert ethanol from corn with very high subsidy we be go to start think about biology enter energy it be very expensive to process this stuff both in economic term and in energy term this be what accumulate in the tar sand of Alberta this be sulfur block because as you separate that petroleum from the sand and use a enormous amount of energy inside that vapor steam to separate this stuff you also have to separate out the sulfur the difference between light crude and heavy crude well it be about 14 buck a barrel that be why you be build this pyramid of sulfur block and by the way the scale on this thing be pretty large now if you can take part of the energy content out of do this you reduce the system and you really do start apply biological principle to energy this have to be a bridge to the point where you can get to wind to the point where you can get to solar to the point where you can get to nuclear and hopefully you will not build the next nuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to a earthquake fault laughter just a thought but in the meantime for the next decade at least the name of the game be hydrocarbon and be that oil be that gas be that coal this be what we be deal with and before I make this talk too long here be what be happen in the current energy system 86 percent of the energy we consume be hydrocarbon that mean 86 percent of the stuff we be consume be probably process plant and amoeba and the rest of the stuff and there be a role in here for conservation there be a role in here for alternative stuff but we have also get to get that other portion right how we deal with that other portion be we bridge to the future and as we think of this bridge to the future one of the thing you should ponder be we be leave about two third of the oil today inside that well so we be spend a enormous amount of money and leave most of the energy down there which of course require more energy to go out and get energy the ratio become idiotic by the time you get to ethanol it may even be a one to one ratio on the energy input and the energy output that be a stupid way of manage this system last point last graph one of the thing that we have get to do be to stabilize oil price this be what oil price look like ok this be a very bad system because what happen be you hurdle rate get set very low person come up with really smart idea for solar panel or for wind or for something else and then guess what the oil price go through the floor that company go out of business and then you can bring the oil price back up so if I have one closing and modest suggestion let set a stable oil price in Europe and the United States how do you do that well let put a tax on oil that be a non revenue tax and it basically say for the next 20 year the price of oil will be whatever you want 35 buck 40 buck if the OPEC price fall below that we tax it if the OPEC price go above that the tax go away what do that do for entrepreneur what do it do for company it tell person if you can produce energy for less than 35 buck a barrel or less than 40 buck a barrel or less than 50 buck a barrel let debate it you will have a business but let not put person through this cycle where it do not pay to research because you company will go out of business as OPEC drive alternative and keep bioenergy from happen thank you
