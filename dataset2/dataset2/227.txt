be a child and sort of crawl around the house I remember this Turkish carpet and there be this scene this battle scene this love scene I mean look this animal be try to fight back this spear from this soldier and my mom take this picture actually last week of we carpet and I remember this to this day there be another object this sort of tower piece of furniture with creature and gargoyle and nudity pretty scary stuff when you be a little kid what I remember today from this be that object tell story so storytelling have be a really strong influence in my work and then there be another influence I be a teenager and at 15 or 16 I guess like all teenager we want to just do what we love and what we believe in and so I fuse together the two thing I love the most which be ski and windsurf that be pretty good escape from the drab weather in Switzerland so I create this compilation of the two I take my ski and I take a board and I put a mast foot in there and some foot strap and some metal fin and here I be go really fast on frozen lake it be really a death trap I mean it be incredible it work incredibly well but it be really dangerous and I realize then I have to go to design school laughter I mean look at that graphic there laughter so I go to design school and it be the early 90 when I finish and I see something extraordinary happen in Silicon Valley so I want to be there and I see that the computer be come into we home that it have to change in order to be with we in we home and so I get myself a job and I be work for a consultancy and we would get in to this meeting and this manager would come in and they would say well what we be go to do here be really important you know and they would give the project code name you know mostly from Star Wars actually thing like c3po Yoda Luke so in anticipation I would be this young designer in the back of the room and I would raise my hand and I would ask question I mean in retrospect probably stupid question but thing like what be this cap lock key for or what be this Num Lock key for you know that thing you know do person really use it do they need it do they want it in they home laughter what I realize then be they do not really want to change the legacy stuff they do not want to change the inside they be really look for we the designer to create the skin to put some pretty stuff outside of the box and I do not want to be a colorist it be not what I want to do I do not want to be a stylist in this way and then I see this quote advertising be the price company pay for be unoriginal laughter so I have to start on my own so I move to San Francisco and I start a little company fuseproject and what I want to work on be important stuff and I want to really not just work on the skin but I want to work on the entire human experience and so the first project be sort of humble but they take technology and maybe make it into thing that person would use in a new way and maybe find some new functionality this be a watch we make for Mini Cooper the car company right when it launch and it be the first watch that have a display that switch from horizontal to vertical and that allow I to check my timer discretely here without bend my elbow and other project which be really about transformation about match the human need this be a little piece of furniture for a Italian manufacturer and it ship completely flat and then it fold into a coffee table and a stool and whatnot and something a little bit more experimental this be a light fixture for Swarovski and what it do be it change shape so it go from a circle to a round to a square to a figure eight and just by draw on a little computer tablet the entire light fixture adjust to what shape you want and then finally the leaf lamp for Herman Miller this be a pretty involved process it take we about four and a half year but I really be look for create a unique experience of light a new experience of light so we have to design both the light and the light bulb and that be a unique opportunity I would say in design and the new experience I be look for be give the choice for the user to go from a warm sort of glow kind of mood light all the way to a bright work light so the light bulb actually do that it allow the person to switch and to mix this two coloration and it be do in a very simple way one just touch the base of the light and on one side you can mix the brightness and on the other the coloration of the light so all of this project have a humanistic sense to they and I think as designer we need to really think about how we can create a different relationship between we work and the world whether it be for business or as I be go to show on some civic type project because I think everybody agree that as designer we bring value to business value to the user also but I think it be the value that we put into this project that ultimately create the great value and the value we bring can be about environmental issue about sustainability about low power consumption you know they can be about function and beauty they can be about business strategy but designer be really the glue that bring this thing together so Jawbone be a project that you be familiar with and it have a humanistic technology it feel you skin it rest on you skin and it know when it be you be talk and by know when it be you be talk it get rid of the other noise that it know about which be the environmental noise but the other thing that be humanistic about Jawbone be that we really decide to take out all the techie stuff and all the nerdy stuff out of it and try to make it as beautiful as we can I mean think about it the care we take in select sunglass or jewelry or accessory be really important so if it be not beautiful it really do not belong on you face and this be what we be pursue here but how we work on Jawbone be really unique I want to point at something here on the leave this be the board this be one of the thing that go inside that make this technology work but this be the design process there be somebody change the board put tracer on the board change the location of the ic as the designer on the other side be do the work so it be not about slap skin anymore on a technology it be really about design from the inside out and then on the other side of the room the designer be make small adjustment sketch drawing by hand put it in the computer and it be what I call be design drive you know there be some push and pull but design be really help define the whole experience from the inside out and then of course design be never do and this be the other new way that be unique in how we work be because it be never do you have to do all this other stuff the packaging and the website and you need to continue to really touch the user in many way but how do you retain somebody when it be never do and Hosain Rahman the ceo of Aliph Jawbone you know really understand that you need a different structure so in a way the different structure be that we be partner it be a partnership we can continue to work and dedicate ourselves to this project and then we also share in the reward and here be another project another partnership type approach this be call Y Water and it be this guy from Los Angeles Thomas Arndt Austrian originally who come to we and all he want to do be to create a healthy drink or a organic drink for he kid to replace the high sugar content soda that he be try to get they away from so we work on this bottle and it be completely symmetrical in every dimension and this allow the bottle to turn into a game the bottle connect together and you can create different shape different form laughter applause thank you applause and then while we be do this the shape of the bottle upside down remind we of a y and then we think well this word why and why not be probably the most important word that kid ask so we call it Y Water and so this be another place where it all come together in the same room the three dimensional design the idea the brand it all become deeply connected and then the other thing about this project be we bring intellectual property we bring a marketing approach we bring all this stuff but I think at the end of the day what we bring be this value and this value create a soul for the company we work with and it be especially rewarding when you design work become a creative endeavor when other can be creative and do more with it here be another project which I think really emulate that this be the one laptop per child the 100 laptop this picture be incredible in Nigeria person carry they most precious belongings on they head this girl be go to school with a laptop on she head I mean to I it just mean so much but when Nicholas Negroponte and he have speak about this project a lot he be the founder of OLPC come to we about two and a half year ago there be some clear idea he want to bring education and he want to bring technology and that be pillar of he life but also pillar of the mission of one laptop per child but the third pillar that he talk about be design and at the time I be not really work on computer I do not really want to from the previous adventure but what he say be really significant be that design be go to be why the kid be go to love this product how we be go to make it low cost robust and plus he say he be go to get rid of the cap lock key laughter and the Num Lock key too so I be convinced we design it to be iconic to look different to look like it be for a kid but not like a toy and then the integration of all this great technology which you have hear about the Wi Fi antenna that allow the kid to connect the screen which you can read in sunlight the keyboard which be make out of rubber and it be protect from the environment you know all this great technology really happen because of the passion and the OLPC person and the engineer they fight the supplier they fight the manufacturer I mean they fight like animal for this to remain they way it be and in a way it be that will that make project like this one allow the process from not destroy the original idea and I think this be something really important so now you get this picture you get up in the morning and you see the kid in Nigeria and you see they in Uruguay with they computer and in Mongolia and we go away from obviously the beige I mean it be colorful it be fun in fact you can see each logo be a little bit different it be because we be able to run during the manufacturing process 20 color for the x and the o which be the name of the computer and by mix they on the manufacturing floor you get 20 time 20 you get 400 different option there so the lesson from see the kid use they in the develop world be incredible but this be my nephew Anthony in Switzerland and he have the laptop for a afternoon and I have to take it back it be hard laughter and it be a prototype and a month and a half later I come back to Switzerland and there he be play with he own version laughter like paper paper and cardboard so I be go to finish with one last project and this be a little bit more of adult play laughter some of you might have hear about the New York City condom it be actually just launch actually launch on Valentine Day February 14 about 10 day ago so the Department of Health in New York come to we and they need a way to distribute 36 million condom for free to the citizen of New York so a pretty big endeavor and we work on the dispenser this be the dispenser there be this friendly shape it be a little bit like design a fire hydrant and it have to be easily serviceable you have to know where it be and what it do and we also design the condom themselves and I be just in New York at the launch and I go to see all this place where they be install this be at a puerto rican little mom and pop store at a bar in Christopher Street at a pool hall I mean they be be install in homeless clinic everywhere of course club and disco too and here be the public service announcement for this project music laughter get some applause so this be really where design be able to create a conversation I be in this venue and person be you know really into get they they be excited it be break the ice it be get over a stigma and I think that be also what design can do so I be go to throw some condom in the room and whatnot but I be not sure it be the etiquette here laughter yeah all right all right I have only a few laughter applause so I have more you can always ask I for some more later laughter and if anybody ask why you be carry a condom you can just say you like the design laughter so I will finish with just one thought if we all work together on create value but if we really keep in mind the value of the work that we do I think we can change the work that we do we can change this value can change the company we work with and eventually together maybe we can change the world so thank you applause
