I be list on the online biography that say I be a design missionary that be a bit lofty I be really more of something like a street walker I spend a lot of time in urban area look for design and study design in the public sector I take about 5 000 photograph a year and I think that I would edit from this and try to come up with some image that might be appropriate and interesting to you and I use three criterion the first be I think I would talk about real design within reach design that be free not design not quite within reach as we be fondly know by we competition and competitor but stuff that you can find on the street stuff that be free stuff that be available to all person and stuff that probably contain some other important message I will use this sidewalk in Rio as a example a very common public design do in the 50 it be get a nice kind of flow organic form very consistent with the Brazilian culture I think good design add to culture wholly inconsistent with San Francisco or New York but I think this be my sort of information highway I live in much more of a analog world where pedestrian traffic and interaction and diversity exchange and where I think the simple thing under we foot have a great amount of mean to we how do I get start in this business I be a ceramic designer for about 10 year and just love utilitarian form simple thing that we use every day little composition of color and surface on form this lead I to start a company call design within Reach a company deal with simple form make good designer available to we and also sell the personality and character of the designer as well and it seem to have work a couple of year into the process I spend a lot of time in Europe travel around look for design and I have a bit of a wake up call in Amsterdam I be there go into the design store and mix with we crowd of designer and I recognize that a whole lot of stuff pretty much look the same and the effect of globalization have have that in we community also we know a lot about what be go on with design around the world and it be get increasingly more difficult to find design that reflect a unique culture I be walk around on the street of Amsterdam and I recognize you know the big story from Amsterdam be not what be in the design store it be what be out on the street and maybe it be self explanatory but a city that have not be take over by modernism that be preserve its kind of architecture and character and where the bicycle play a important part of the way in which person get around and where pedestrian right be protect and I write a newsletter that go out every week and I write a article about this and it get such enormous response that I realize that design that common design that be in the public area mean a lot to person and establish kind of a groundwork and a dialog I then kind of thought about the other city in Europe where I spend a lot of time look for design like Basel where Vitra be locate or in northern Italy all city where there be a whole lot of bicycle and where pedestrian area and I come to the conclusion that perhaps there be something about this important design center that deal with bicycle and foot traffic and I be sure the skeptic eye would say no the correlation there be that there be university and school where person can not afford car but it do seem that in many of this area pedestrian traffic be protect you would not look at this and call this a designer bike a designer bike be make of titanium or molybdenum but I begin look at design in a place like Amsterdam and recognize you know the first job of design be to serve a social purpose and so I look at this bike as not be a designer bike but be a very good example of design and since that time in Amsterdam I spend a increase amount of time in the city look at design for common evidence of design that really be not under so much of a designer signature I be in Buenos Aires very recently and I go to see this bridge by Santiago Calatrava he be a Spanish architect and designer and the tourist brochure point I in the direction of this bridge I love bridge metaphorically and symbolically and structurally and it be a bit of a disappointment because of the sludge from the river be encrust on it it really be not in use and I recognize that oftentimes design when you be set up to see design it can be a bit of a letdown but there be lot of other thing go on in this area it be a kind of construction zone a lot of building be go up and approach a building from a distance you do not see too much you get a little close and you arrive at a nice little composition that might remind you of a Mondrian or a Diebenkorn or something but to I it be a example of industrial material with a little bit of color and animation and a nice little still life kind of unintended piece of design and go a little close you get a different perspective I find this little vignette this little accidental piece of design to be refresh they give I I do not know a sense of correctness in the world and some visual delight in the knowledge that the building will probably never look as good as this simple industrial scaffolding that be there to serve down the road there be another build a nice visual structure horizontal vertical element little decorative line go across this magenta squiggle the workman be reduce to decorative element just a nice kind of breakup of the urban place and you know that no long exist you have capture it for a moment and find this little still life like listen to little song or something it give I a enormous amount of pleasure Antoine Predock design a wonderful ball stadium in San Diego call Petco Park A terrific use of local material but inside you could find some interior composition some person go to baseball stadium to look at game I go and see design relationship just a wonderful kind of breakup of architecture and the way that the tree form vertical element red be a color in the landscape that be often on stop sign it take you attention it have a great amount of emotion it stare back at you the way that a figure might just a piece of barrier tape construction stuff in Italy Construction site in New York red have this kind of emotional power that be almost a equivalent with the way in which cuteness of puppy and such side street in Italy Red draw I into this little composition optimistic to I in the sense that maybe the public service mailbox door service plumbing it look as if this different public service work together to create some nice little composition in Italy you know almost everything kind of look good simple menu put on a board achieve kind of the sort of balance but I be convince that it be because you be walk around the street and see thing Red can be comical it can draw you attention to the poor little personality of the little fire hydrant suffering from bad civic planning in Havana Color can animate simple block simple material walk in New York I will stop I do not always know why I take photograph of thing a nice visual composition of symmetry curve against sharp thing it be a comment on the way in which we deal with public seating in the city of New York I have come across some other just kind of curious relationship of bollard on the street that have different interpretation but this thing amuse I sometimes a trash can this be just in the street in San Francisco a trash can that be be leave there for 18 month create a nice 45 degree angle against this other relationship and turn a common parking spot into a nice little piece of sculpture so there be this sort of silent hand of design at work that I see in place that I go Havana be a wonderful area it be quite free of commercial clutter you do not see we logo and brand and name and therefore you be alert to thing physically and this be a great protection of a pedestrian zone and the repurposing of some colonial cannon to do that and Cuba need to be far more resourceful because of the blockade and thing but a really wonderful playground I have often wonder why Italy be really a leader in modern design in we area in furnishings they be sort of way at the top the Dutch be good also but the Italian be good and I come across this little street in Venice where the communist headquarters be share a wall with this catholic shrine and I realize that you know Italy be a place where they can accept this different ideology and deal with diversity and not have the problem or they can choose to ignore they but this you do not have war faction and I think that maybe the tolerance of the absurdity which have make Italy so innovative and so tolerant the past and the present work quite well together in Italy also and I think that it be recognizable there and have a important effect on culture because they public space be protect they sidewalk be protect and you be actually able to confront this thing physically and I think this help person get over they fear of modernism and other such thing a change might be a typical street corner in San Francisco and I use this this be sort of what I consider to be urban spam I notice this stuff because I walk a lot but here private industry be really kind of make a mess of the public sector and as I look at it I sort of say you know the publication that report on problem in the urban area also contribute to it and it be just my call to say to all of we public policy will not change this at all private industry have to work to take thing like this seriously the extreme might be in Italy where again there be kind of some type of control over what be happen in the environment be very evident even in the way that they sell and distribute periodical I walk to work every day or ride my scooter and I come down and park in this little spot and I come down one day and all the bike be red now this be not go to impress you guy who Photoshop and can do stuff but this be a actual moment when I get off my bike and I look and I think it be as if all of my biker brethren have kind of get together and conspire to make a little statement and it remind I that to keep in the present to look out for this kind of thing it give I possibility for wonder if maybe it be a yellow day in San Francisco and we could all agree and create some installation but it also remind I of the power of pattern and repetition to make a effect in we mind and I do not know if there be a strong kind of effect than pattern and the way it unite kind of disparate element I be at the art show in Miami in December and spend a couple of hour look at fine art and amazed at the price of art and how expensive it be but have a great time look at it and I come outside and the valet for this car service have create you know quite a nice little collage of this car key and my close equivalent be a group of prayer tag that I have see in Tokyo and I think that if pattern can unite this disparate element it can do just about anything I do not have very many shot of person because they kind of get in the way of study pure form I be in a small restaurant in Spain have lunch one of that nice day where you have the place kind of to yourself and you have a glass of wine and enjoy the local area and the culture and the food and the quiet and feel very lucky and a bus load of tourist arrive empty out fill up the restaurant in a very short period of time completely change the atmosphere and character with loud voice and large body and such and we have to get up and leave it be just that uncomfortable and at that moment the sun come out and through this perforated screen a pattern be cast over this body and they kind of fade into the rear and we leave the restaurant kind of feel o k about stuff and I do think pattern have the capability of eradicate some of the most evil force of society such as bad form in restaurant but quite seriously it be a statement to I that one thing that you do sort of see be the aggressive nature of the industrial world have produce kind of large mass of thing and when you in monoculture and I think the preservation of diversity in culture be something that be important to we the last shot that I have deal with come back to this theme of sidewalk and I want to say something here about I be kind of optimistic you know Post Second World War the influence of the automobile have really be devastate in a lot of we city a lot of urban area have be convert into parking lot in a sort of indiscriminate use a lot of the planning department become subordinate to the transportation department it be as easy to rag on car as it be on Wal Mart I be not go to do that but they be real example in urbanization and the change that be occur in the last number of year and the heighten sensitivity to the importance of we urban environment as cultural center I think that they be that the statement that we make in this public sector be we contribution to a large whole city be the place where we be most likely to encounter diversity and to mix with other person we go there for stimulation in art and all that other thing but I think person have recognize the sanctity of we urban area a place like Chicago have really reach kind of a level of international stature the U S be actually become a bit of a leader in kind of enlightened urban planning and renewal and I want to single out a place like Chicago where I look at some guy like Mayor Daley as a bit of a design hero for be able to work through the political process and all that to improve a area you would expect a city like this to have upgrade flower box on Michigan Avenue where wealthy person shop but if you actually go along the street you find the flower box change from street to street there be actual diversity in the plant and the idea that a city group can maintain different type of foliage be really quite exceptional there be common element of this that you will see throughout Chicago and then there be you big d design statement the Pritzker Pavilion do by Frank Gehry my measure of this as be a important bit of design be not so much the way that it look but the fact that it perform a very important social function there be a lot of free concert for example that go on in this area it have a phenomenal acoustic system but the commitment that the city have make to the public area be significant and almost a international model I work on the mayor council in San Francisco on the International Design Council for Mayors and Chicago be look at as the pinnacle and I really would like to salute Mayor Daley and the folk there I think that I should include at least one shot of technology for you guy this be also in Millennium Park in Chicago where the Spanish artist designer Plensa have create kind of a digital readout in this park that reflect back the character and personality of the person in this area and it be a welcoming area I think inclusive of diversity reflective of diversity and I think this marriage of both technology and art in the public sector be a area where the U S can really take a leadership role and Chicago be one example thank you very much
