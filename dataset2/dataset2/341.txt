you know we be go to do thing a little differently I be not go to show you a presentation I be go to talk to you and at the same time we be go to look at just image from a photo stream that be pretty close to live of thing that snapshot from Second Life so hopefully this will be fascinating you can I can compete for you attention with the strange picture that you see on screen that come from there I think I would talk a little bit about some just big idea about this and then get John back out here so we can talk interactively a little bit more and think and ask question you know I guess the first question be why build a virtual world at all and I think the answer to that be always go to be at least drive to a certain extent by the person initially crazy enough to start the project you know so I can give you a little bit of first background just on I and what move I as a really go back as far as a teenager and then a adult to actually try and build this kind of thing I be a very creative kid who read a lot and get into electronics first and then later program computer when I be really young I be just always try to make thing I be just obsess with take thing apart and build thing and just anything I could do with my hand or with wood or electronics or metal or anything else and so for example and it be a great second life thing I have a bedroom and every kid you know as a teenager have get he bedroom he retreat to but I want my door I think it would be cool if my door go up rather than open like on Star Trek I think it would be neat to do that and so I get up in the ceiling and I cut through the ceiling joist much to my parent delight and put the door you know be pull up through the ceiling I build I put a garage door opener up in the Attic that would pull this door up you can imagine the amount of time that it take I to do this to the house and the displeasure of my parent the thing that be always strike to I be that we as person could have so many really amazing idea about thing we would like to do but be so often unable in the real world to actually do that thing to actually cobble together the material and go through the actual execution phase of build something that you imagine from a design perspective and so for I I know that when the internet come around and I be do computer programming and just you know just generally try to run my own little company and figure out what to do with the internet and with computer I be just immediately strike by how the ultimate thing that you would really want to do with the internet and with computer would be to use the internet and connect computer to simulate a world to sort of recreate the law of physics and the rule of how thing go together the sort of the idea of atom and how to make thing and do that inside a computer so that we could all get in there and make stuff and so for I that be the thing that be so enticing I just want this place where you could build thing and so I think you see that in the genesis of what have happen with second life and I think it be important I also think that more generally the use of the internet and technology as a kind of a space between we for creativity and design be a general trend it be a sort of a great human progress technology be just generally be use to allow we to create in as share and social a way as possible and I think that second life and virtual world more generally represent the good we can do to achieve that right now you know another way to look at that and relate to the content and you know think about space be to connect sort of virtual world to space I think that might be a fun thing to talk about for a second if you think about go into space it be a fascinating thing so many movie so many kid we all sort of dream about explore space now why be that stop for a moment and ask why that conceit why do we as person want to do that I think there be a couple of thing it be what we see in the movie you know it be this dream that we all share one be that if you go into space you would be able to begin again in some sense you would become someone else in that journey because there would not be you would leave society and life as you know it behind and so inevitably you would transform yourself irreversibly in all likelihood as you begin this exploration and then the second thing be that there be this tangible sense that if you travel far enough you can find out there oh yeah you have no idea what you be go to find once you get there into space it be go to be different than here and in fact it be go to be so different than what we see here on earth that anything be go to be possible so that be kind of the idea we as human crave the idea of create a new identity and go into a place where anything be possible and I think that if you really sit and think about it virtual world and where we be go with more and more computing technology represent essentially the likely really tactically possible version of space exploration we be move by the idea of virtual world because like space they allow we to reinvent ourselves and they contain anything and everything and probably anything could happen there you know to give you a size idea about scale you know compare space to Second Life most person do not realize kind of and then this be just like the internet in the early 90 in fact second life virtual world be a lot like the internet in the early 90 today everybody be very excited there be a lot of hype and excitement about one idea or the next from moment to moment and then there be despair and everybody think the whole thing be not go to work everything that be happen with second life and more broadly with virtual world all happen in the early 90 we always play a game at the office where you can take any article and find the same article where you just replace the word second life with web and virtual reality with internet you can find exactly the same article write about everything that person be observe to give you a idea of scale second life be about 20 000 cpus at this point it be about 20 000 computer connect together in three facility in the United States right now that be simulate this virtual space and the virtual space itself there be about 250 000 person a day that be wander around in there so the kind of active population be something like a smallish city the space itself be about 10 time the size of San Francisco and it be about as densely build out so it give you a idea of scale now it be expand very rapidly about five percent a month or so right now in term of new server be add and so of course radically unlike the real world and like the internet the whole thing be expand very very quickly and historically exponentially so that sort of space exploration thing be match up here by the amount of content that be in there and I think that amount be critical it be critical with the virtual world that it be this space of truly infinite possibility we be very sensitive to that as human you know you know when you see it you know when you can do anything in a space and you know when you can not second life today be this 20 000 machine and it be about 100 million or so user create object where you know a object would be something like this possibly interactive ten of million of they be think all the time they have code attach to they so it be a really large world already in term of the amount of stuff that be there and that be very important if anybody play like World of Warcraft World of Warcraft come on like four dvd second life by comparison have about 100 terabyte of user create datum make it about 25 000 time large so again like the internet compare to AOL and the sort of chat room and content on AOL at the time what be happen here be something very different because the sheer scale of what person can do when they be enable to do anything they want be pretty amazing the last big thought be that it be almost certainly true that whatever this be go to evolve into be go to be big in total usage than the web itself and let I justify that with two statement generically what we use the web for be to organize exchange create and consume information it be kind of like Irene talk about Google be datum drive I would say I kind of think about the world as be information everything that we interact with all the experience that we have be kind of we flow through a sea of information and interact with it in different way the web put information in the form of text and image the topology the geography of the web be text to text link for the most part that be one way of organize information but there be two thing about the way you access information in a virtual world that I think be the important way that they be very different and much good than what we have be able to do to date with the web the first be that as I say the well the first difference for virtual world be that information be present to you in the virtual world use the most powerful iconic symbol that you can possibly use with human being so for example c h a I be be the English word for that but a picture of this be a universal symbol everybody know what it mean there be no need to translate it it be also more memorable if I show you that picture and I show you c h a I be on a piece of paper you can do test that show that you will remember that I be talk about a chair a couple of day later a lot good so when you organize information use the symbol of we memory use the most common symbol that we have be immerse in all we life you maximally both excite stimulate be able to remember transfer and manipulate datum and so virtual world be the good way for we to essentially organize and experience information and I think that be something that person have talk about for 20 year you know that 3d that lifelike environment be really important in some magical way to we but the second thing and I think this one be less obvious be that the experience of create consume explore that information be in the virtual world implicitly and inherently social you be always there with other person and we as human be social creature and must or be aid by or enjoy more the consumption of information in the presence of other it be essential to we you can not escape it when you be on Amazon com and you be look for digital camera or whatever you be on there right now when you be on the site with like 5 000 other person but you can not talk to they you can not just turn to the person that be browsing digital camera on the same page as you and ask they hey have you see one of this before because I be think about buy it that experience of like shop together just as a simple example be a example of how as social creature we want to experience information in that way so that second point that we inherently experience information together or want to experience it together be critical to essentially kind of this trend of where we be go to use technology to connect we and so I think again that it be likely that in the next decade or so this virtual world be go to be the most common way as human being that we kind of use the electronics of the internet if you will to be together to consume information you know map in India that be such a great example maybe the solution there involve talk to other person in real time ask for advice rather than any possible way that you could just statically organize a map so I think that be another big point I think that wherever this be all go whether it be second life or its descendant or something broad that happen all around the world at a lot of different point this be what we be go to see the internet use for and total traffic and total unique user be go to invert so that the web and its bibliographic set of text and graphical information be go to become a tool or a part of that consumption pattern but the pattern itself be go to happen mostly in this type of a environment big idea but I think highly defensible so let I stop there and bring John back and maybe we can just have a long conversation thank you John that be great applause John Hockenberry why be the creation the impulse to create Second Life not a Utopian impulse like for example in the 19th century any number of work of literature that imagine alternative world be explicitly Utopian Philip Rosedale I think that be great that be such a deep question yeah be a virtual world likely to be a utopia would be one way I would say it the answer be no and I think the reason why be because the web itself as a good example be profoundly bottom up that idea of infinite possibility that magic of anything can happen only happen in a environment where you really know that there be a fundamental freedom at the level of the individual actor at the level of the Lego block if you will that make up the virtual world you have to have that level of freedom and so I be often ask that you know be there a kind of Utopian or be there a Utopian tendency to Second Life and thing like it that you would create a world that have a grand scheme to it that top down scheme be alienate to just about everybody even if you mean well when you build they and what be more human society when it be control when you set out a grand scheme of rule a new way of person interact or a new way of lay out a city or whatever that stuff historically have never scale much beyond you know I always laughingly say the mall of America you know which be like the large piece of centrally design architecture that you know have be build JH the Kremlin be pretty big pr the Kremlin yeah that be true the whole complex JH give I a story of a tool you create at the beginning in Second Life that you be pretty sure person would want to use in the creation of they avatar or in communicate that person actually in practice say no I be not interested in that at all and name something that you do not come up with that almost immediately person begin to demand pr I be sure I can think of multiple example of both of that one of my favorite I have this feature that I build into second life I be really passionate about it it be a ability to kind of walk up close to somebody and have a more private conversation but it be not instant messaging because you have to sort of befriend somebody it be just this idea that you could kind of have a private chat I just remember it be one of that example of datum drive design I think it be such a good idea from my perspective and it be just absolutely never use and we ultimately I think we have now turn it off if I remember we finally give up take it out of the code but more generally you know one other example I think about this which be great relative to the Utopian idea Second Life originally have 16 simulator it now have 20 000 so when it only have 16 it be only about as big as this college campus and we have we zone it you know we put a nightclub we put a disco where you could dance and then we have a place where you could fight with gun if you want to and we have another place that be like a boardwalk kind of a Coney Island and we lay out the zoning but of course person could build all around it however they want to and what be so amazing right from the start be that the idea that we have put out in the zoning concept basically be instantly and thoroughly ignore and like two month into the whole thing which be really a small amount of time even in Second Life time I remember the user the person who be then use second life the resident come to I and say we want to buy the disco because I have build it we want to buy that land and raze it and put house on it and I sell it to they I mean we transfer ownership and they have a big party and blow up the entire building and I remember that that be just so tell you know that you do not know exactly what be go to happen when you think about stuff that person have build that be popular JH CBGB have to close eventually you know that be the rule pr exactly and it but it close on day one basically in internet time you know a example of something pregnancy you can have a baby in Second Life this be do entirely use kind of the tool that be build into second life so the innate concept of become pregnant and have a baby of course Second Life be at the platform level at the level of the company at Linden Lab Second Life have no game property to it whatsoever there be no attempt to structure the experience to make it Utopian in that sense that we put into it so of course we never would have put a mechanism for have baby or you know take two avatar and merge they or something but person build the ability to have baby and care for baby as a purchasable experience that you can have in Second Life and so I mean that be a pretty fascinating example of you know what go on in the overall economy and of course the existence of a economy be another idea I do not talk about it but it be a critical feature when person be give the opportunity to create in the world there be really two thing they want one be fair ownership of the thing they create and then the second one be if they feel like it and they be not go to do it in every case but in many they be they want to actually be able to sell that creation as a way of provide for they own livelihood true on the web also true in Second Life and so the existence of a economy be critical JH question for Philip Rosedale Right here Audience well first a observation which be that you look like a character JH the observation be Philip have be accuse of look like a character a avatar in Second Life Respond and then we will get the rest of you question pr but I do not look like my avatar laughter how many person here know what my avatar look like that be probably not very many JH be you rip off somebody else avatar with that sort of pr no no I do not one of the other guy at work have a fantastic avatar a female avatar that I use to be once in a while but my avatar be a guy wear chap spiky hair spiky than this Kind of orange hair handlebar mustache kind of a Village People sort of a character so very cool JH and you question Audience Unclear JH the question be there appear to be a lack of cultural fine tuning in Second Life it do not seem to have its own culture and the sort of difference that exist in the real world be not translate into the second life map PR Well first of all we be very early so this have only be go on for a few year and so part of what we see be the same evolution of human behavior that you see in emerge society so a fair criticism be what it be of Second Life today be that it be more like the Wild West than it be like Rome from a cultural standpoint that say the evolution of and the nuanced interaction that create culture be happen at 10 time the speed of the real world and in a environment where if you walk into a bar in Second Life 65 percent of the person there be not in the United States and in fact be speak they you know various and different language in fact one of the way to make money in Second Life be to make really cool translator that you drag onto you body and they basically kind of pop up on you screen and allow you to use Google or Babel Fish or one of the other online text translator to on the fly translate speak I be sorry type text between individual and so the multicultural nature and the sort of cultural melting pot that be happen inside Second Life be quite I think quite remarkable relative to what in real human term in the real world we have ever be able to achieve so I think that culture will fine tune it will emerge but we still have some year to wait while that happen as you would naturally expect JH other question right here audience what be you demographic JH what be you demographic pr so the question be what be the demographic so the average age of a person in Second Life be 32 however the use of second life increase dramatically as you physical age increase so as you go from age 30 to age 60 and there be many person in they sixty use second life this be also not a sharp curve it be very very distribute usage go up in term of like hour per week by 40 percent as you go from age 30 to age 60 in real life so there be not many person make the mistake of believe that second life be some kind of a online game actually it be generally unappealing I be just speak broadly and critically it be not very appealing to person that play online video game because the graphic be not yet equivalent to I mean this be very nice picture but in general the graphic be not quite equivalent to the fine tune graphic that you see in a Grand theft auto 4 so average age 32 I mention 65 percent of the user be not in the United States the distribution amongst country be extremely broad there be user from you know virtually every country in the world now in Second Life the dominant one be if you take the UK and Europe together they make up about 55 percent of the usage base in Second Life in term of psychographic oh man and woman man and woman be almost equally match in Second Life so about 45 percent of the person online right now on Second Life be woman woman use second life though about 30 to 40 percent more on a hour basis than man do mean that more man sign up than woman and more woman stay and use it than man so that be another demographic fact in term of psychographic you know the person in Second Life be remarkably dissimilar relative to what you might think when you go in and talk to they and meet they and I would you know challenge you to just do this and find out but it be not a bunch of programmer it be not easy to describe as a demographic if I have to just sort of paint a broad picture I would say remember the person who be really get into eBay in the first few year of eBay maybe a little bit like that in other word person who be early adopter they tend to be creative they tend to be entrepreneurial a lot of they about 55 000 person so far be cash flow positive they be make money from what I mean real world money from what they be do in Second Life so it be a very build still a creative building thing build you own business type of a orientation so that be it JH you describe yourself Philip as someone who be really creative when you be young and you know like to make thing I mean it be not often that you hear somebody describe themselves as really creative I suspect that be possibly a euphemism for c student who spend a lot of time in he room be it possible laughter pr I be a there be time I be a c student you know it be funny when I get to college I study physics in college and I get really it be funny because I be definitely a more antisocial kid I read all the time I be shy I do not seem like it now but I be very shy move around a bunch have that experience too so I do kind of I think live in my own world and obviously that help you know engage you real interest in something JH so you be on you fifth life at this point pr if you count yeah city so but I do and I do not do I think I do not do as well in school as I could have I think you be right I be not like a obsessed you know get a kind of guy I be go to say I have a great social experience when I go to college that I have not have before a more fraternal experience where I meet six or seven other guy who I study physics with and I be very competitive with they so then I start to get a but you be right I be not a a student JH Last question right here audience in the pamphlet there be a statement JH you want to paraphrase that pr yeah so let I restate that so you be say that in the pamphlet there be a statement that we may come to prefer we digital self to we real one we more malleable or manageable digital identity to we real identity and that in fact much of human life and human experience may move into the digital realm and then that be kind of a horrifying thought of course that be a frightening change frightening disruption I guess and you be ask what do I think about that how do I JH what be you response to the person who would say that be horrifying audience if someone would say to you I find that disturb what would be you response pr well I would say a couple of thing one be it be disturb like the internet or electricity be that be to say it be a big change but it be not avoidable so no amount of backpedal or intentional behavior or political behavior be go to keep this technology change from connect we together because the basic motive that person have to be creative and entrepreneurial be go to drive energy into this virtual world in the same way that it have with the web so this change I believe be a huge disruptive change obviously I be the optimist and a big believer in what be go on here but I think that as even a sober you know the most sober disconnected thinker about this look at it from the side have to conclude base on the datum that with that kind of economic force at play there be definitely go to be a sea change and that change be go to be intensely disruptive relative to we concept of we very live and be and we identity as well I do not think we can get away from that change I think generally we be talk about this I think that generally be present in a virtual world and be challenge by it be survive there have a good life there so to speak be a challenge because of the multiculturality of it because of the language because of the entrepreneurial richness of it the sort of flea market nature if you will of the virtual world today it put challenge on we to rise to we must be good than ourselves in many way we must learn thing and you know be more tolerant and be smart and learn fast and be more creative perhaps than we be typically in we real life and I think that if that be true of virtual world then this change though scary and I say inevitable be ultimately for the good and therefore something that we should ride out but I would say that and many other author and speaker about this other than I have say you know fasten you seat belt because the change be come there be go to be big change JH Philip Rosedale thank you very much applause
