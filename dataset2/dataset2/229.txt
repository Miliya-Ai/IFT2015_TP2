just to put everything in context and to kind of give you a background to where I be come from so that a lot of the thing I be go to say and the thing I be go to do or thing I be go to tell you I have do you will understand exactly why and how I get motivate to be where I be I graduate high school in Cleveland Ohio 1975 and just like my parent do when they finish study abroad we go back home finish university education get a medical degree 1986 and by the time I be a intern house officer I could barely afford to maintain my mother 13 year old car and I be a pay doctor this bring we to why a lot of we who be professional be now as they say in diaspora now be we go to make that a permanent thing where we all get train and we leave and we do not go back perhaps not I should certainly hope not because that be not my vision all right for good measure that be where Nigeria be on the African map and just there be the Delta region that I be sure everybody hear of person get kidnap where the oil come from the oil that sometimes I think have drive we all crazy in Nigeria but critical poverty this slide be from a presentation I give not that long ago Gapminder org tell the story of the gap between Africa and the rest of the world in term of health care very interesting how many person do you think be on that taxi and believe it or not that be a taxi in Nigeria and the capital well what use to be the capital of Nigeria Lagos that be a taxi and you have police on they so tell I how many policeman do you think be on this taxi and now three so when this kind of person and believe I it be not just the police that use this taxi in Lagos we all do I have be on one of this and I do not have a helmet either and it just remind I of the thought of what happen when one of we on a taxi like this fall off have a accident and need a hospital believe it or not some of we do survive some of we do survive malaria we do survive AIDS and like I tell my family and my wife remind I every time you be risk you life you know every time you go to that country and she be right every time you go there you know that if you actually need critical care critical care of any sort if you have a accident of which there be many there be accident everywhere where do they go where do they go when they need help for this kind of stuff I be not say instead of I be say as well as AIDS TB malaria typhoid the list go on I be say where do they go when they be like I when I go back home and I do all kind of thing I teach I train but I catch one of this thing or I be chronically ill with one of that where do they go what be the economic impact when one of they die or become disabled I think it be quite significant this be where they go this be not old picture and this be not from some downtrodden this be a major hospital in fact it be from a major teaching hospital in Nigeria now that be less than a year old in a operating room that be sterilize equipment in Nigeria you remember all that oil yes I be sorry if it upset some of you but I think you need to see this that be the floor ok you can say some of this be education you can say it be hygiene I be not plead poverty I be say we need more than just you know vaccination malaria AIDS because I want to be treat in a proper hospital if something happen to I out there in fact when I start run around say hey boy and girl you be cardiologist in the U S can you come home with I and do a mission I want they to think well there be some hope now have a look at that that be the anesthesiology machine and that be my specialty right anesthesiology and critical care look at that bag it be be tape with tape that we even stop use in the U K and believe I this be current picture now if something like this which have happen in the u k that be where they go this be the intensive care unit in which I work all right this be a slide from a talk I give about intensive care unit in Nigeria and jokingly we refer to it as Expensive Scare because it be scary and it be expensive but we need to have it ok so this be the problem there be no prize for tell we what the problem be be there I think we all know and several speaker before and speaker after I be go to tell we even more problem this be a few of they so what do I do there we go we be go on a mission we be go to do some open heart surgery I be the only brit on a team of about nine American cardiac surgeon cardiac nurse intensive care nurse we all go out and do a mission and we have do three of they so far just so you know I do believe in mission I do believe in aid and I do believe in charity they have they place but where do they go for that thing we talk about early because it be not everyone that be go to benefit from a mission health be wealth in the word of Hans Rosling you get wealthy fast if you be healthy first so here we be mission big trouble Open heart surgery in Nigeria big trouble that be Mike Mike come out from Mississippi do he look like he be happy it take we two day just to organize the place but hey you know we work on it do he look happy yes that be the medical advice the committee chairman say yes I tell you you be not go to be able to you can not do this I just know it look that be the technician we have so yes you go on all right laughter I get he to come with I anesthesia tech come with I from the U K yes let just go work this thing out see that be one of the problem we have in Nigeria and in Africa generally we get a lot of donate equipment equipment that be obsolete equipment that do not quite work or it work and you can not fix it and there be nothing wrong with that so long as we use it and we move on but we have problem with it we have severe problem there he have to get on the phone this guy be always on the phone so what we go to do now it look like all this American be here and yes one brit and he be not go to do anything he think he be British actually and he be actually Nigerian I just think about that we eventually get it work be the truth but it be one of this even old than the one you see the reason I have this picture here this x ray it be just to tell you where and how we be view X ray do you figure where that be it be on a window I mean what be a x ray view box please well nowadays everything be on pax anyway you look at you x ray on a screen and you do stuff with they you email they but we be still use x ray but we do not even have a viewing box and we be do open heart surgery ok I know it be not AIDS I know it be not malaria but we still need this stuff oh yeah echo this be just to get the child ready and the adult ready person still believe in Voodoo Heart disease vsd hole in the heart tetralogy you still get person who believe in it and they come at 67 percent oxygen saturation the normal be about 97 she condition open heart surgery that as she require would have be treat when she be a child we have to do this for adult so we do succeed and we still do we have do three we be plan another one in July in the north of the country so we certainly still do open heart but you can see the contrast between everything that be ship in we ship everything instrument we have explosion because the kit be design and install by person who be not use to it the oxygen tank do not quite work right but how many do we do the first one 12 we do 12 open heart surgical patient successfully here be we very first patient out of intensive care and just watch that chair all right this be what I mean about appropriate technology that be what he be do prop up the bed because the bed simply do not work have you see one of that before no yes do not matter it work I be sure you have all see or hear this before we the willing have be do so much with so little for so long applause we be now qualified to do anything with nothing applause thank you sustainable solution this be my first company this one sole aim be to provide the very thing that I think be miss so we put my hand in my pocket and say guy let just buy stuff let go set up a company that teach person educate they give they the tool they need to keep go and that be a perfect example of one usually when you buy a ventilator in a hospital you buy a different one for child you buy a different one for transport this one will do everything and it will do it at half the price and do not need compressed air if you be in America and you do not know about this one we do because we make it we duty to find out what be appropriate technology for Africa what be appropriately price do the job and we move on Anesthesia machine multi parameter monitor operate light suction this little unit here remember you little 12 volt plug in the car that charge you whatever Game Boy telephone that be exactly how the outlet be design yes it will take a solar panel yes a solar panel will charge it but if you have get main as well it will charge the battery in there and guess what we have a little pedal charger too just in case and guess what if it all fail if you can find a car that be still get a live battery and you stick it in it will still work then you can customize it be it dental surgery you want General surgery you want decide which instrument stock it up with consumable and currently we be work on oxygen oxygen delivery on site the technology for oxygen delivery be not new Oxygen concentrator be very old technology what be new and what we will have in a few month I hope be that ability to use this same renewable energy system to provide and produce oxygen on site Zeolite it be not new zeolite remove nitrogen from air and nitrogen be 78 percent of air if you take nitrogen out what be leave Oxygen pretty much so that be not new what we be do be apply this technology to it this be the basic feature of my device or we device this be what make it so special apart from the award it be win it be portable and it be certify it be register the MHRA and the ce mark for that who do not know for Europe be the equivalent of the FDA in the U S if you compare it with what be on the market price wise size wise ease of use complexity this picture be take last year this be member of my graduating class 1986 it be in this gentleman house in the Potomac for that of you who be familiar with Maryland there be too many of we outside and everybody just to borrow a bit from Hans Hans Rosling he be my guy if the size of the text represent what get the most attention it be the problem but what we really need be African solution that be appropriate for Africa look at the culture look at the person look at how much money they have get African person because they will do it with a passion I hope and lot and lot of that little bit down there sacrifice you have to do it African have to do it in conjunction with everyone else thank you applause
