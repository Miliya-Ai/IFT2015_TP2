I want to start with a story a la Seth Godin from when I be 12 year old my uncle Ed give I a beautiful blue sweater at least I think it be beautiful and it have fuzzy zebra walk across the stomach and Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru be kind of right across the chest that be also fuzzy and I wear it whenever I could think it be the most fabulous thing I own until one day in ninth grade when I be stand with a number of the football player and my body have clearly change and Matt who be undeniably my nemesis in high school say in a booming voice that we no long have to go far away to go on ski trip but we could all ski on Mount Novogratz laughter and I be so humiliate and mortify that I immediately run home to my mother and chastise she for ever let I wear the hideous sweater we drive to the Goodwill and we throw the sweater away somewhat ceremoniously my idea be that I would never have to think about the sweater nor see it ever again fast forward 11 year later I be a 25 year old kid I be work in Kigali Rwanda jog through the steep slope when I see 10 foot in front of I a little boy 11 year old run toward I wear my sweater and I be think no this be not possible but so curious I run up to the child of course scare the live bejesus out of he grab he by the collar turn it over and there be my name write on the collar of this sweater I tell that story because it have serve and continue to serve as a metaphor to I about the level of connectedness that we all have on this earth we so often do not realize what we action and we inaction do to person we think we will never see and never know I also tell it because it tell a large contextual story of what aid be and can be that this travel into the Goodwill in Virginia and move its way into the large industry which at that point be give million of ton of secondhand clothing to Africa and Asia which be a very good thing provide low cost clothing and at the same time certainly in Rwanda it destroy the local retailing industry not to say that it should not have but that we have to get good at answer the question that need to be consider when we think about consequence and response so I be go to stick in Rwanda circa 1985 1986 where I be do two thing I have start a bakery with 20 unwed mother we be call the Bad News Bears and we notion be we be go to corner the snack food business in Kigali which be not hard because there be no snack before we and because we have a good business model we actually do it and I watch this woman transform on a micro level but at the same time I start a micro finance bank and tomorrow Iqbal Quadir be go to talk about Grameen which be the grandfather of all micro finance bank which now be a worldwide movement you talk about a meme but then it be quite new especially in a economy that be move from barter into trade we get a lot of thing right we focus on a business model we insist on skin in the game the woman make they own decision at the end of the day as to how they would use this access to credit to build they little business earn more income so they could take care of they family well what we do not understand what be happen all around we with the confluence of fear ethnic strife and certainly a aid game if you will that be play into this invisible but certainly palpable movement inside Rwanda that at that time 30 percent of the budget be all foreign aid the genocide happen in 1994 seven year after this woman all work together to build this dream and the good news be that the institution the banking institution last in fact it become the large rehabilitation lender in the country the bakery be completely wipe out but the lesson for I be that accountability count get to build thing with person on the ground use business model where as Steven Levitt would say the incentive matter understand however complex we may be incentive matter so when Chris raise to I how wonderful everything that be happen in the world that we be see a shift in zeitgeist on the one hand I absolutely agree with he and I be so thrilled to see what happen with the g8 that the world because of person like Tony Blair and Bono and Bob Geldof the world be talk about global poverty the world be talk about Africa in way I have never see in my life it be thrilling and at the same time what keep I up at night be a fear that we will look at the victory of the g8 50 billion dollar in increase aid to Africa 40 billion in reduce debt as the victory as more than chapter one as we moral absolution and in fact what we need to do be see that as chapter one celebrate it close it and recognize that we need a chapter two that be all about execution all about the how to and if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today it be that the only way to end poverty to make it history be to build viable system on the ground that deliver critical and affordable goods and service to the poor in way that be financially sustainable and scaleable if we do that we really can make poverty history and it be that that whole philosophy that encourage I to start my current endeavor call Acumen Fund which be try to build some mini blueprint for how we might do that in water health and housing in Pakistan India Kenya Tanzania and Egypt and I want to talk a little bit about that and some of the example so you can see what it be that we be do but before I do this and this be another one of my pet peeve I want to talk a little bit about who the poor be because we too often talk about they as this strong huge mass of person yearning to be free when in fact it be quite a amazing story on a macro level four billion person on Earth make less than four dollar a day that be who we talk about when we think about the poor if you aggregate it it be the third large economy on Earth and yet most of this person go invisible where we typically work there be person make between one and three dollar a day who be this person they be farmer and factory worker they work in government office they be driver they be domestic they typically pay for critical goods and service like water like healthcare like housing and they pay 30 to 40 time what they middleclass counterpart pay certainly where we work in Karachi and Nairobi the poor also be willing to make and do make smart decision if you give they that opportunity so two example one be in India where there be 240 million farmer most of whom make less than two dollar a day where we work in Aurangabad the land be extraordinarily parched you see person on average make 60 cent to a dollar this guy in pink be a social entrepreneur name Ami Tabar what he do be see what be happen in Israel large approach and figure out how to do a drip irrigation which be a way of bring water directly to the plant stock but previously it be only be create for large scale farm so Ami Tabar take this and modularize it down to a eighth of a acre a couple of principle build small make it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor this family Sarita and she husband buy a 15 dollar unit when they be live in a literally a three walled lean to with a corrugated iron roof after one harvest they have increase they income enough to buy a second system to do they full quarter acre a couple of year later I meet they they now make four dollar a day which be pretty much middle class for India and they show I the concrete foundation they have just lay to build they house and I swear you could see the future in that woman eye something I truly believe you can not talk about poverty today without talk about malaria bed net and I again give Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard huge kudos for bring to the world this notion of he rage for five dollar you can save a life Malaria be a disease that kill one to three million person a year 300 to 500 million case be report it be estimate that Africa lose about 13 billion dollar a year to the disease five dollar can save a life we can send person to the moon we can see if there be life on Mars why can not we get five dollar net to 500 million person the question though be not why can not we the question be how can we help African do this for themselves a lot of hurdle one production be too low two price be too high three this be a good road in right near where we factory be locate distribution be a nightmare but not impossible we start by make a 350 000 dollar loan to the large traditional bed net manufacturer in Africa so that they could transfer technology from Japan and build this long last five year net here be just some picture of the factory today three year late the company have employ another thousand woman it contribute about 600 000 dollar in wages to the economy of Tanzania it be the large company in Tanzania the throughput rate right now be 1 5 million net three million by the end of the year we hope to have seven million at the end of next year so the production side be work on the distribution side though as a world we have a lot of work to do right now 95 percent of this net be be buy by the U N and then give primarily to person around Africa we be look at building on some of the most precious resource of Africa person they woman and so I want you to meet Jacqueline my namesake 21 year old if she be bear anywhere else but Tanzania I be tell you she could run Wall Street she run two of the line and have already save enough money to put a down payment on she house she make about two dollar a day be create a education fund and tell I she be not marry nor have child until this thing be complete and so when I tell she about we idea that maybe we could take a Tupperware model from the United States and find a way for the woman themselves to go out and sell this net to other she quickly start calculate what she herself could make and sign up we take a lesson from IDEO one of we favorite company and quickly do a prototyping on this and take Jacqueline into the area where she live she bring 10 of the woman with whom she interact together to see if she could sell this net five dollar apiece despite the fact that person say nobody will buy one and we learn a lot about how you sell thing not come in with we own notion because she do not even talk about malaria until the very end first she talk about comfort status beauty this net she say you put they on the floor bug leave you house child can sleep through the night the house look beautiful you hang they in the window and we have start make curtain and not only be it beautiful but person can see status that you care about you child only then do she talk about save you child life a lot of lesson to be learn in term of how we sell goods and service to the poor I want to end just by say that there be enormous opportunity to make poverty history to do it right we have to build business model that matter that be scaleable and that work with African Indian person all over the develop world who fit in this category to do it themselves because at the end of the day it be about engagement it be about understand that person really do not want handout that they want to make they own decision they want to solve they own problem and that by engage with they not only do we create much more dignity for they but for we as well and so I urge all of you to think next time as to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity that we all have to make poverty history by really become part of the process and move away from a we and they world and realize that it be about all of we and the kind of world that we together want to live in and share thank you applause
