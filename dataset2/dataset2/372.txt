Natalie MacMaster I be go to just quickly start out with a little bit of music here applause music applause thank you applause I take my shoe off to dance but maybe I will get at that later anyways I where to start well I be really excited to talk a bit about my own upbringing in music and family and all of that but I be even more excited for you person to hear about Donnell amazing family and maybe even a little bit about how we meet and all that sort of thing but for that of you that may not be familiar with my upbringing I be from Cape Breton Island Nova Scotia eastern Canada which be a very very musical island and its origin come from Scotland with the music and all the tradition the dance the language which unfortunately be die out in Cape Breton the traditional language be Gaelic but a lot of the music come from the Gaelic language and the dancing and the singing and everything and my bloodline be Scottish through and through but my mother and father be two very very musical person my mom teach I to dance when I be five and my dad teach I to play fiddle when I be nine my uncle be a very well known Cape Breton fiddler he name Buddy MacMaster and just a wonderful guy and we have a great tradition at home call square dancing and we have party great party at we house and the neighbor house and you talk about kitchen c ilidh well c ilidh first of all be Gaelic for party but kitchen party in Cape Breton be very common and basically somebody drop into the house and no matter what house you go to in Cape Breton there be a fiddle there guarantee and I would say well there be first of all more fiddler per capita in Cape Breton than anywhere in the world so ten chance to one the fellow who walk in the door could play it so you would have someone come into the house you would invite they to play a tune and lo and behold a little party would start up and somebody would dance and somebody would sing and all that sort of thing so it be a wonderful wonderful way to grow up and that be where my beginning in music come from my surroundings my family just my bloodline in itself and oh I have do lot of thing with my music I have record lot of cd I be nominate for a Grammy and I have win some award and stuff like that so that be awesome but the good part be meet my husband and I have actually know Donnell for probably 12 year now and I be go to get into a little bit of I guess how music bring we together but I be go to introduce you right now to my new husband as of October 5 Donnell Leahy applause applause Donnell Leahy thank you I be kind of new to the TED experience and I be glad to be here but I be just try to put it all together try to figure all you person out and I have be here for a short while and I be start to understand a little bit good so I ask Natalie what do I do and she say just talk about yourself it be kind of boring but I will just tell you a little bit about my family I be one of 11 brother and sister from Lakefield Ontario a hour and a half northeast of Toronto and we grow up on a farm mom and Dad raise beef cattle and I be the old boy there be four girl a little bit old than I we grow up without a television person find that strange but I think it be a great blessing for we we have a television for a few year but of course we waste so much time and the work be not get do so out go the television we grow up play Mom from Cape Breton coincidentally Mom and Natalie mother know each other we grow up play and use to dance together right yeah laughter we grow up play a bunch of we play by ear and I think that be important for we because we be not really expose to a lot of different style of music we learn to play the instrument but we kind of have to come from within or go from within because we do not watch television we do not listen to a lot of radio we go to church and to school sometimes and farm and play music so we be able I think at a very critical age to develop we own style we own self and my mother play my father play and the style that come from the Ottawa Valley in Ontario we call it French Canadian style but it originate in log camp year ago hundred of man would go up for the winter to the camp in Northern Ontario and in Quebec and they be all different culture and the Irish the French Scottish German they have all meet and of course at night they have play card and step dance and play fiddle and over the course of many year the Ottawa Valley fiddle kind of evolve and the Ottawa Valley step dancing evolve so that be I kind of start out with that style and I quickly start do my own thing and then I meet Natalie and I be expose to the great Cape Breton fiddle that be how we meet laughter you tell they laughter NM you want to or no laughter well I guess I have to now well it be just so interesting that Donnell upbringing be very similar to mine and I actually see Donnell play when I be about 12 year old and he and he family come to Inverness which be about 45 minute from where I live and I be just blow away like it be just amazing and you will find out why pretty soon here but I could not believe the fiddle and mom be there with I and she be say Donnell mother come up on stage and dance with she child and mom be say that be Julie MacDonnell I use to dance with she when we be kid little do I think we child would be play instrument you know play music yeah twelve year er 20 year later little do she think she kid would be get married but anyway so then I get a phone call about I do not no seven year later I be 19 first or second year of college and it be Donnell and he say hi you probably do not know I but my name be Donnell Leahy and I say I know you I have a tape of yours at home and he say well I be in Truro which be where I be and he ask I out for supper that

site to the burial site the procession be lead by a piper or a fiddle player I will quickly play a short part of the air and then I be go to get into kind of a crazy tune that be very difficult to

will see it my mom play piano and she learn to play before they have a piano at home in Cape Breton before Mom family have a piano in Cape Breton she learn to play the rhythm on a piece of board and the fiddler would all congregate to play on the cold winter evening and mom would be bang on this board so when they buy a piano they buy it in Toronto and have it take by train and bring in on a horse a horse and sleigh to the house it become the only piano in the region and mom say she could basically play as soon as the piano arrive she could play it because she have learn all this rhythm
