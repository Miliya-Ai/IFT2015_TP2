so person argue vigorously about the definition of life they ask if it should have reproduction in it or metabolism or evolution and I do not know the answer to that so I be not go to tell you I will say that life involve computation so this be a computer program boot up in a cell the program would execute and it could result in this person or with a small change it could result in this person or another small change this person or with a large change this dog or this tree or this whale so now if you take this metaphor of genome as program seriously you have to consider that Chris Anderson be a computer fabricate artifact as be Jim Watson Craig Venter as be all of we and in convincing yourself that this metaphor be true there be lot of similarity between genetic program and computer program that could help to convince you but one to I that be most compelling be the peculiar sensitivity to small change that can make large change in biological development the output a small mutation can take a two wing fly and make it a four wing fly or it could take a fly and put leg where its antennae should be or if you be familiar with the Princess Bride it could create a six finger man now a hallmark of computer program be just this kind of sensitivity to small change if you bank account one dollar and you flip a single bit you could end up with a thousand dollar so this small change be thing that I think that they indicate to we that a complicated computation in development be underlie this amplify large change so now all of this indicate that there be molecular program underlie biology and it show the power of molecular program biology do and what I want to do be write molecular program potentially to build technology and there be a lot of person do this a lot of synthetic biologist do this like Craig Venter and they concentrate on use cell they be cell orient so my friend molecular programmer and I have a sort of biomolecule centric approach we be interested in use dna rna and protein and build new language for build thing from the bottom up use biomolecule potentially have nothing to do with biology so this be all the machine in a cell there be a camera there be the solar panel of the cell some switch that turn you gene on and off the girder of the cell motor that move you muscle my little group of molecular programmer be try to refashion all of this part from dna we be not dna zealot but dna be the cheap easy to understand and easy to program material to do this and as other thing become easy to use maybe protein we will work with that if we succeed what will molecular programming look like you be go to sit in front of you computer you be go to design something like a cell phone and in a high level language you will describe that cell phone then you be go to have a compiler that be go to take that description and it be go to turn it into actual molecule that can be send to a synthesizer and that synthesizer will pack that molecule into a seed and what happen if you water and feed that seed appropriately be it will do a developmental computation a molecular computation and it will build a electronic computer and if I have not reveal my prejudice already I think that life have be about molecular computer build electrochemical computer build electronic computer which together with electrochemical computer will build new molecular computer which will build new electronic computer and so forth and if you buy all of this and you think life be about computation as I do then you look at big question through the eye of a computer scientist so one big question be how do a baby know when to stop grow and for molecular programming the question be how do you cell phone know when to stop grow laughter or how do a computer program know when to stop run or more to the point how do you know if a program will ever stop there be other question like this too one of they be Craig Venter question turn out I think he be actually a computer scientist he ask how big be the minimal genome that will give I a function microorganism how few gene can I use this be exactly analogous to the question what be the small program I can write that will act exactly like Microsoft Word laughter and just as he be write you know bacterium that will be small he be write genome that will work we could write small program that would do what Microsoft Word do but for molecular programming we question be how many molecule do we need to put in that seed to get a cell phone what be the small number we can get away with now this be big question in computer science this be all complexity question and computer science tell we that this be very hard question almost many of they be impossible but for some task we can start to answer they so I be go to start ask that question for the dna structure I be go to talk about next so this be normal dna what you think of as normal dna it be double strand it be a double helix have the as t c and g that pair to hold the strand together and I be go to draw it like this sometimes just so I do not scare you we want to look at individual strand and not think about the double helix when we synthesize it it come single strand so we can take the blue strand in one tube and make a orange strand in the other tube and they be floppy when they be single strand you mix they together and they make a rigid double helix now for the last 25 year Ned Seeman and a bunch of he descendant have work very hard and make beautiful three dimensional structure use this kind of reaction of dna strand come together but a lot of they approach though elegant take a long time they can take a couple of year or it can be difficult to design so I come up with a new method a couple of year ago I call dna origami that be so easy you could do it at home in you kitchen and design the stuff on a laptop but to do it you need a long single strand of dna which be technically very difficult to get so you can go to a natural source you can look in this computer fabricate artifact and he be get a double strand genome that be no good you look in he intestine there be billion of bacterium they be no good either double strand again but inside they they be infect with a virus that have a nice long single strand genome that we can fold like a piece of paper and here be how we do it this be part of that genome we add a bunch of short synthetic dna that I call staple each one have a left half that bind the long strand in one place and a right half that bind it in a different place and bring the long strand together like this the net action of many of this on that long strand be to fold it into something like a rectangle now we can not actually take a movie of this process but Shawn Douglas at Harvard have make a nice visualization for we that begin with a long strand and have some short strand in it and what happen be that we mix this strand together we heat they up we add a little bit of salt we heat they up to almost boil and cool they down and as we cool they down the short strand bind the long strand and start to form structure and you can see a little bit of double helix form there when you look at dna origami you can see that what it really be even though you think it be complicate be a bunch of double helix that be parallel to each other and they be hold together by place where short strand go along one helix and then jump to another one so there be a strand that go like this go along one helix and bind it jump to another helix and come back that hold the long strand like this now to show that we could make any shape or pattern that we want I try to make this shape I want to fold dna into something that go up over the eye down the nose up the nose around the forehead back down and end in a little loop like this and so I think if this could work anything could work so I have the computer program design the short staple to do this I order they they come by fedex I mix they up heat they cool they down and I get 50 billion little smiley face float around in a single drop of water and each one of this be just one thousandth the width of a human hair ok so they be all float around in solution and to look at they you have to get they on a surface where they stick so you pour they out onto a surface and they start to stick to that surface and we take a picture use a atomic force microscope it be get a needle like a record needle that go back and forth over the surface bump up and down and feel the height of the first surface it feel the dna origami there be the atomic force microscope work and you can see that the landing a little rough when you zoom in they have get you know weak jaw that flip over they head and some of they nose get punch out but it be pretty good you can zoom in and even see the extra little loop this little nano goatee now what be great about this be anybody can do this and so I get this in the mail about a year after I do this unsolicited anyone know what this be what be it it be China right so what happen be a graduate student in China Lulu Qian do a great job she write all she own software to design and build this dna origami a beautiful rendition of China which even have Taiwan and you can see it be sort of on the world short leash right laughter so this work really well and you can make pattern as well as shape ok and you can make a map of the Americas and spell dna with dna and what be really neat about it well actually this all look like nano artwork but it turn out that nano artwork be just what you need to make nano circuit so you can put circuit component on the staple like a light bulb and a light switch let the thing assemble and you will get some kind of a circuit and then you can maybe wash the dna away and have the circuit leave over so this be what some colleague of mine at Caltech do they take a dna origami organize some carbon nano tube make a little switch you see here wire it up test it and show that it be indeed a switch now this be just a single switch and you need half a billion for a computer so we have a long way to go but this be very promising because the origami can organize part just one tenth the size of that in a normal computer so it be very promising for make small computer now I want to get back to that compiler the dna origami be a proof that that compiler actually work so you start with something in the computer you get a high level description of the computer program a high level description of the origami you can compile it to molecule send it to a synthesizer and it actually work and it turn out that a company have make a nice program that be much good than my code which be kind of ugly and will allow we to do this in a nice visual computer aid design way so now you can say all right why be not dna origami the end of the story you have you molecular compiler you can do whatever you want the fact be that it do not scale so if you want to build a human from dna origami the problem be you need a long strand that be 10 trillion trillion basis long that be three light year worth of dna so we be not go to do this we be go to turn to another technology call algorithmic self assembly of tile it be start by Erik Winfree and what it do it have tile that be a hundredth the size of a dna origami you zoom in there be just four dna strand and they have little single strand bit on they that can bind to other tile if they match and we like to draw this tile as little square and if you look at they sticky end this little dna bit you can see that they actually form a checkerboard pattern so this tile would make a complicated self assemble checkerboard and the point of this if you do not catch that be that tile be a kind of molecular program and they can output pattern and a really amazing part of this be that any computer program can be translate into one of this tile program specifically count so you can come up with a set of tile that when they come together form a little binary counter rather than a checkerboard so you can read off binary number five six and seven and in order to get this kind of computation start right you need some kind of input a kind of seed you can use dna origami for that you can encode the number 32 in the right hand side of a dna origami and when you add that tile that count they will start to count they will read that 32 and they will stop at 32 so what we have do be we have figure out a way to have a molecular program know when to stop go it know when to stop grow because it can count it know how big it be so that answer that sort of first question I be talk about it do not tell we how baby do it however so now we can use this counting to try and get at much big thing than dna origami could otherwise here be the dna origami and what we can do be we can write 32 on both edge of the dna origami and we can now use we watering can and water with tile and we can start grow tile off of that and create a square the counter serve as a template to fill in a square in the middle of this thing so what we have do be we have succeed in make something much big than a dna origami by combine dna origami with tile and the neat thing about it be be that it be also reprogrammable you can just change a couple of the dna strand in this binary representation and you will get 96 rather than 32 and if you do that the origami the same size but the result square that you get be three time big so this sort of recapitulate what I be tell you about development you have a very sensitive computer program where small change single tiny little mutation can take something that make one size square and make something very much big now this use counting to compute and build this kind of thing by this kind of developmental process be something that also have bearing on Craig Venter question so you can ask how many dna strand be require to build a square of a give size if we want to make a square of size 10 100 or 1 000 if we use dna origami alone we would require a number of dna strand that be the square of the size of that square so we would need 100 10 000 or a million dna strand that be really not affordable but if we use a little computation we use origami plus some tile that count then we can get away with use 100 200 or 300 dna strand and so we can exponentially reduce the number of dna strand we use if we use count if we use a little bit of computation and so computation be some very powerful way to reduce the number of molecule you need to build something to reduce the size of the genome that you be build and finally I be go to get back to that sort of crazy idea about computer build computer if you look at the square that you build with the origami and some counter grow off it the pattern that it have be exactly the pattern that you need to make a memory so if you affix some wire and switch to that tile rather than to the staple strand you affix they to the tile then they will self assemble the somewhat complicated circuit the demultiplexer circuit that you need to address this memory so you can actually make a complicated circuit use a little bit of computation it be a molecular computer build a electronic computer now you ask I how far have we get down this path experimentally this be what we have do in the last year here be a dna origami rectangle and here be some tile grow from it and you can see how they count one two three four five six nine 10 11 12 17 so it be get some error but at least it count up laughter so it turn out we actually have this idea nine year ago and that be about the time constant for how long it take to do this kind of thing so I think we make a lot of progress we have get idea about how to fix this error and I think in the next five or 10 year we will make the kind of square that I describe and maybe even get to some of that self assemble circuit so now what do I want you to take away from this talk I want you to remember that to create life very diverse and complex form life use computation to do that and the computation that it use they be molecular computation and in order to understand this and get a good handle on it as Feynman say you know we need to build something to understand it and so we be go to use molecule and refashion this thing rebuild everything from the bottom up use dna in way that nature never intend use dna origami and dna origami to seed this algorithmic self assembly you know so this be all very cool but what I would like you to take from the talk hopefully from some of that big question be that this molecular programming be not just about make gadget it be not just make about it be make self assemble cell phone and circuit what it be really about be take computer science and look at big question in a new light ask new version of that big question and try to understand how biology can make such amazing thing thank you applause
