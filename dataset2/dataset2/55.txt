I have get apparently 18 minute to convince you that history have a direction a arrow that in some fundamental sense it be good that the arrow point to something positive now when the TED person first approach I about give this upbeat talk laughter that be before the cartoon of Muhammad have trigger global rioting it be before the avian flu have reach Europe it be before Hamas have win the Palestinian election elicit various counter measure by Israel and to be honest if I have know when I be ask to give this upbeat talk that even as I be give the upbeat talk the apocalypse would be unfold laughter I might have say be it okay if I talk about something else but I do not ok so we be here I will do what I can I will do what I can I have get to warn you the sense in which my worldview be upbeat have always be kind of subtle sometimes even elusive laughter the sense in which I can be uplifting and inspiring I mean there be always be a kind of a certain grim dimension to the way I try to uplift so if grim inspiration laughter if grim inspiration be not a contradiction in term that be I be afraid the most you can hope for ok today that be if I succeed I will see what I can do ok now in one sense the claim that history have a direction be not that controversial if you be just talk about social structure ok clearly that be get more complex a little over the last 10 000 year have reach high and high level and in fact that actually sustain a long standing trend that predate human be ok that biological evolution be do for we because what happen in the begin this stuff encase itself in a cell then cell start hang out together in society eventually they get so close they form multicellular organism then you get complex multicellular organism they form society but then at some point one of this multicellular organism do something completely amazing with this stuff which be it launch a whole second kind of evolution cultural evolution and amazingly that evolution sustain the trajectory that biological evolution have establish toward great complexity by cultural evolution we mean the evolution of idea a lot of you have hear the term meme the evolution of technology I pay a lot of attention to so you know one of the first thing you get be a little hand axe generation go by somebody say hey why do not we put it on a stick laughter just absolutely delight the little one next good thing to a video game this may not seem to impress but technological evolution be progressive so another 10 20 000 year and armament technology take you here laughter impressive and the rate of technological evolution speed up so a mere quarter of a century after this you get this ok laughter and this laughter I be sorry it be a cheap laugh but I want to find a way to transition back to this idea of the unfold apocalypse and I think that might do it applause so what threaten to happen with this unfold apocalypse be the collapse of global social organization now first let I remind you how much work it take to get we where we be to be on the brink of true global social organization originally you have the most complex society the hunter gatherer village Stonehenge be the remnant of a chiefdom which be what you get with the invention of agriculture multi village polity with centralized rule with the invention of write you start get city this be blurry I kind of like that because it make it look like a one cell organism and remind you how many level organic organization have already move through to get to this point and then you get to you know you get empire I want to stress you know social organization can transcend political bind this be the Silk Road connect the Chinese Empire and the Roman Empire so you have social complexity span the whole continent even if no polity do similarly today you have get nation state point be there be obviously collaboration and organization go on beyond national bind this be actually just a picture of the earth at night and I be just put it up because I think it be pretty do kind of convey the sense that this be a integrated system now I explain this growth of complexity by reference to something call non zero sumness assume that a few of you do not do the assign read very quickly the key idea be the distinction between zero sum game in which correlation be inverse always a winner and a loser non zero sum game in which correlation can be positive ok so like in tennis usually it be win lose it always add up to zero zero sum but if you be play double the person on you side of the net they be in the same boat as you so you be play a non zero sum game with they it be either for the good or for the bad ok a lot of form of non zero sum behavior in the realm of economics and so on in everyday life often lead to cooperation the argument I make be basically that well non zero sum game have always be part of life you have they in hunter gatherer society but then through technological evolution new form of technology arise that facilitate or encourage the playing of non zero sum game involve more person over large territory social structure adapt to accommodate this possibility and to harness this productive potential so you get city you know and you get all the non zero sum game you do not think about that be be play across the world like have you ever think when you buy a car how many person on how many different continent contribute to the manufacture of that car that be person in effect you be play a non zero sum game with I mean there be certainly plenty of they around now this sound like a intrinsically upbeat worldview in a way because when you think of non zero you think win win you know that be good well there be a few reason that actually it be not intrinsically upbeat First of all it can accommodate it do not deny the existence of inequality exploitation war but there be a more fundamental reason that it be not intrinsically upbeat because a non zero sum game all it tell you for sure be that the fortune will be correlate for good or bad it do not necessarily predict a win win outcome so in a way the question be on what grounds be I upbeat at all about history and the answer be first of all on balance I would say person have play they game to more win win outcome than lose lose outcome on balance I think history be a net positive in the non zero sum game department and a testament to this be the thing that most amaze I most impress I and most uplift I which be that there be a moral dimension to history there be a moral arrow we have see moral progress over time 2 500 year ago member of one Greek city state consider member of another Greek city state subhuman and treat they that way and then this moral revolution arrive and they decide that actually no Greek be human be it be just the Persian who be not fully human and do not deserve to be treat very nicely but this be progress you know give they credit and now today we have see more progress I think I hope most person here would say that all person everywhere be human being deserve to be treat decently unless they do something horrendous regardless of race or religion and you have to read you ancient history to realize what a revolution that have be ok this be not a prevalent view few thousand year ago and I attribute it to this non zero sum dynamic I think that be the reason there be as much tolerance toward nationality ethnicity religion as there be today if you ask I you know why be I not in favor of bombing Japan well I be only half joke when I say they build my car we have this non zero sum relationship and I think that do lead to a kind of a tolerance to the extent that you realize that someone else welfare be positively correlate with yours you be more likely to cut they a break I kind of think this be a kind of a business class morality unfortunately I do not fly trans atlantic business class often enough to know or any other kind of business class really but I assume that in business class you do not hear many expression of you know bigotry about racial group or ethnic group because the person who be fly trans Atlantic business class be do business with all this person they be make money off all this person and I really do think that in that sense at least capitalism have be a constructive force and more fundamentally it be a non zero sumness that have be a constructive force in expand person realm of moral awareness I think the non zero sum dynamic which be not only economic by any mean it be not always commerce but it have drive we to the verge of a moral truth which be the fundamental equality of everyone it have do that as it have move global move we toward a global level of social organization it have drive we toward moral truth I think that be wonderful now back to the unfold apocalypse and you may wonder ok that be all fine sound great moral direction in history but what about this so call clash of civilization well first of all I would emphasize that it fit into the non zero sum framework ok if you look at the relationship between the so call Muslim world and western world two term I do not like but can not really avoid in such a short span of time they be efficient if nothing else it be non zero sum and by that I mean if person in the Muslim world get more hateful more resentful less happy with they place in the world it will be bad for the West if they get more happy it will be good for the West so that be a non zero sum dynamic and I would say the non zero sum dynamic be only go to grow more intense over time because of technological trend but more intense in a kind of negative way it be the downside correlation of they fortune that will become more and more possible and one reason be because of something I call the grow lethality of hatred more and more it be possible for grassroots hatred abroad to manifest itself in the form of organize violence on American soil and that be pretty new and I think it be probably go to get a lot bad this capacity because of trend in information technology in technology that can be use for purpose of munitions like biotechnology and nanotechnology we may be hear more about that today and there be something I worry about especially which be that this dynamic will lead to a kind of a feedback cycle that put we on a slippery slope what I have in mind be terrorism happen here we overreact to it that you know we be not sufficiently surgical in we retaliation lead to more hatred abroad more terrorism we overreact because be human we feel like retaliate and it get bad and bad and bad you could call this the positive feedback of negative vibe but I think in something so spooky we really should not have the word positive there at all even in a technical sense so let call it the death spiral of negativity laughter I assure you if it happen at the end both the West and the Muslim world will have suffer so what do we do well first of all we can do a lot more with arm control the international regulation of dangerous technology I have a whole global governance sermon that I will spare you right now because I do not think that be go to be enough anyway although it be essential I think we be go to have to have a major round of moral progress in the world I think you be just go to have to see less hatred among group less bigotry and you know racial group religious group whatever I have get to admit I feel silly say that it sound so kind of Pollyannaish I feel like Rodney King you know say why can not we all just get along but hey I do not really see any alternative give the way I read the situation there be go to have to be moral progress there be go to have to be a lessening of the amount of hatred in the world give how dangerous it be become in my defense I would say as naive as this may sound it be ultimately grind in cynicism that be to say laughter thank you thank you that be to say remember my whole view of morality be that it boil down to self interest it be when person fortune be correlate it be when you welfare conduce to mine that I decide oh yeah I be all in favor of you welfare that be what be responsible for this growth of this moral progress so far and I be say we once again have a correlation of fortune and if person respond to it intelligently we will see the development of tolerance and so on the norm that we need you know we will see the further evolution of this kind of business class morality so this two thing you know if they get person attention and drive home the positive correlation and person do what be in they self interest which be further the moral evolution then they could actually have a constructive effect and that be why I lump grow lethality of hatred and death spiral of negativity under the general rubric reason to be cheerful laughter do the good I can ok laughter I never call myself Mr Uplift I be just do what I can here laughter now launch a moral revolution have get to be hard right I mean what do you do and I think the answer be a lot of different person be go to have to do a lot of different thing we all start where we be speak as a American who have child whose security 10 20 30 year down the road I worry about what I personally want to start out do be figure out why so many person around the world hate we ok I think that be a worthy research project myself I also like it because it be a intrinsically kind of morally redeeming exercise because to understand why somebody in a very different culture do something somebody you be kind of view as alien who be do thing you consider strange in a culture you consider strange to really understand why they do the thing they do be a morally redeeming accomplishment because you have get to relate they experience to yours to really understand it you have get to say oh I get it so when they feel resentful it be kind of like the way I feel resentful when this happen and for somewhat the same reason that be true understanding and I think that be a expansion of you moral compass when you manage to do that it be especially hard to do when person hate you ok because you do not really in a sense want to completely understand why person hate you I mean you want to hear the reason but you do not want to be able to relate to it you do not want it to make sense right laughter you do not want to say well yeah I can kind of understand how a human being in that circumstance would hate the country I live in that be not a pleasant thing but I think it be something that we be go to have to get use to andwork on now I want to stress that to understand you know there be person who do not like this whole business of understand the grassroots the root cause of thing they do not want to know why person hate we I want to understand it the reason you be try to understand why they hate we be to get they to quit hate we the idea when you go through this moral exercise of really come to appreciate they humanity and good understand they be part of a effort to get they to appreciate you humanity in the long run I think it be the first step toward that that be the long term goal there be person who worry about this and in fact I myself apparently be denounce on national tv a couple of night ago because of a op ed I have write it be kind of along this line and the allegation be that I have quote affection for terrorist now the good news be that the person who say it be Ann Coulter laughter applause I mean if you have get to have a enemy do make it Ann Coulter laughter but it be not a crazy concern ok because understanding behavior can lead to a kind of empathy and it can make it a little hard to deliver tough love and so on but I think we be a lot close to err on the side of not comprehend the situation clearly enough than in comprehend it so clearly that we just can not you know get the army out to kill terrorist so I be not really worried about it so laughter I mean we be go to have to work on a lot of front but if we succeed if we succeed then once again non zero sumness and the recognition of non zero sum dynamics will have force we to a high moral level and a kind of save high moral level something that kind of literally save the world if you look at the word salvation in the Bible the Christian usage that we be familiar with save soul that person go to heaven that be actually a latecomer the original meaning of the word salvation in the Bible be about save the social system Yahweh be we Savior mean he have save the nation of Israel which at the time be a pretty high level social organization now social organization have reach the global level and I guess if there be good news I can say I be bring you it be just that all the salvation of the world require be the intelligent pursuit of self interest in a discipline and careful way it be go to be hard I say we give it a shot anyway because we have just come too far to screw it up now thanks applause
