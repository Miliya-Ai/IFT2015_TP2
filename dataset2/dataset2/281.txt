good afternoon good evening whatever we can go jambo guten Abend bonsoir but we can also ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh that be the call that chimpanzee make before they go to sleep in the evening you hear it go from one side of the valley to the other from one group of nest to the next and I want to pick up with my talk this evening from where Zeray leave off yesterday he be talk about this amazing three year old australopithecine child Selam and we have also be hear about the history the family tree of mankind through dna genetic profiling and it be a paleontologist the late Louis Leakey who actually set I on the path for study chimpanzee and it be pretty extraordinary way back then it be kind of commonplace now but he argument be because he have be search for the fossilize remains of early human in Africa and you can tell a awful lot about what that being look like from the fossil from the shape of the muscle attachment something about the way they live from the various artifact find with they but what about how they behave that be what he want to know and of course behavior do not fossilize he argue and it be now a fairly common theory that if we find behavior pattern similar or the same in we close live relative the great ape and human today then maybe that behavior be present in the ape like human like ancestor some seven million year ago and therefore perhaps we have bring that characteristic with we from that ancient ancient past well if you look in textbook today that deal with human evolution you very often find person speculate about how early human may have behave base on the behavior of chimpanzee they be more like we than any other live creature and we have hear about that during this TED Conference so it remain for I to comment on the way in which chimpanzee be so like we in certain aspect of they behavior every chimpanzee have he or she own personality of course I give they name they can live to be 60 year or more although we think most of they probably do not make it to 60 in the wild Mr Wurzel the female have she first baby when she be 11 or 12 thereafter she have one baby only every five or six year a long period of childhood dependency when the child be nurse sleep with the mother at night and ride on she back and we believe that this long period of childhood be important for chimpanzee just as it be for we in relation to learn as the brain become ever more complex during evolution in different form of animal so we find that learn play a ever more important role in a individual life history and young chimpanzee spend a lot of time watch what they elder do we know now that they be capable of imitate behavior that they see and we believe that it be in this way that the different tool use behavior that have now be see in all the different chimpanzee population study in Africa how this be pass from one generation to the next through observation imitation and practice so that we can describe this tool use behavior as primitive culture chimpanzee do not have a speak language we have talk about that they do have a very rich repertoire of posture and gesture many of which be similar or even identical to ours and form in the same context greeting chimpanzee embrace they also kiss hold hand pat one another on the back and they swagger and they throw rock in chimpanzee society we find many many example of compassion precursor to love and true altruism unfortunately they like we have a dark side to they nature they be capable of extreme brutality even a kind of primitive war and this really aggressive behavior for the most part be direct against individual of the neighboring social group they be very territorially aggressive chimpanzee I believe more than any other live creature have help we to understand that after all there be no sharp line between human and the rest of the animal kingdom it be a very blurry line and it be get more blurry all the time as we make even more observation the study that I begin in 1960 be still continue to this day and this chimpanzee live they complex social life in the wild have help more than anything else to make we realize we be part of and not separate from the amazing animal with whom we share the planet so it be pretty sad to find that chimpanzee like so many other creature around the world be lose they habitat this be just one photograph from the air and it show you the forested highland of Gombe and it be when I fly over the whole area about 16 year ago and realize that outside the park this forest which in 1960 have stretch almost unbroken along the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika which be where the tiny 30 square mile Gombe National Park lie that a question come to my mind how can we even try to save this famous chimpanzee when the person live around the National Park be struggle to survive more person be live there than the land could possibly support the number increase by refugee pour in from Burundi and over the lake from Congo and very poor person they could not afford to buy food from elsewhere this lead to a program which we call TACARE it be a very holistic way of improve the life of the person live in the village around the park it start small with 12 village it be now in 24 there be not time to go into it but it be include thing like tree nursery method of farm most suitable to this now very degraded almost desert like land up in this mountain Ways of control prevent soil erosion Ways of reclaim overused farmland so that within two year they can again be productive working to help the villager obtain fresh water from well perhaps build some schoolroom most important of all I believe be work with small group of woman provide they with opportunity for micro credit loan and we have get as be the case around the world about 95 percent of all loan return empower woman work with education provide scholarship for girl so they can finish secondary school in the clear understanding that all around the world as woman education improve family size drop we provide information about family planning and about HIV AIDS and as a result of this program something happen for conservation what be happen for conservation be that the farmer live in this 24 village instead of look on we as a bunch of white person come to study a whole bunch of monkey and by the way many of the staff be now Tanzanian but when we begin the tacare program it be a Tanzanian team go into the village it be a Tanzanian team talk to the villager ask what they be interested in be they interested in conservation absolutely not they be interested in health they be interested in education and as time go on and as they situation begin to improve they begin to understand ever more about the need for conservation they begin to understand that as the upper level of the hill be denude of tree so you have get this terrible soil erosion and mudslide today we be develop what we call the Greater Gombe Ecosystem this be a area way outside the National Park stretch out into all this very degraded land and as this village have a good standard of life they be actually agree to put between 10 percent and 20 percent of they land in the highland aside so that once again as the tree grow back the chimpanzee will have leafy corridor through which they can travel to interact as they must for genetic viability with other remnant group outside the National Park so TACARE be a success we be replicate it in other part of Africa around other wilderness area which be face with extreme population pressure the problem in Africa however as we have be discuss for the whole of this first couple of day of TED be major problem there be a great deal of poverty and when you get large number of person live in land that be not that fertile particularly when you cut down tree and you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion as desperate population cut down more and more tree so that they can try and grow food for themselves and they family what be go to happen something get to give and the other problem in not only Africa but the rest of the develop world and indeed everywhere what be we do to we planet you know the famous scientist e o Wilson say that if every person on this planet attain the standard of living of the average European or American we need three new planet today they be say four but we do not have they we have get one and what be happen I mean the question here be here we be arguably the most intelligent be that be ever walk planet earth with this extraordinary brain capable of the kind of technology that be so well illustrate by this TED Conferences and yet we be destroy the only home we have the indigenous person around the world before they make a major decision use to sit around and ask themselves how do this decision affect we person seven generation ahead Today major decision and I be not particularly talk about Africa here but the developed world major decision involve million of dollar and million of person be often base on how will this affect the next shareholder meeting and this decision affect Africa as I begin travel around Africa talk about the problem face by chimpanzee and they vanish forest I realize more and more how so many of Africa problem could be lay at the door of previous colonial exploitation so I begin travel outside Africa talk in Europe talk in the United States go to Asia and everywhere there be this terrible problem and you know the kind I be talk about I be talk about pollution the air that we breathe that often poison we the earth be poison we food the water water be perhaps one of the most crucial issue that we be go to face in this century and everywhere water be be pollute by agricultural industrial and household chemical that still be be spray around the world seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience the mangrove be be cut down the effect of thing like the tsunami get bad we have talk about the soil erosion we have the reckless burning of fossil fuel along with other greenhouse gas so call lead to climate change finally all around the world person have begin to believe that there be something go on very wrong with we climate all around the world climate be mix up and it be the poor person who be affect bad it be Africa that already be affect in many part of sub Saharan Africa the drought be so much bad and when the rain do come it so often lead to flooding and add distress and the cycle of poverty and hunger and disease and the number of person live in a area that the land can not support who be too poor to buy food who can not move away because the whole land be degrade and so you get desertification creep creep creep as the last of the tree be cut down and this kind of thing be not just in Africa it be all over the world so it be not surprising to I that as I be travel around the world I meet so many young person who seem to have lose hope we seem to have lose wisdom the wisdom of the indigenous person I ask a question why well do you think there could be some kind of disconnect between this extraordinarily clever brain the kind of brain that the TED technology exemplify and the human heart talk about it in the non scientific term in term of love and compassion be there some disconnect and this young person when I talk to they basically they be either depress or apathetic or bitter and angry and they say more or less the same thing we feel this way because we feel you have compromise we future and there be nothing we can do about it we have compromise they future I have get three little grandchild and every time I look at they and I think how we have harm this beautiful planet since I be they age I feel this desperation and that lead to this program we call root and shoot which begin right here in Tanzania and have now spread to 97 country around the world it be symbolic root make a firm foundation shoot seem tiny to reach the sun they can break through a brick wall see the brick wall as all this problem we have inflict on the planet environmental and social it be a message of hope hundred and thousand of young person around the world can break through and can make this a good world for all live thing the most important message of root and shoot every single one of we make a difference every single day we have a choice every one of we in this room we have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make the very poor have no choice it be up to we to change thing so that the poor have choice as well the root and shoot group all choose three project it depend on how old they be and which country whether they be in a city or rural as to what kind of project but basically we have program now from preschool right through university with more and more adult start they own root and shoot group and every group choose between they three different kind of project to make this a good world recognize that all this different problem be interconnect and impinge on each other so one of they project will be to help they own human community and then if they be able they may raise money to help community in other part of the world one of they project will be to help animal not just wildlife domestic animal as well and one of they project will be to help the environment that we all share and weave throughout all of this be a message of learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves in we family in we community between nation between culture between religion and between we and the natural world we need the natural world we can not go on destroy it at the rate we be we not do have more than this one planet just pick one or two of the project right here in Africa that the root and shoot group be do one or two project only in Tanzania in Uganda Kenya South Africa Congo Brazzaville Sierra Leone Cameroon and other group and as I say it be in 97 country around the world of course they be plant tree they be grow organic vegetable they be work in the refugee camp with chicken and sell the egg for a little amount of money or just use they to feed they family and feel a sense of pride and empowerment because they be no long helpless and depend on other with they vegetable and they chicken it be be use in Uganda to give some psychological help to ex child soldier do project like this be bring they out of themselves once again they be useful member of society we have this program in prison as well so there be no time for more root and shoot now but oh they be also work on HIV AIDS that be a very important component of root and shoot with old kid talk to young one and unwanted pregnancy and thing like that which young person listen to good from other youth rather than adult hope that be the question I get ask as I be go around the world Jane you have see so many terrible thing you have see you chimpanzee decrease in number from about one million at the turn of the century to no more than 150 000 now and the same with so many other animal forest disappear desert where once there be forest do you really have hope well yes you can not come to a conference like TED and not have hope can you and of course there be hope one be this amazing human brain and I mean think of the technology and I have just be so thrilled finally to come to person talk about compost latrine it be one of my hobbyhorse we just flush all this water down the lavatory it be terrible and then talk about renewable energy desperately important do we care about the planet for we child how many of we have child or grandchild niece nephew do we care about they future and if we care about they future we as the elite around the world we can do something about it we can make choice as to how we live each day what we buy what we wear and choose to make this choice with the question how will this affect the environment around I how will it affect the life of my child when he or she grow up or my grandchild or whatever it be so the human brain couple with the human heart and we join hand around the world and that be what TED be help so well with and Google who help we and Esri be help we with mapping in Gombe National Park all of this technology we can use now let link they and it be begin to happen be not it you have hear about it this afternoon it be begin to happen this change this change to see change that we must have if we care about the future and the next reason for hope nature be amazingly resilient you can take a area that be absolutely destroy with time and perhaps some help it can regenerate and a example be the tacare program I tell you where a seemingly dead tree stump if you stop hack they for firewood which you do not need to because you have wood lot then in five year you can have a 30 foot tree and animal almost on the brink of extinction can be give a second chance that be my next book it be inspire and it bring I to my last category of hope and we have hear about this so much in the last two day this indomitable human spirit this determination of person the resilience of the human spirit so that person who you would think would be batter by poverty or disease or whatever can pull themselves up out of it sometimes with a help hand and take they part in society and take they part in change the world and just to think of one or two person out of Africa who be just really inspiring we could make a very long list but obviously Nelson Mandela emerge from 17 year of hard physical labor 23 year of imprisonment with this amazing ability to forgive so that he could lead he nation out the evil regime of apartheid without a bloodbath Ken Saro Wiwa in Nigeria who take on the giant oil company and although person around the world try they good be execute person like this be so inspirational person like this be the role model we need for young African and we need some environmental role model as well and I have be hear some of they today so I be really grateful for this opportunity to share this message again with everyone at TED and I hope that some of we can get together and talk about some of this thing especially the root and shoot program and just a last word on that the young woman who be run this entire conference center I meet she today she come up so excited with she certificate she be in root and shoot she be in the leadership in Dar e Salaam she say it be help she to do what she be do and it be very very exciting for I to meet she and see just one example of how young person when they be empower give the opportunity to take action to make the world a good place truly be we hope for tomorrow thank you applause
