18 minute be a absolutely brutal time limit so I be go to dive straight in right at the point where I get this thing to work here we go I be go to talk about five different thing I be go to talk about why defeat aging be desirable I be go to talk about why we have to get we shit together and actually talk about this a bit more than we do I be go to talk about feasibility as well of course I be go to talk about why we be so fatalistic about do anything about age and then I be go spend perhaps the second half of the talk talk about you know how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism be wrong namely by actually do something about it I be go to do that in two step the first one I be go to talk about be how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension which I be go to define as 30 year apply to person who be already in middle age when you start to a point which can genuinely be call defeat age namely essentially a elimination of the relationship between how old you be and how likely you be to die in the next year or indeed to get sick in the first place and of course the last thing I be go to talk about be how to reach that intermediate step that point of maybe 30 year life extension so I be go to start with why we should now I want to ask a question hand up anyone in the audience who be in favor of malaria that be easy ok ok hand up anyone in the audience who be not sure whether malaria be a good thing or a bad thing ok so we all think malaria be a bad thing that be very good news because I think that be what the answer would be now the thing be I would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria be a bad thing be because of a characteristic of malaria that it share with age and here be that characteristic the only real difference be that age kill considerably more person than malaria do now I like in a audience in Britain especially to talk about the comparison with foxhunting which be something that be ban after a long struggle by the government not very many month ago I mean I know I be with a sympathetic audience here but as we know a lot of person be not entirely persuade by this logic and this be actually a rather good comparison it seem to I you know a lot of person say well you know city boy have no business tell we rural type what to do with we time it be a traditional part of the way of life and we should be allow to carry on do it it be ecologically sound it stop the population explosion of fox but ultimately the government prevail in the end because the majority of the British public and certainly the majority of member of Parliament come to the conclusion that it be really something that should not be tolerate in a civilized society and I think that human aging share all of this characteristic in spade what part of this do person not understand it be not just about life of course laughter it be about healthy life you know get frail and miserable and dependent be no fun whether or not die may be fun so really this be how I would like to describe it it be a global trance this be the sort of unbelievable excuse that person give for age and I mean ok I be not actually say that this excuse be completely valueless there be some good point to be make here thing that we ought to be think about forward planning so that nothing go too well so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix age but this be completely crazy when you actually remember you sense of proportion you know this be argument this be thing that would be legitimate to be concern about but the question be be they so dangerous this risk of do something about age that they outweigh the downside of do the opposite namely leave aging as it be be this so bad that they outweigh condemn 100 000 person a day to a unnecessarily early death you know if you have not get a argument that be that strong then just do not waste my time be what I say laughter now there be one argument that some person do think really be that strong and here it be People worry about overpopulation they say well if we fix age no one be go to die to speak of or at least the death toll be go to be much low only from cross St Giles carelessly and therefore we be not go to be able to have many kid and kid be really important to most person and that be true and you know a lot of person try to fudge this question and give answer like this I do not agree with that answer I think they basically do not work I think it be true that we will face a dilemma in this respect we will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate or a high death rate a high death rate will of course arise from simply reject this therapy in favor of carry on have a lot of kid and I say that that be fine the future of humanity be entitle to make that choice what be not fine be for we to make that choice on behalf of the future if we vacillate hesitate and do not actually develop this therapy then we be condemn a whole cohort of person who would have be young enough and healthy enough to benefit from that therapy but will not be because we have not develop they as quickly as we could we will be deny that person a indefinite life span and I consider that that be immoral that be my answer to the overpopulation question right so the next thing be now why should we get a little bit more active on this and the fundamental answer be that the pro aging trance be not as dumb as it look it be actually a sensible way of cope with the inevitability of age aging be ghastly but it be inevitable so you know we have get to find some way to put it out of we mind and it be rational to do anything that we might want to do to do that like for example make up this ridiculous reason why aging be actually a good thing after all But of course that only work when we have both of this component and as soon as the inevitability bit become a little bit unclear and we might be in range of do something about age this become part of the problem this pro aging trance be what stop we from agitate about this thing and that be why we have to really talk about this a lot evangelize I will go so far as to say quite a lot in order to get person attention and make person realize that they be in a trance in this regard so that be all I be go to say about that I be now go to talk about feasibility and the fundamental reason I think why we feel that aging be inevitable be sum up in a definition of age that I be give here a very simple definition aging be a side effect of be alive in the first place which be to say metabolism this be not a completely tautological statement it be a reasonable statement aging be basically a process that happen to inanimate object like car and it also happen to we despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self repair mechanism because that self repair mechanism be not perfect so basically metabolism which be define as basically everything that keep we alive from one day to the next have side effect that side effect accumulate and eventually cause pathology that be a fine definition so we can put it this way we can say that you know we have this chain of event and there be really two game in town accord to most person with regard to postpone age they be what I be call here the gerontology approach and the geriatrics approach the geriatrician will intervene late in the day when pathology be become evident and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sand of time and stop the accumulation of side effect from cause the pathology quite so soon of course it be a very short term ist strategy it be a lose battle because the thing that be cause the pathology be become more abundant as time go on the gerontology approach look much more promising on the surface because you know prevention be good than cure but unfortunately the thing be that we do not understand metabolism very well in fact we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organism work even cell we be not really too good on yet we have discover thing like for example rna interference only a few year ago and this be a really fundamental component of how cell work basically gerontology be a fine approach in the end but it be not a approach whose time have come when we be talk about intervention so then what do we do about that I mean that be a fine logic that sound pretty convincing pretty ironclad do not it but it be not before I tell you why it be not I be go to go a little bit into what I be call step two just suppose as I say that we do acquire let say we do it today for the sake of argument the ability to confer 30 extra year of healthy life on person who be already in middle age let say 55 I be go to call that robust human rejuvenation ok what would that actually mean for how long person of various age today or equivalently of various age at the time that this therapy arrive would actually live in order to answer that question you might think it be simple but it be not simple we can not just say well if they be young enough to benefit from this therapy then they will live 30 year long that be the wrong answer and the reason it be the wrong answer be because of progress there be two sort of technological progress really for this purpose there be fundamental major breakthrough and there be incremental refinement of that breakthrough now they differ a great deal in term of the predictability of time frame fundamental breakthrough very hard to predict how long it be go to take to make a fundamental breakthrough it be a very long time ago that we decide that fly would be fun and it take we until 1903 to actually work out how to do it but after that thing be pretty steady and pretty uniform I think this be a reasonable sequence of event that happen in the progression of the technology of powered flight we can think really that each one be sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one if you like the incremental advance have add up to something which be not incremental anymore this be the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough and you see it in all sort of technology computer you can look at a more or less parallel time line happen of course a bit late you can look at medical care I mean hygiene vaccine antibiotic you know the same sort of time frame so I think that actually step two that I call a step a moment ago be not a step at all that in fact the person who be young enough to benefit from this first therapy that give this moderate amount of life extension even though that person be already middle aged when the therapy arrive will be at some sort of cusp they will mostly survive long enough to receive improve treatment that will give they a further 30 or maybe 50 year in other word they will be stay ahead of the game the therapy will be improve fast than the remain imperfection in the therapy be catch up with we this be a very important point for I to get across because you know most person when they hear that I predict that a lot of person alive today be go to live to 1 000 or more they think that I be say that we be go to invent therapy in the next few decade that be so thoroughly eliminate age that that therapy will let we live to 1 000 or more I be not say that at all I be say that the rate of improvement of that therapy will be enough they will never be perfect but we will be able to fix the thing that 200 year old die of before we have any 200 year old and the same for 300 and 400 and so on I decide to give this a little name which be longevity escape velocity laughter well it seem to get the point across so this trajectory here be basically how we would expect person to live in term of remain life expectancy as measure by they health for give age that they be at the time that this therapy arrive if you be already 100 or even if you be 80 and a average 80 year old we probably can not do a lot for you with this therapy because you be too close to death door for the really initial experimental therapy to be good enough for you you will not be able to withstand they but if you be only 50 then there be a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and you know laughter eventually get through this and start become biologically young in a meaningful sense in term of you youthfulness both physical and mental and in term of you risk of death from age relate cause and of course if you be a bit young than that then you be never really even go to get near to be fragile enough to die of age relate cause so this be a genuine conclusion that I come to that the first 150 year old we do not know how old that person be today because we do not know how long it be go to take to get this first generation therapy but irrespective of that age I be claim that the first person to live to 1 000 subject of course to you know global catastrophe be actually probably only about 10 year young than the first 150 year old and that be quite a thought alright so finally I be go to spend the rest of the talk my last seven and a half minute on step one namely how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension that will allow we to get to escape velocity and in order to do that I need to talk about mouse a little bit I have a correspond milestone to robust human rejuvenation I be call it robust mouse rejuvenation not very imaginatively and this be what it be I say we be go to take a long live strain of mouse which basically mean mouse that live about three year on average we do exactly nothing to they until they be already two year old and then we do a whole bunch of stuff to they and with that therapy we get they to live on average to they fifth birthday so in other word we add two year we treble they remain lifespan start from the point that we start the therapy the question then be what would that actually mean for the time frame until we get to the milestone I talk about early for human which we can now as I have explain equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity secondly what do it mean for the public perception of how long it be go to take for we to get to that thing start from the time we get the mouse and thirdly the question be what will it do to actually how much person want it and it seem to I that the first question be entirely a biology question and it be extremely hard to answer one have to be very speculative and many of my colleague would say that we should not do this speculation that we should simply keep we counsel until we know more I say that be nonsense I say we absolutely be irresponsible if we stay silent on this we need to give we good guess as to the time frame in order to give person a sense of proportion so that they can assess they priority so I say that we have a 50 50 chance of reach this RHR milestone robust human rejuvenation within 15 year from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation 15 year from the robust mouse the public perception will probably be somewhat good than that the public tend to underestimate how difficult scientific thing be so they will probably think it be five year away they will be wrong but that actually will not matter too much and finally of course I think it be fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public be so ambivalent about age now be the global trance I speak about early the cope strategy that will be history at this point because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging be inevitable in human since it be be postpone so very effectively in mouse so we be likely to end up with a very strong change in person attitude and of course that have enormous implication so in order to tell you now how we be go to get this mouse I be go to add a little bit to my description of age I be go to use this word damage to denote this intermediate thing that be cause by metabolism and that eventually cause pathology because the critical thing about this be that even though the damage only eventually cause pathology the damage itself be cause ongoing ly throughout life start before we be bear but it be not part of metabolism itself and this turn out to be useful because we can be draw we original diagram this way we can say that fundamentally the difference between gerontology and geriatrics be that gerontology try to inhibit the rate at which metabolism lay down this damage and I be go to explain exactly what damage be in concrete biological term in a moment and geriatrician try to hold back the sand of time by stop the damage convert into pathology and the reason it be a lose battle be because the damage be continue to accumulate so there be a third approach if we look at it this way we can call it the engineering approach and I claim that the engineering approach be within range the engineering approach do not intervene in any process it do not intervene in this process or this one and that be good because it mean that it be not a lose battle and it be something that we be within range of be able to do because it do not involve improve on evolution the engineering approach simply say let go and periodically repair all of this various type of damage not necessarily repair they completely but repair they quite a lot so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist that cause it to be pathogenic we know that this threshold exist because we do not get age relate disease until we be in middle age even though the damage have be accumulate since before we be bear why do I say that we be in range well this be basically it the point about this slide be actually the bottom if we try to say which bit of metabolism be important for age we will be here all night because basically all of metabolism be important for age in one way or another this list be just for illustration it be incomplete the list on the right be also incomplete it be a list of type of pathology that be age relate and it be just a incomplete list but I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle be actually complete this be the list of type of thing that qualify as damage side effect of metabolism that cause pathology in the end or that might cause pathology and there be only seven of they they be category of thing of course but there be only seven of they cell loss mutation in chromosome mutation in the mitochondrium and so on First of all I would like to give you a argument for why that list be complete of course one can make a biological argument one can say ok what be we make of we be make of cell and stuff between cell what can damage accumulate in the answer be long live molecule because if a short lived molecule undergo damage but then the molecule be destroy like by a protein be destroy by proteolysis then the damage be go too it be get to be long live molecule so this seven thing be all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that be pretty good news because it mean that you know we have come a long way in biology in this 20 year so the fact that we have not extend this list be a pretty good indication that there be no extension to be do however it be good than that we actually know how to fix they all in mouse in principle and what I mean by in principle be we probably can actually implement this fix within a decade some of they be partially implement already the one at the top I have not get time to go through they at all but my conclusion be that if we can actually get suitable funding for this then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 year but we do need to get serious about it we do need to really start try so of course there be some biologist in the audience and I want to give some answer to some of the question that you may have you may have be dissatisfied with this talk but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff I have publish a great deal on this I cite the experimental work on which my optimism be base and there be quite a lot of detail there the detail be what make I confident of my rather aggressive time frame that I be predict here so if you think that I be wrong you would better damn well go and find out why you think I be wrong and of course the main thing be that you should not trust person who call themselves gerontologist because as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field you know you expect person in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously so you know you have get to actually do you homework in order to understand whether this be true and we will just end with a few thing one thing be you know you will be hear from a guy in the next session who say some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time and everyone say well it be obviously impossible and you know what happen so you know this do happen we have various strategy there be the Methuselah Mouse Prize which be basically a incentive to innovate and to do what you think be go to work and you get money for it if you win there be a proposal to actually put together a institute this be what be go to take a bit of money but I mean look how long do it take to spend that on the war in Iraq not very long ok laughter it be get to be philanthropic because profit distract biotech but it be basically get a 90 percent chance I think of succeed in this and I think we know how to do it and I will stop there thank you applause Chris Anderson ok I do not know if there be go to be any question but I think I would give person the chance audience since you have be talk about age and try to defeat it why be it that you make yourself appear like a old man laughter AG because I be a old man I be actually 158 laughter applause audience species on this planet have evolve with immune system to fight off all the disease so that individual live long enough to procreate however as far as I know all the species have evolve to actually die so when cell divide the telomerase get short and eventually species die so why do evolution have seem to have select against immortality when it be so advantageous or be evolution just incomplete AG Brilliant thank you for ask a question that I can answer with a uncontroversial answer I be go to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to you question which I happen to agree with which be that no aging be not a product of selection evolution aging be simply a product of evolutionary neglect in other word we have aging because it be hard work not to have aging you need more genetic pathway more sophistication in you gene in order to age more slowly and that carry on be true the long you push it out so to the extent that evolution do not matter do not care whether gene be pass on by individual live a long time or by procreation there be a certain amount of modulation of that which be why different species have different lifespan but that be why there be no immortal species ca the gene do not care but we do AG that be right audience hello I read somewhere that in the last 20 year the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet have grow by 10 year if I project that that would make I think that I would live until 120 if I do not crash on my motorbike that mean that I be one of you subject to become a 1 000 year old AG if you lose a bit of weight laughter you number be a bit out the standard number be that lifespan have be grow at between one and two year per decade so it be not quite as good as you might think you might hope but I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible audience I be tell that many of the brain cell we have as adult be actually in the human embryo and that the brain cell last 80 year or so if that be indeed true biologically be there implication in the world of rejuvenation if there be cell in my body that live all 80 year as oppose to a typical you know couple of month AG there be technical implication certainly basically what we need to do be replace cell in that few area of the brain that lose cell at a respectable rate especially neuron but we do not want to replace they any fast than that or not much fast anyway because replace they too fast would degrade cognitive function what I say about there be no non age species early on be a little bit of a oversimplification there be species that have no aging Hydra for example but they do it by not have a nervous system and not have any tissue in fact that rely for they function on very long live cell
