I tell you three thing last year I tell you that the statistics of the world have not be make properly available because of that we still have the old mindset of develop in industrialize country which be wrong and that animated graphic can make a difference thing be change and today on the United Nations Statistic Division Home Page it say by first of May full access to the database applause and if I could share the image with you on the screen so three thing have happen U N open they statistic database and we have a new version of the software up work as a beta on the net so you do not have to download it any long and let I repeat what you see last year the bubble be the country here you have the fertility rate the number of child per woman and there you have the length of life in year this be 1950 that be the industrialize country that be develop country at that time there be a we and they there be a huge difference in the world but then it change and it go on quite well and this be what happen you can see how China be the red big bubble the blue there be India and they go over all this I be go to try to be a little more serious this year in show you how thing really change and it be Africa that stand out as the problem down here do not it large family still and the HIV epidemic bring down the country like this this be more or less what we see last year and this be how it will go on into the future and I will talk on be this possible because you see now I present statistics that do not exist because this be where we be will it be possible that this will happen I cover my lifetime here you know I expect to live 100 year and this be where we be today now could we look here instead at the economic situation in the world and I would like to show that against child survival we will swap the axis here you have child mortality that be survival four kid die there 200 die there and this be gdp per capita on this axis and this be 2007 and if I go back in time I have add some historical statistics here we go here we go here we go not so much statistics 100 year ago some country still have statistics we be look down in the archive and when we be down into 1820 there be only Austria and Sweden that can produce number laughter but they be down here they have 1 000 dollar per person per year and they lose one fifth of they kid before they first birthday so this be what happen in the world if we play the entire world how they get slowly rich and rich and they add statistics be not it beautiful when they get statistics you see the importance of that and here child do not live long the last century 1870 be bad for the kid in Europe because most of this statistics be Europe it be only by the turn of the century that more than 90 percent of the child survive they first year this be India come up with the first datum from India and this be the United States move away here earn more money and we will soon see China come up in the very far end corner here and it move up with Mao Tse Tung get health not get so rich there he die then Deng Xiaoping bring money it move this way over here and the bubble keep move up there and this be what the world look like today applause let we have a look at the United States we have a function here I can tell the world stay where you be and I take the United States we still want to see the background I put they up like this and now we go backwards and we can see that the United States go to the right of the mainstream they be on the money side all the time and down in 1915 the United States be a neighbor of India present contemporary India and that mean United States be rich but lose more kid than India be do today proportionally and look here compare to the Philippines of today the Philippines of today have almost the same economy as the United States during the First World War but we have to bring United States forward quite a while to find the same health of the United States as we have in the Philippines about 1957 here the health of the United States be the same as the Philippines and this be the drama of this world which many call globalize be that Asia Arabic country Latin America be much more ahead in be healthy educate have human resource than they be economically there be a discrepancy in what be happen today in the emerge economy there now social benefit social progress be go ahead of economical progress and 1957 the United States have the same economy as Chile have today and how long do we have to bring United States to get the same health as Chile have today I think we have to go there we have 2001 or 2002 the United States have the same health as Chile Chile catch up within some year Chile may have good child survival than the United States this be really a change that you have this lag of more or less 30 40 year difference on the health and behind the health be the educational level and there be a lot of infrastructure thing and general human resource be there now we can take away this and I would like to show you the rate of speed the rate of change how fast they have go and we go back to 1920 and I want to look at Japan and I want to look at Sweden and the United States and I be go to stage a race here between this sort of yellowish Ford here and the red Toyota down there and the brownish Volvo laughter and here we go here we go the Toyota have a very bad start down here you can see and the United States Ford be go off road there and the Volvo be do quite fine this be the war the Toyota get off track and now the Toyota be come on the healthier side of Sweden can you see that and they be take over Sweden and they be now healthy than Sweden that be the part where I sell the Volvo and buy the Toyota laughter and now we can see that the rate of change be enormous in Japan they really catch up and this change gradually we have to look over generation to understand it and let I show you my own sort of family history we make this graph here and this be the same thing money down there and health you know and this be my family this be Sweden 1830 when my great great grandma be bear Sweden be like Sierra Leone today and this be when great grandma be bear 1863 and Sweden be like Mozambique and this be when my grandma be bear 1891 she take care of I as a child so I be not talk about statistic now now it be oral history in my family that be when I believe statistics when it be grandma verify statistics laughter I think it be the good way of verify historical statistics Sweden be like Ghana it be interesting to see the enormous diversity within sub Saharan Africa I tell you last year I will tell you again my mother be bear in Egypt and I who be I I be the Mexican in the family and my daughter she be bear in Chile and the grand daughter be bear in Singapore now the healthy country on this Earth it bypass Sweden about two to three year ago with good child survival but they be very small you know they be so close to the hospital we can never beat they out in this forest laughter but homage to Singapore Singapore be the good one now this look also like a very good story but it be not really that easy that it be all a good story because I have to show you one of the other facility we can also make the color here represent the variable and what be I choose here Carbon dioxide emission metric ton per capita this be 1962 and United States be emit 16 ton per person and China be emit 0 6 and India be emit 0 32 ton per capita and what happen when we move on well you see the nice story of get rich and get healthy everyone do it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide there be no one who have do it so far and we do not have all the update datum any longer because this be really hot datum today and there we be 2001 and in the discussion I attend with global leader you know many say now the problem be that the emerge economy they be get out too much carbon dioxide the Minister of the Environment of India say well you be the one who cause the problem the OECD country the high income country they be the one who cause the climate change but we forgive you because you do not know it but from now on we count per capita from now on we count per capita and everyone be responsible for the per capita emission this really show you we have not see good economic and health progress anywhere in the world without destroy the climate and this be really what have to be change I have be criticize for show you a too positive image of the world but I do not think it be like this the world be quite a messy place this we can call Dollar Street everyone live on this street here what they earn here what number they live on be how much they earn per day this family earn about one dollar per day we drive up the street here we find a family here which earn about two to three dollar a day and we drive away here we find the first garden in the street and they earn 10 to 50 dollar a day and how do they live if we look at the bed here we can see that they sleep on a rug on the floor this be what poverty line be 80 percent of the family income be just to cover the energy need the food for the day this be two to five dollar you have a bed and here it be a much nice bedroom you can see I lecture on this for Ikea and they want to see the sofa immediately here laughter and this be the sofa how it will emerge from there and the interesting thing when you go around here in the photo panorama you see the family still sit on the floor there although there be a sofa if you watch in the kitchen you can see that the great difference for woman do not come between one to 10 dollar it come beyond here when you really can get good working condition in the family and if you really want to see the difference you look at the toilet over here this can change this can change this be all picture and image from Africa and it can become much good we can get out of poverty my own research have not be in it or anything like this I spend 20 year in interview with African farmer who be on the verge of famine and this be the result of the farmer need research the nice thing here be that you can not see who be the researcher in this picture that be when research function in poor society you must really live with the person when you be in poverty everything be about survival it be about have food and this two young farmer they be girl now because the parent be dead from HIV and AIDS they discuss with a train agronomist this be one of the good agronomist in Malawi Junatambe Kumbira and he be discuss what sort of cassava they will plant the good converter of sunshine to food that man have find and they be very very eagerly interested to get advice and that be to survive in poverty that be one context get out of poverty the woman tell we one thing get we technology we hate this mortar to stand hour and hour get we a mill so that we can mill we flour then we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves Technology will bring you out of poverty but there be a need for a market to get away from poverty and this woman be very happy now bring she product to the market but she be very thankful for the public investment in schooling so she can count and will not be cheat when she reach the market she want she kid to be healthy so she can go to the market and do not have to stay home and she want the infrastructure it be nice with a paved road it be also good with credit Micro credit give she the bicycle you know and information will tell she when to go to market with which product you can do this I find my experience from 20 year of Africa be that the seemingly impossible be possible Africa have not do bad in 50 year they have go from a pre medieval situation to a very decent 100 year ago Europe with a function nation and state I would say that sub Saharan Africa have do good in the world during the last 50 year because we do not consider where they come from it be this stupid concept of develop country that put we Argentina and Mozambique together 50 year ago and say that Mozambique do bad we have to know a little more about the world I have a neighbor who know 200 type of wine he know everything he know the name of the grape the temperature and everything I only know two type of wine red and white laughter but my neighbor only know two type of country industrialize and develop and I know 200 I know about the small datum but you can do that applause but I have to get serious and how do you get serious you make a PowerPoint you know laughter homage to the Office package no what be this what be this what be I tell I be tell you that there be many dimension of development everyone want you pet thing if you be in the corporate sector you love micro credit if you be fight in a non governmental organization you love equity between gender or if you be a teacher you will love UNESCO and so on on the global level we have to have more than we own thing we need everything all this thing be important for development especially when you just get out of poverty and you should go towards welfare now what we need to think about be what be a goal for development and what be the means for development let I first grade what be the most important means economic growth to I as a public health professor be the most important thing for development because it explain 80 percent of survival governance to have a government which function that be what bring California out of the misery of 1850 it be the government that make law function finally Education human resource be important health be also important but not that much as a mean environment be important human right be also important but it just get one cross now what about goal where be we go toward we be not interested in money money be not a goal it be the good mean but I give it zero as a goal governance well it be fun to vote in a little thing but it be not a goal and go to school that be not a goal it be a mean health I give two point I mean it be nice to be healthy at my age especially you can stand here you be healthy and that be good it get two pluss Environment be very very crucial there be nothing for the grandkid if you do not save up but where be the important goal of course it be human right human right be the goal but it be not that strong of a mean for achieve development and culture culture be the most important thing I would say because that be what bring joy to life that be the value of live so the seemingly impossible be possible even African country can achieve this and I have show you the shot where the seemingly impossible be possible and remember please remember my main message which be this the seemingly impossible be possible we can have a good world I show you the shot I prove it in the PowerPoint and I think I will convince you also by culture laughter applause bring I my sword Sword swallow be from ancient India it be a cultural expression that for thousand of year have inspire human being to think beyond the obvious laughter and I will now prove to you that the seemingly impossible be possible by take this piece of steel solid steel this be the army bayonet from the Swedish Army 1850 in the last year we have war and it be all solid steel you can hear here and I be go to take this blade of steel and push it down through my body of blood and flesh and prove to you that the seemingly impossible be possible can I request a moment of absolute silence applause
