thank you so much everyone from TED and Chris and Amy in particular I can not believe I be here I have not sleep in week Neil and I be sit there compare how little we have sleep in anticipation for this I have never be so nervous and I do this when I be nervous I just realize laughter so I be go to talk about sort of what we do at this organization call 826 Valencia and then I be go to talk about how we all might join in and do similar thing back in about 2000 I be live in Brooklyn I be try to finish my first book I be wander around daze every day because I write from 12 a m to 5 a m so I would walk around in a daze during the day I have no mental acuity to speak of during the day but I have flexible hour in the Brooklyn neighborhood that I live in Park Slope there be a lot of writer it be like a very high per capita ratio of writer to normal person meanwhile I have grow up around a lot of teacher my mom be a teacher my sister become a teacher and after college so many of my friend go into teaching and so I be always hear they talk about they life and how inspiring they be and they be really sort of the most hard working and constantly inspire person I know but I know so many of the thing they be up against so many of the struggle they be deal with and one of they be that so many of my friend that be teach in city school be have trouble with they student keep up at grade level in they read and write in particular now so many of this student have come from household where English be not speak in the home where a lot of they have different special need learn disability and of course they be work in school which sometimes and very often be under fund and so they would talk to I about this and say you know what we really need be just more person more body more one on one attention more hour more expertise from person that have skill in English and can work with this student one on one now I would say well why do not you just work with they one on one and they would say well we have five class of 30 to 40 student each this can lead up to 150 180 200 student a day how can we possibly give each student even one hour a week of one on one attention you would have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teacher and so we start talk about this and at the same time I think about this massive group of person I know writer editor journalist graduate student assistant professor you name it all this person that have sort of flexible daily hour and a interest in the English word I hope to have a interest in the English language but I be not speak it well right now laughter I be try that clock have get I but everyone that I know have a interest in the primacy of the write word in term of nurture a democracy nurture a enlightened life and so they have you know they time and they interest but at the same time there be not a conduit that I know of in my community to bring this two community together so when I move back to San Francisco we rent this building and the idea be to put McSweeney McSweeney Quarterly that we publish twice or three time a year and a few other magazine we be go to move it into a office for the first time it use to be in my kitchen in Brooklyn we be go to move it into a office and we be go to actually share space with a tutoring center so we think we will have all this writer and editor and everybody sort of a writing community come into the office every day anyway why do not we just open up the front of the building for student to come in there after school get extra help on they write homework so you have basically no border between this two community so the idea be that we would be work on whatever we be work on at 2 30 p m the student flow in and you put down what you be do or you trade or you work a little bit late or whatever it be you give that hour in the afternoon to the student in the neighborhood so we have this place we rent it the landlord be all for it we do this mural that be a Chris Ware mural that basically explain the entire history of the print word in mural form it take a long time to digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road so we rent this space and everything be great except the landlord say well the space be zone for retail you have to come up with something you have get ta sell something you can not just have a tutoring center so we think ha ha really and we could not think of anything necessarily to sell but we do all the necessary research it use to be a weight room so there be rubber floor below acoustic tile ceiling and fluorescent light we take all that down and we find beautiful wooden floor whitewashed beam and it have the look while we be renovate this place somebody say you know it really kind of look like the hull of a ship and we look around and somebody else say well you should sell supply to the work buccaneer laughter and so this be what we do so it make everybody laugh and we say there be a point to that let sell pirate supply this be the pirate supply store you see this be sort of a sketch I do on a napkin a great carpenter build all this stuff and you see we make it look sort of pirate supply like here you see plank sell by the foot and we have supply to combat scurvy we have the peg leg there that be all handmade and fit to you up at the top you see the eyepatch display which be the black column there for everyday use for you eyepatch and then you have the pastel and other color for step out at night special occasion bar mitzvah and whatever so we open this place and this be a vat that we fill with treasure that student dig in this be replacement eye in case you lose one this be some sign that we have all over the place practical joke with Pirates while you be read the sign we pull a rope behind the counter and eight mop head drop on you head that be just my one thing I say we have to have something that drop on person head it become mop head and this be the fish theater which be just a saltwater tank with three seat and then right behind it we set up this space which be the tutoring center so right there be the tutoring center and then behind the curtain be the McSweeney office where all of we would be work on the magazine and book editing and thing like that the kid would come in or we think they would come in I should back up we set the place up we open up we spend month and month renovate this place we have table chair computer everything I go to a dot com auction at a Holiday Inn in Palo Alto and I buy 11 g4 with a stroke of a paddle anyway we buy em we set everything up and then we wait it be start with about 12 of my friend person that I have know for year that be writer in the neighborhood and we sit and at 2 30 p m we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk and it just say free tutoring for you English relate and write related need just come in it be all free and we think oh they be go to storm the gate they be go to love it and they do not and so we wait we sit at the table we wait and wait and everybody be become very discouraged because it be week and week that we wait really where nobody come in and then somebody alert we to the fact that maybe there be a trust gap because we be operate behind a pirate supply store laughter we never put it together you know and so then around that time I persuade a woman name Nineveh Caligari a longtime San Francisco educator she be teach in Mexico City she have all the experience necessary know everything about education be connect with all the teacher and community member in the neighborhood I convince she to move up from Mexico City where she be teach she take over as executive director immediately she make the inroad with the teacher and the parent and the student and everything and so suddenly it be actually full every day and what we be try to offer every day be one on one attention the goal be to have a one to one ratio with every one of this student you know it be be prove that 35 to 40 hour a year with one on one attention a student can get one grade level high and so most of this student English be not speak in the home they come there many time they parent you can not see it but there be a church pew that I buy in a Berkeley auction right there the parent will sometimes watch while they kid be be tutor so that be the basis of it be one on one attention and we find ourselves full every day with kid if you be on Valencia Street within that few block at around 2 p m 2 30 p m you will get run over often by the kid and they big backpack or whatever actually run to this space which be very strange because it be school in a way but there be something psychological happen there that be just a little bit different and the other thing be there be no stigma kid be not go into the Center for kid that need more help or something like that it be 826 Valencia First of all it be a pirate supply store which be insane and then secondly there be a publishing company in the back and so we intern be actually work at the same table very often and shoulder to shoulder computer next to computer with the student and so it become a tutoring center publishing center be what we call it and a writing center they go in and they might be work with a high school student actually work on a novel because we have very gifted kid too so there be no stigma they be all work next to each other it be all a creative endeavor they be see adult they be model they behavior this adult they be work in they field they can lean over ask a question of one of this adult and it all sort of feed on each other there be a lot of cross pollination the only problem especially for the adult work at McSweeney who have not necessarily buy into all of this when they sign up be that there be just the one bathroom laughter with like 60 kid a day this be a problem but you know there be something about the kid finish they homework in a give day work one on one get all this attention they go home they be finish they do not stall they do not do they homework in front of the tv they be allow to go home at 5 30 p m enjoy they family enjoy other hobby get outside play and that make a happy family a bunch of happy family in a neighborhood be a happy community a bunch of happy community tie together be a happy city and a happy world so the key to it all be homework laughter applause there you have it you know one on one attention so we start off with about 12 volunteer and then we have about 50 and then a couple hundred and we now have 1 400 volunteer on we roster and we make it incredibly easy to volunteer the key thing be even if you only have a couple of hour a month that two hour shoulder to shoulder next to one student concentrate attention shine this beam of light on they work on they think and they self expression be go to be absolutely transformative because so many of the student have not have that ever before so we say even if you have two hour one Sunday every six month it do not matter that be go to be enough so that be partly why the tutor corps grow so fast then we say well what be we go to do with the space during the day because it have to be use before 2 30 p m so we start bring in class during the day so every day there be a field trip where they together create a book you can see it be type up above this be one of the class get way too excited about write you just point a camera at a class and it always look like this so this be one of the book that they do notice the title of the book the Book that be never check out Titanic and the first line of that book be once there be a book name Cindy that be about the Titanic so meanwhile there be a adult in the back type this up take it completely seriously which blow they mind so then we still have more tutor to use this be a shot of just some of the tutor during one of the event the teacher that we work with and everything be different to teacher they tell we what to do we go in there think we be ultimately completely malleable you be go to tell we the neighborhood be go to tell we the parent be go to tell we the teacher be go to tell we how we be most useful so then they say why do not you come into the school because what about the student that would not come to you necessarily who do not have really active parent that be bring they in or be not close enough so then we start say well we have get 1 400 person on we tutor roster let just put out the word a teacher will say I need 12 tutor for the next five sunday we be work on we college essay send they in so we put that out on the wire 1 400 tutor whoever can make it sign up they go in about a half a hour before the class the teacher tell they what to do how to do it what they train be what they project be so far they work under the teacher guide and it be all in one big room and that be actually the brunt of what we do be person go straight from they workplace straight from home straight into the classroom and work directly with the student so then we be able to work with thousand and thousand of more student then another school say well what if we just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day so this be the Everett Middle School Writers room where we decorate it in buccaneer style it be right off the library and there we serve all 529 kid in this middle school this be they newspaper the straight Up News that have a ongoing column from Mayor Gavin Newsom in both language English and Spanish so then one day Isabel Allende write to we and say hey why do not you assign a book with high school student I want they to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world and so we go into Thurgood Marshall High School which be a school that we have work with on some other thing and we give that assignment to the student and we say Isabel Allende be go to read all you essay at the end she be go to publish they in a book she be go to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form it be go to be available in all the bookstore in the Bay Area and throughout the world on Amazon and you name it so this kid work hard than they have ever work on anything in they life because there be that outside audience there be Isabel Allende on the other end I think we have about 170 tutor that work on this book with they and so this work out incredibly well we have a big party at the end this be a book that you can find anywhere so that lead to a series of this you can see Amy Tan sponsor the next one I might get somewhere and this become a ongoing thing more and more book now we be sort of addict to the book thing the kid will work hard than they have ever work in they life if they know it be go to be permanent know it be go to be on a shelf know that nobody can diminish what they have think and say that we have honor they word honor they think with hundred of hour of five draft six draft all this attention that we give to they think and once they achieve that level once they have write at that level they can never go back it be absolutely transformative and so then they be all sell in the store this be near the plank we sell all the student book where else would you put they right so we sell em and then something weird have be happen with the store the store actually even though we start out as just a gag the store actually make money so it be pay the rent and maybe this be just a San Francisco thing I do not know I do not want to judge but person would come in and this be before the pirate movie and everything it be make a lot of money not a lot of money but it be pay the rent pay a full time staff member there there be the ocean map you can see on the left and it become a gateway to the community person would come in and say what the what be this I do not want to swear on the web laughter be that a rule I do not know they would say what be this and person would come in and learn more about it and then right beyond there be usually a little chain there right beyond they would see the kid be tutor this be a field trip go on and so they would be shop and they might be more likely to buy some lard or millet for they parrot or you know a hook or hook protector for nighttime all of this thing we sell so the store actually do really well but it bring in so many person teacher donor volunteer everybody because it be street level it be open to the public it be not a non profit bury you know on the 30th floor of some building downtown it be right in the neighborhood that it be serve and it be open all the time to the public so it become this sort of weird happy accident so all the person I use to know in Brooklyn they say well why do not we have a place like that here and a lot of they have be former educator or would be educator so they combine with a lot of local designer local writer and they just take the idea independently and they do they own thing they do not want to sell pirate supply they do not think that that be go to work there so know the crime fight community in New York they open the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company this be Sam Potts great design that do this and this be to make it look sort of like one of that keysmith shop that have to have every service they have ever offer you know all over there so they open this place inside it be like a Costco for superhero all the supply in kind of basic form this be all handmade this be all sort of repurpose other product or whatever all the packaging be do by Sam Potts so then you have the villain containment unit where kid put they parent you have the office this be a little vault you have to put you product in there it go up a electric lift and then the guy behind the counter tell you that you have to recite the vow of heroism which you do if you want to buy anything and it limit really they sale personally I think it be a problem because they have to do it hand on heart and everything this be some of the product this be all handmade this be a secret identity kit if you want to take on the identity of Sharon Boone one American female marketing executive from Hoboken New Jersey it be a full dossier on everything you would need to know about Sharon Boone so this be the capery where you get fit for you cape and then you walk up this three steel grade step and then we turn on three hydraulic fan from every side and then you can see the cape in action there be nothing bad than you know get up there and the cape be bunch up or something like that so then the secret door this be one of the shelf you do not see when you walk in but it slowly open you can see it there in the middle next to all the grapple hook it open and then this be the tutoring center in the back applause so you can see the full effect but this be I just want to emphasize locally fund locally build all the designer all of the builder everybody be local all the time be pro bono I just come and visit and say yes you guy be do great or whatever that be it you can see the time in all five borough of New York in the back laughter applause so this be the space during tutoring hour it be very busy same principle one on one attention complete devotion to the student work and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility of creativity and idea and this switch be flick in they head when they walk through that 18 foot of this bizarre store right so it be school but it be not school it be clearly not school even though they be work shoulder to shoulder on table pencil and paper whatever this be one of the student Khaled Hamdan you can read this quote addict to video game and tv could not concentrate at home come in get this concentrated attention and he could not escape it so soon enough he be write he would finish he homework early get really addicted to finish he homework early it be a addictive thing to sort of be do with it and to have it check and to know he be go to achieve the next thing and be prepare for school the next day so he get hook on that and then he start do other thing he be now be publish in five book he co write a mockumentary about fail superhero call Super have Beens he write a series on Penguin Balboa which be a fight a boxing penguin and then he read aloud just a few week ago to 500 person at Symphony Space at a benefit for 826 New York so he be there every day he be Evangelical about it he bring he cousin in now there be four family member that come in every day so I will go through really quickly this be l a the Echo Park Time Travel Mart whenever you be we be already then laughter this be sort of a 7 Eleven for time traveler so you see everything it be exactly as a 7 Eleven would be Leeches mammoth chunk they even have they own Slurpee machine out of Order come back yesterday laughter applause anyway so I be go to jump ahead this be space that be only affiliate with we do this same thing Word St in Pittsfield Massachusetts
