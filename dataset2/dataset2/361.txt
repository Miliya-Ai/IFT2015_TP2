this be a wheat bread a whole wheat bread and it be make with a new technique that I have be play around with and develop and write about which for lack of a good name we call the epoxy method and I call it a epoxy method because it be not very appetizing I understand that but but if you think about epoxy what be epoxy it be two resin that be sort of in and of themselves neither of which can make glue but when you put the two together something happen a bond take place and you get this very strong powerful adhesive well in this technique what I have try to do be kind of gather all of the knowledge that the bread baking world the artisan bread bake community have be try to accumulate over the last 20 year or so since we have be engage in a bread renaissance in America and put it together to come up with a method that would help to take whole grain bread and let face it everyone be try to move towards whole grain we finally after 40 year of know that wholegrain be a healthy option we be finally get to the point where we actually be tip over and attempt to actually eat they laughter the challenge though for a wholegrain baker be you know how do you make it taste good because whole grain it be easy with white flour to make a good taste bread White flour be sweet it be mainly starch and starch when you break it down what be starch it be thank you sugar yes so a baker and a good baker know how to pull or draw forth the inherent sugar trap in the starch with whole grain bread you have other obstacle you have get bran which be probably the healthy part of the bread for we or the fiber for we because it be just load with fiber for the bran be fiber it be get germ that be the good thing but that be not the tasty part of the wheat so whole grain bread historically have have sort of this onus of be health food bread and person do not like to eat quote health food they like to eat healthy and healthily but when we think of something as a health food we think of it as something we eat out of obligation not out of passion and love for the flavor and ultimately the challenge of the baker the challenge of every culinary student of every chef be to deliver flavor flavor be king flavor rule I call it the flavor rule flavor rule and and you can get somebody to eat something that be good for they once but they will not eat it again if they do not like it right so this be the challenge for this bread we be go to try this at lunch and I will explain a bit more about it but it be make not only with two type of pre dough this attempt again at bring out flavor be to make a piece of dough the day before that be not leaven it be just dough that be wet it be hydrated dough we call the soaker that help to start enzyme activity and enzyme be the secret kind of ingredient in dough that bring out flavor it start to release the sugar trap in the starch that be what enzyme be do and so if we can release some of that they become accessible to we in we palate they become accessible to the yeast as food they become accessible to the oven for caramelization to give we a beautiful crust the other pre dough that we make be ferment we pre ferment and it be make it can be a sourdough starter or what we call a biga or any other kind of pre ferment dough with a little yeast in it and that start to develop flavor also and on day two we put that two piece together that be the epoxy and we be hope that sort of the enzyme piece of dough become the fuel pack for the leaven piece of dough and when we put they together and add the final ingredient we can create a bread that do evoke the full potential of flavor trap in the grain that be the challenge okay so now what we in the journey of wheat let go back and look at this 12 stage I be go to go through they very quickly and then revisit they okay we be go to start with the first stage and this be what every student have to begin with everyone who work in the culinary world know that the first stage of cooking be mise en place which be just a French way of say get organize everything in its place first stage so in baking we call it scale weigh out the ingredient stage two be mix we take the ingredient and we mix they we have to develop the gluten there be no gluten in flour there be only the potential for gluten here be another kind of prefigure of epoxy because we have get glutenin and gliadin neither of which be strong enough to make a good bread but when they get hydrated and they bond to each other they create a strong molecule a strong protein we call gluten and so we in the mixing process have to develop the gluten we have to activate the leaven or the yeast and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredient evenly then we get into fermentation the third stage which be really where the flavor develop the yeast come alive and start eat the sugar create carbon dioxide and alcohol essentially it be burp and sweat which be what bread be it be yeast burp and sweat and somehow this be transform the yeast burp and sweat be later transform and this be really get to the heart of what make bread so special be that it be a transformational food and we be go to explore that in a minute but then quickly through the next few stage we after it be fermented and it be develop start to develop flavor and character we divide it into small unit and then we take that unit and we shape they we give they a little pre shape usually a round or a little torpedo shape sometimes that be call round and there be a short rest period it can be for a few second it can be for 20 or 30 minute we call that rest or bench then we go into final shaping pan which mean put the shape loaf on a pan this take a second but it be a distinctive stage it can be in a basket it can be in a loaf pan but we pan it and then stage nine the fermentation which start at stage three be continue through all this other stage again develop more flavor the final fermentation take place in stage nine we call it proof proofing mean to prove that the dough be alive and at stage nine we get the dough to the final shape and it go into the oven stage 10 three transformation take place in the oven the sugar in the dough caramelize in the crust they give we that beautiful brown crust only the crust can caramelize it be the only place that get hot enough inside the proteins this gluten coagulate when it get to about 160 degree the proteins all line up and they create structure the gluten structure what ultimately we will call the crumb of the bread and the starch when they reach about 180 degree gelatinize and gelatinization be yet another oven transformation coagulation caramelization and gelatinization when the starch be thick and they absorb all the moisture that be around they they they kind of swell and then they burst and they burst and they spill they gut into the bread so basically now we be eat yeast sweat sweat burp and starch gut again transform in stage 10 in the oven because what go into the oven as dough come out in stage 11 as bread and stage 11 we call it cool because we never really eat the bread right away there be a little carry over bake the proteins have to set up strengthen and firm up and then we have stage 12 which the textbook call packaging but my student call eat and so we be go to be on we own journey today from wheat to eat and in a few minute we will try this and see if we have succeed in fulfil this baker mission of pull out flavor but I want to go back now and revisit this step and talk about it from the standpoint of transformation because I really believe that all thing can be understand and this be not my own idea this go back to the Scholastics and to the Ancients that all thing can be understand on four level the literal the metaphoric or poetic level the political or ethical level and ultimately the mystical or sometimes call the anagogical level it be hard to get to that level unless you go through the literal in fact Dante say you can not understand the three deep level unless you first understand the literal level so that be why we be talk literally about bread but let kind of look at this stage again from the standpoint of connection to possibly a deep level all in my quest for answer the question what be it about bread that be so special and fulfil this mission of evoke the full potential of flavor because what happen be bread begin as wheat or any other grain but what be wheat wheat be a grass that grow in the field and like all grass at a certain point it put out seed and we harvest that seed and that be the wheat kernel now in order to harvest it I mean what be harvest it be just a euphemism for kill right I mean that be what be harvest we say we harvest the pig you know yes we slaughter you know yes that be life we harvest the wheat and in harvesting it we kill it now wheat be alive and as we harvest it it give up its seed now at least with seed we have the potential for future life we can plant that in the ground and we save some of that for the next generation but most of that seed get crush and turn into flour and at that point the wheat have suffer the ultimate indignity it be not only be kill but it be be deny any potential for create future life so we turn it into flour so as I say I think bread be a transformational food the first transformation and by the way the definition of transformation for I be a radical change from one thing into something else o k radical not subtle not like hot water make cold or cold water turn hot but water boil off and become steam that be a transformation two different thing well in this case the first transformation be alive to dead I would call that radical so we have get now this flour and what do we do we add some water in stage one we weigh it in stage two we add water and salt to it mix it together and we create something that we call clay it be like clay and we infuse that clay with a ingredient that we call leaven in this case it be yeast but yeast be leaven what do leaven mean leaven come from the root word that mean enliven to vivify to bring to life by the way what be the hebrew word for clay Adam you see the baker in this moment have become in a sense sort of the God of he dough you know and he dough well while it be not a intelligent life form be now alive and we know it be alive because in stage three it grow growth be the proof of life and while it be grow all this literal transformation be take place enzyme be break forth sugar yeast be eat sugar and turn it into carbon dioxide and alcohol bacterium be in there eat the same sugar turn they into acid in other word personality and character be develop in this dough under the watchful gaze of the baker and the baker choice all along the way determine the outcome of the product a subtle change in temperature a subtle change in time it be all about a balancing act between time temperature and ingredient that be the art of bake so all this thing be determine by the baker and the bread go through some stage and character develop and then we divide it and this one big piece of dough be divide into small unit and each of that unit be give shape by the baker and as they be shape they be raise again all along prove that they be alive and develop character and at stage 10 we take it to the oven it be still dough nobody eat bread dough a few person do I think but not too many I have meet some dough eater but it be not the staff of life right Bread be the staff of life but dough be what we be work with and we take that dough to the oven and it go into the oven as soon as the interior temperature of that dough cross the threshold of 140 degree it pass what we call the thermal death point student love that tdp they think it be the name of a video game but it be the thermal death point all life cease there the yeast whose mission it have be up till now to raise the dough to enliven it to vivify it in order to complete its mission which be also to turn this dough into bread have to give up its life so you see the symbolism at work it be start to come forth a little bit you know it be start to make sense to I what go in be dough what come out be bread or it go in alive come out dead third transformation first transformation alive to dead second transformation dead bring back to life third transformation alive to dead but dough to bread or another analogy would be a caterpillar have be turn into a butterfly and it be what come out of the oven that be what we call the staff of life this be the product that everyone in the world eat that be so difficult to give up it be so deeply embed in we psyche that bread be use as a symbol for life it be use as a symbol for transformation and so as we get to stage 12 and we partake of that again complete the life cycle you know we have a chance to essentially ingest that it nurture we and we continue to carry on and have opportunity to ponder thing like this so this be what I have learn from bread this be what bread have teach I in my journey and what we be go to attempt to do with this bread here again be to use in addition to everything we talk about this bread we be go to call spend grain bread because as you know bread making be very similar to beer make Beer be basically liquid bread or bread be solid beer and laughter they they be invent around the same time I think beer come first and the Egyptian who be tend the beer fall asleep in the hot Egyptian sun and it turn into bread but we have get this bread and what I do here be to try to again evoke even more flavor from this grain be we have add into it the spend grain from beer make and if you make this bread you can use any kind of spend grain from any type of beer I like dark spend grain today we be use a light spend grain that be actually from like some kind of a lager of some sort a light lager or a ale that be wheat and barley that be be toast in other word the beer maker know also how to evoke flavor from the grain by use sprout and malt and roast we be go to take some of that and put it into the bread so now we not only have a high fiber bread but now fiber on top of fiber and so this be again hopefully not only a healthy bread but a bread that you will enjoy so if I kind of break this bread maybe we can share this now a little bit here we will start a little piece here and I be go to take a little piece here I think I would well taste it myself before you have it at lunch I will leave you with what I call the baker blessing may you crust be crisp and you bread always rise thank you
