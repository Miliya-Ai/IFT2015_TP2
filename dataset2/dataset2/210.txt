I have give the slide show that I give here two year ago about 2 000 time I be give a short slide show this morning that I be give for the very first time so well it be I do not want or need to raise the bar I be actually try to lower the bar because I have cobble this together to try to meet the challenge of this session and I be remind by Karen Armstrong fantastic presentation that religion really properly understand be not about belief but about behavior perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism how dare we be optimistic optimism be sometimes characterize as a belief a intellectual posture as Mahatma Gandhi famously say you must become the change you wish to see in the world and the outcome about which we wish to be optimistic be not go to be create by the belief alone except to the extent that the belief bring about new behavior but the word behavior be also I think sometimes misunderstand in this context I be a big advocate of change the lightbulb and buy hybrid and Tipper and I put 33 solar panel on we house and dig the geothermal well and do all of that other stuff but as important as it be to change the lightbulb it be more important to change the law and when we change we behavior in we daily life we sometimes leave out the citizenship part and the democracy part in order to be optimistic about this we have to become incredibly active as citizen in we democracy in order to solve the climate crisis we have to solve the democracy crisis and we have one I have be try to tell this story for a long time I be remind of that recently by a woman who walk past the table I be sit at just stare at I as she walk past she be in she 70 look like she have a kind face I think nothing of it until I see from the corner of my eye she be walk from the opposite direction also just stare at I and so I say how do you do and she say you know if you dye you hair black you would look just like Al Gore laughter many year ago when I be a young congressman I spend a awful lot of time deal with the challenge of nuclear arm control the nuclear arm race and the military historian teach I during that quest that military conflict be typically put into three category local battle regional or theater war and the rare but all important global world war strategic conflict and each level of conflict require a different allocation of resource a different approach a different organizational model environmental challenge fall into the same three category and most of what we think about be local environmental problem air pollution water pollution hazardous waste dump but there be also regional environmental problem like acid rain from the Midwest to the Northeast and from Western Europe to the Arctic and from the Midwest out the Mississippi into the dead zone of the Gulf of Mexico and there be lot of that but the climate crisis be the rare but all important global or strategic conflict everything be affect and we have to organize we response appropriately we need a worldwide global mobilization for renewable energy conservation efficiency and a global transition to a low carbon economy we have work to do and we can mobilize resource and political will but the political will have to be mobilize in order to mobilize the resource let I show you this slide here I think I would start with the logo what be miss here of course be the North Polar ice cap Greenland remain twenty eight year ago this be what the polar ice cap the North Polar ice cap look like at the end of the summer at the fall equinox this last fall I go to the Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder Colorado and talk to the researcher here in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory this be what be happen in the last 28 year to put it in perspective 2005 be the previous record here be what happen last fall that have really unnerved the researcher the North Polar ice cap be the same size geographically do not look quite the same size but it be exactly the same size as the United States minus a area roughly equal to the state of Arizona the amount that disappear in 2005 be equivalent to everything east of the Mississippi the extra amount that disappear last fall be equivalent to this much it come back in the winter but not as permanent ice as thin ice vulnerable the amount remain could be completely go in summer in as little as five year that put a lot of pressure on Greenland already around the Arctic Circle this be a famous village in Alaska this be a town in Newfoundland Antarctica late study from NASA the amount of a moderate to severe snow melting of a area equivalent to the size of California they be the good of time they be the bad of time the most famous opening sentence in English literature I want to share briefly a tale of two planet Earth and Venus be exactly the same size Earth diameter be about 400 kilometer large but essentially the same size they have exactly the same amount of carbon but the difference be on Earth most of the carbon have be leech over time out of the atmosphere deposit in the ground as coal oil natural gas etc on Venus most of it be in the atmosphere the difference be that we temperature be 59 degree on average on Venus it be 855 this be relevant to we current strategy of take as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible and put it into the atmosphere it be not because Venus be slightly close to the Sun it be three time hot than Mercury which be right next to the Sun now briefly here be a image you have see as one of the only old image but I show it because I want to briefly give you CSI Climate the global scientific community say man make global warming pollution put into the atmosphere thickening this be trap more of the outgoing infrared you all know that at the last IPCC summary the scientist want to say how certain be you they want to answer that 99 percent the Chinese object and so the compromise be more than 90 percent now the skeptic say oh wait a minute this could be variation in this energy come in from the sun if that be true the stratosphere would be heat as well as the low atmosphere if it be more come in if it be more be trap on the way out then you would expect it to be warm here and cool here here be the low atmosphere here be the stratosphere cool csi climate now here be the good news sixty eight percent of American now believe that human activity be responsible for global warming sixty nine percent believe that the Earth be heat up in a significant way there have be progress but here be the key when give a list of challenge to confront global warming be still list at near the bottom what be miss be a sense of urgency if you agree with the factual analysis but you do not feel the sense of urgency where do that leave you well the Alliance for Climate Protection which I head in conjunction with current tv who do this pro bono do a worldwide contest to do commercial on how to communicate this this be the winner NBC I will show all of the network here the top journalist for NBC ask 956 question in 2007 of the presidential candidate two of they be about the climate crisis ABC 844 question two about the climate crisis Fox two CNN two CBS zero from laugh to tear this be one of the old tobacco commercial so here be what we be do this be gasoline consumption in all of this country and we but it be not just the developed nation the develop country be now follow we and accelerate they pace and actually they cumulative emission this year be the equivalent to where we be in 1965 and they be catch up very dramatically the total concentration by 2025 they will be essentially where we be in 1985 if the wealthy country be completely miss from the picture we would still have this crisis but we have give to the develop country the technology and the way of think that be create the crisis this be in Bolivia over thirty year this be peak fishing in a few second the 60 70 80 90 we have to stop this and the good news be that we can we have the technology we have to have a unified view of how to go about this the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cut wealthy country emission all have a single very simple solution person say what be the solution here it be put a price on carbon we need a co2 tax revenue neutral to replace taxation on employment which be invent by Bismarck and some thing have change since the 19th century in the poor world we have to integrate the response to poverty with the solution to the climate crisis plan to fight poverty in Uganda be moot if we do not solve the climate crisis but response can actually make a huge difference in the poor country this be a proposal that have be talk about a lot in Europe this be from Nature magazine this be concentrate solar renewable energy plant link in a so call supergrid to supply all of the electrical power to Europe largely from develop country high voltage DC current this be not pie in the sky this can be do we need to do it for we own economy the late figure show that the old model be not work there be a lot of great investment that you can make if you be invest in tar sand or shale oil then you have a portfolio that be cram with sub prime carbon asset and it be base on a old model junkie find vein in they toe when the one in they arm and they leg collapse develop tar sand and coal shale be the equivalent here be just a few of the investment that I personally think make sense I have a stake in this so I will have a disclaimer there but geothermal concentrate solar advanced photovoltaic efficiency and conservation you have see this slide before but there be a change the only two country that do not ratify and now there be only one Australia have a election and there be a campaign in Australia that involve television and internet and radio commercial to lift the sense of urgency for the person there and we train 250 person to give the slide show in every town and village and city in Australia Lot of other thing contribute to it but the new Prime Minister announce that he very first priority would be to change Australia position on Kyoto and he have now they come to a awareness partly because of the horrible drought that they have have this be Lake Lanier my friend Heidi Cullen say that if we give drought name the way we give hurricane name we would call the one in the southeast now Katrina and we would say it be head toward Atlanta we can not wait for the kind of drought Australia have to change we political culture here be more good news the city support Kyoto in the U S be up to 780 and I think I see one go by there just to localize this which be good news now to close we hear a couple of day ago about the value of make individual heroism so commonplace that it become banal or routine what we need be another hero generation that of we who be alive in the United States of America today especially but also the rest of the world have to somehow understand that history have present we with a choice just as Jill Bolte Taylor be figure out how to save she life while she be distract by the amazing experience that she be go through we now have a culture of distraction but we have a planetary emergency and we have to find a way to create in the generation of that alive today a sense of generational mission I wish I could find the word to convey this this be another hero generation that bring democracy to the planet another that end slavery and that give woman the right to vote we can do this do not tell I that we do not have the capacity to do it if we have just one week worth of what we spend on the Iraq War we could be well on the way to solve this challenge we have the capacity to do it one final point I be optimistic because I believe we have the capacity at moment of great challenge to set aside the cause of distraction and rise to the challenge that history be present to we sometimes I hear person respond to the disturbing fact of the climate crisis by say oh this be so terrible what a burden we have I would like to ask you to reframe that how many generation in all of human history have have the opportunity to rise to a challenge that be worthy of we good effort a challenge that can pull from we more than we know we could do I think we ought to approach this challenge with a sense of profound joy and gratitude that we be the generation about which a thousand year from now philharmonic orchestra and poet and singer will celebrate by say they be the one that find it within themselves to solve this crisis and lay the basis for a bright and optimistic human future let do that thank you very much Chris Anderson for so many person at TED there be deep pain that basically a design issue on a voting form one bad design issue mean that you voice be not be hear like that in the last eight year in a position where you could make this thing come true that hurt Al Gore you have no idea laughter can when you look at what the lead candidate in you own party be do now I mean there be be you excite by they plan on global warming AG the answer to the question be hard for I because on the one hand I think that we should feel really great about the fact that the Republican nominee certain nominee John McCain and both of the finalist for the democratic nomination all three have a very different and forward leaning position on the climate crisis all three have offer leadership and all three be very different from the approach take by the current administration and I think that all three have also be responsible in put forward plan and proposal but the campaign dialogue that as illustrate by the question that be put together by the League of Conservation voter by the way the analysis of all the question and by the way the debate have all be sponsor by something that go by the Orwellian label clean coal have anybody notice that every single debate have be sponsor by clean coal now even low emission the richness and fullness of the dialogue in we democracy have not lay the basis for the kind of bold initiative that be really need so they be say the right thing and they may whichever of they be elect may do the right thing but let I tell you when I come back from Kyoto in 1997 with a feeling of great happiness that we have get that breakthrough there and then confront the United States Senate only one out of 100 senator be willing to vote to confirm to ratify that treaty whatever the candidate say have to be lay alongside what the person say this challenge be part of the fabric of we whole civilization co2 be the exhale breath of we civilization literally and now we mechanized that process change that pattern require a scope a scale a speed of change that be beyond what we have do in the past so that be why I begin by say be optimistic in what you do but be a active citizen demand change the light bulb but change the law change the global treaty we have to speak up we have to solve this democracy this we have sclerosis in we democracy and we have to change that use the internet go on the internet connect with person become very active as citizen have a moratorium we should not have any new coal fire generate plant that be not able to capture and store co2 which mean we have to quickly build this renewable source now nobody be talk on that scale but I do believe that between now and November it be possible this Alliance for Climate Protection be go to launch a nationwide campaign grassroots mobilization television ad internet ad radio newspaper with partnership with everybody from the girl scout to the hunter and fisherman we need help we need help ca in term of you own personal role go forward Al be there something more than that you would like to be do AG I have pray that I would be able to find the answer to that question what can I do Buckminster Fuller once write if the future of all human civilization depend on I what would I do how would I be it do depend on all of we but again not just with the light bulb we most of we here be American we have a democracy we can change thing but we have to actively change what be need really be a high level of consciousness and that be hard to that be hard to create but it be come there be a old African proverb that some of you know that say if you want to go quickly go alone if you want to go far go together we have to go far quickly so we have to have a change in consciousness a change in commitment a new sense of urgency a new appreciation for the privilege that we have of undertake this challenge CA Al Gore thank you so much for come to TED AG thank you thank you very much
