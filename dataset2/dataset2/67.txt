well I think there would be a podium so I be a bit scared laughter Chris ask I to tell again how we find the structure of dna and since you know I follow he order I will do it but it slightly bore I laughter and you know I write a book so I will say something laughter I will say a little about you know how the discovery be make and why Francis and I find it and then I hope maybe I have at least five minute to say what make I tick now in back of I be a picture of I when I be 17 I be at the University of Chicago in my third year and I be in my third year because the University of Chicago let you in after two year of high school so you it be fun to get away from high school laughter because I be very small and I be no good in sport or anything like that but I should say that my background my father be you know raise to be a Episcopalian and Republican but after one year of college he become a atheist and a Democrat laughter and my mother be Irish catholic and but she do not take religion too seriously and by the age of 11 I be no long go to Sunday Mass and go on birdwatch walk with my father so early on I hear of Charles Darwin I guess you know he be the big hero and you know you understand life as it now exist through evolution and at the University of Chicago I be a zoology major and think I would end up you know if I be bright enough maybe get a ph d from Cornell in ornithology then in the Chicago paper there be a review of a book call what be Life by the great physicist Schrodinger and that of course have be a question I want to know you know Darwin explain life after it get start but what be the essence of life and Schrodinger say the essence be information present in we chromosome and it have to be present on a molecule I would never really think of molecule before you know chromosome but this be a molecule and somehow all the information be probably present in some digital form and there be the big question of how do you copy the information so that be the book and so from that moment on I want to be a geneticist understand the gene and through that understand life so I have you know a hero at a distance it be not a baseball player it be Linus Pauling and so I apply to Caltech and they turn I down laughter so I go to Indiana which be actually as good as Caltech in genetics and besides they have a really good basketball team laughter so I have a really quite happy life at Indiana and it be at Indiana I get the impression that you know the gene be likely to be dna and so when I get my ph d I should go and search for dna so I first go to Copenhagen because I think well maybe I could become a biochemist but I discover biochemistry be very boring it be not go anywhere toward you know say what the gene be it be just nuclear science and oh that be the book little book you can read it in about two hour and but then I go to a meeting in Italy and there be a unexpected speaker who be not on the program and he talk about dna and this be Maurice Wilkins he be train as a physicist and after the war he want to do biophysic and he pick dna because dna have be determine at the Rockefeller Institute to possibly be the genetic molecule on the chromosome most person believe it be proteins but Wilkins you know thought dna be the good bet and he show this x ray photograph sort of crystalline so dna have a structure even though it owe it to probably different molecule carry different set of instruction so there be something universal about the dna molecule so I want to work with he but he do not want a former birdwatcher and I end up in Cambridge England so I go to Cambridge because it be really the good place in the world then for x ray crystallography and x ray crystallography be now a subject in you know chemistry department I mean in that day it be the domain of the physicist so the good place for x ray crystallography be at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge and there I meet Francis Crick I go there without know he he be 35 I be 23 and within a day we have decide that maybe we could take a shortcut to find the structure of dna not solve it like you know in rigorous fashion but build a model a electro model use some coordinate of you know length all that sort of stuff from x ray photograph but just ask what the molecule how should it fold up and the reason for do so at the center of this photograph be Linus Pauling about six month before he propose the alpha helical structure for proteins and in do so he banish the man out on the right Sir Lawrence Bragg who be the Cavendish professor this be a photograph several year later when Bragg have cause to smile he certainly be not smile when I get there because he be somewhat humiliate by paul get the alpha helix and the Cambridge person fail because they be not chemist and certainly neither Crick or I be chemist so we try to build a model and he know Francis know Wilkins so Wilkins say he think it be the helix x ray diagram he think be comparable with the helix so we build a three strand model the person from London come up Wilkins and this collaborator or possible collaborator Rosalind Franklin come up and sort of laugh at we model they say it be lousy and it be so we be tell to build no more model we be incompetent laughter and so we do not build any model and Francis sort of continue to work on proteins and basically I do nothing and except read you know basically read be a good thing you get fact and we keep tell the person in London that Linus Pauling be go to move on to dna if dna be that important Linus will know it he will build a model and then we be go to be scoop and in fact he have write the person in London could he see they x ray photograph and they have the wisdom to say no so he do not have it but there be one in the literature actually Linus do not look at they that carefully but about oh 15 month after I get to Cambridge a rumor begin to appear from Linus Pauling son who be in Cambridge that he father be now work on dna and so one day Peter come in and he say he be Peter Pauling and he give I a copy of he father manuscript and boy I be scared because I think you know we may be scoop I have nothing to do no qualification for anything laughter and so there be the paper and he propose a three strand structure and I read it and it be just it be crap laughter so this be you know unexpected from the world laughter and so it be hold together by hydrogen bond between phosphate group well if the peak ph that cell have be around seven that hydrogen bond could not exist we rush over to the chemistry department and say could Pauling be right and Alex Hust say no so we be happy laughter and you know we be still in the game but we be frightened that somebody at Caltech would tell Linus that he be wrong and so Bragg say build model and a month after we get the Pauling manuscript I should say I take the manuscript to London and show the person well I say Linus be wrong and that we be still in the game and that they should immediately start build model but Wilkins say no Rosalind Franklin be leave in about two month and after she leave he would start build model and so I come back with that news to Cambridge and Bragg say build model well of course I want to build model and there be a picture of Rosalind she really you know in one sense she be a chemist but really she would have be train she do not know any organic chemistry or quantum chemistry she be a crystallographer and I think part of the reason she do not want to build model be she be not a chemist whereas Pauling be a chemist and so Crick and I you know start build model and I would learn a little chemistry but not enough well we get the answer on the 28th February 53 and it be because of a rule which to I be a very good rule never be the bright person in a room and we be not we be not the good chemist in the room I go in and show they a pair I would do and Jerry Donohue he be a chemist he say it be wrong you have get the hydrogen atom be in the wrong place I just put they down like they be in the book he say they be wrong so the next day you know after I think well he might be right so I change the location and then we find the base pair and Francis immediately say the chain run in absolute direction and we know we be right so it be a pretty you know it all happen in about two hour from nothing to thing and we know it be big because you know if you just put a next to t and g next to c you have a copying mechanism so we see how genetic information be carry it be the order of the four basis so in a sense it be a sort of digital type information and you copy it by go from strand separate so you know if it do not work this way you might as well believe it because you do not have any other scheme laughter but that be not the way most scientist think most scientist be really rather dull they say we will not think about it until we know it be right but you know we think well it be at least 95 percent right or 99 percent right so think about it the next five year there be essentially something like five reference to we work in Nature none and so we be leave by ourselves and try to do the last part of the trio how do you what do this genetic information do it be pretty obvious that it provide the information to a rna molecule and then how do you go from rna to protein for about three year we just I try to solve the structure of rna it do not yield it do not give good x ray photograph I be decidedly unhappy a girl do not marry I it be really you know sort of a shitty time laughter so there be a picture of Francis and I before I meet the girl so I be still look happy laughter but there be what we do when we do not know where to go forward we form a club and call it the rna Tie Club George Gamow also a great physicist he design the tie he be one of the member the question be how do you go from a four letter code to the 20 letter code of proteins Feynman be a member and Teller and friend of Gamow but that be the only no we be only photograph twice and on both occasion you know one of we be miss the tie there be Francis up on the upper right and Alex Rich the m d turn crystallographer be next to I this be take in Cambridge in September of 1955 and I be smile sort of force I think because the girl I have boy she be go laughter and so I do not really get happy until 1960 because then we find out basically you know that there be three form of rna and we know basically dna provide the information for rna rna provide the information for protein and that let Marshall Nirenberg you know take rna synthetic rna put it in a system make protein he make polyphenylalanine polyphenylalanine so that be the first crack of the genetic code and it be all over by 1966 so there that be what Chris want I to do it be so what happen since then well at that time I should go back when we find the structure of dna I give my first talk at Cold Spring Harbor the physicist Leo Szilard he look at I and say be you go to patent this and but he know patent law and that we could not patent it because you could not no use for it laughter and so dna do not become a useful molecule and the lawyer do not enter into the equation until 1973 20 year later when Boyer and Cohen in San Francisco and Stanford come up with they method of recombinant dna and Stanford patent it and make a lot of money at least they patent something which you know could do useful thing and then they learn how to read the letter for the code and boom we have you know have a biotech industry and but we be still a long way from you know answer a question which sort of dominate my childhood which be how do you nature nurture and so I will go on I be already out of time but this be Michael Wigler a very very clever mathematician turn physicist and he develop a technique which essentially will let we look at sample dna and eventually a million spot along it there be a chip there a conventional one then there be one make by a photolithography by a company in Madison call NimbleGen which be way ahead of Affymetrix and we use they technique and what you can do be sort of compare dna of normal seg versus cancer and you can see on the top that cancer which be bad show insertion or deletion so the dna be really badly muck up whereas if you have a chance of survive the dna be not so muck up so we think that this will eventually lead to what we call dna biopsy before you get treat for cancer you should really look at this technique and get a feeling of the face of the enemy it be not a it be only a partial look but it be a I think it be go to be very very useful so we start with breast cancer because there be lot of money for it no government money and now I have a sort of vested interest I want to do it for prostate cancer so you know you be not treat if it be not dangerous but Wigler besides look at cancer cell look at normal cell and make a really sort of surprising observation which be all of we have about 10 place in we genome where we have lose a gene or gain another one so we be sort of all imperfect and the question be well if we be around here you know this little loss or gain might not be too bad but if this deletion or amplification occur in the wrong gene maybe we will feel sick so the first disease he look at be autism and the reason we look at autism be we have the money to do it look at a individual be about 3 000 dollar and the parent of a child with Asperger disease the high intelligence autism have send he thing to a conventional company they do not do it could not do it by conventional genetics but just scan it we begin to find gene for autism and you can see here there be a lot of they so a lot of autistic kid be autistic because they just lose a big piece of dna I mean big piece at the molecular level we see one autistic kid about five million basis just miss from one of he chromosome we have not yet look at the parent but the parent probably do not have that loss or they would not be parent now so we autism study be just begin we get three million dollar I think it will cost at least 10 to 20 before you would be in a position to help parent who have have a autistic child or think they may have a autistic child and can we spot the difference so this same technique should probably look at all it be a wonderful way to find gene and so I will conclude by say we have look at 20 person with schizophrenia and we think we have probably have to look at several hundred before we get the picture but as you can see there be seven out of 20 have a change which be very high and yet in the control there be three so what be the meaning of the control be they crazy also and we do not know it or you know be they normal I would guess they be normal and what we think in schizophrenia be there be gene of predisposure and whether this be one that predispose and then there be only a sub segment of the population that be capable of be schizophrenic now we do not have really any evidence of it but I think to give you a hypothesis the good guess be that if you be left hand you be prone to schizophrenia 30 percent of schizophrenic person be leave handed and schizophrenia have a very funny genetics which mean 60 percent of the person be genetically leave handed but only half of it show I do not have the time to say now some person who think they be right hand be genetically leave handed ok I be just say that if you think oh I do not carry a left handed gene so therefore my you know child will not be at risk of schizophrenia you might ok laughter so it be to I a extraordinarily exciting time we ought to be able to find the gene for bipolar there be a relationship and if I have enough money we have find they all this year I thank you
