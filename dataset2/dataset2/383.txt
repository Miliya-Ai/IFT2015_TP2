so my question be we alone the story of human be the story of idea scientific idea that shine light into dark corner idea that we embrace rationally and irrationally idea for which we have live and die and kill and be kill idea that have vanish in history and idea that have be set in dogma it be a story of nation of ideology of territory and of conflict among they but every moment of human history from the Stone Age to the Information Age from Sumer and Babylon to the ipod and celebrity gossip they have all be carry out every book that you have read every poem every laugh every tear they have all happen here here here here laughter perspective be a very powerful thing perspective can change perspective can be alter from my perspective we live on a fragile island of life in a universe of possibility for many millennium human have be on a journey to find answer answer to question about naturalism and transcendence about who we be and why we be and of course who else might be out there be it really just we be we alone in this vast universe of energy and matter and chemistry and physics well if we be it be a awful waste of space laughter but what if we be not what if out there other be ask and answer similar question what if they look up at the night sky at the same star but from the opposite side would the discovery of a old cultural civilization out there inspire we to find way to survive we increasingly uncertain technological adolescence might it be the discovery of a distant civilization and we common cosmic origin that finally drive home the message of the bond among all human whether we be bear in San Francisco or Sudan or close to the heart of the Milky Way galaxy we be the product of a billion year lineage of wander stardust we all of we be what happen when a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium evolve for so long that it begin to ask where it come from fifty year ago the journey to find answer take a different path and seti the search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence begin so what exactly be SETI Well SETI use the tool of astronomy to try and find evidence of someone else technology out there we own technology be visible over interstellar distance and theirs might be as well it might be that some massive network of communication or some shield against asteroidal impact or some huge astro engineering project that we can not even begin to conceive of could generate signal at radio or optical frequency that a determined program of search might detect for millennia we have actually turn to the priest and the philosopher for guidance and instruction on this question of whether there be intelligent life out there now we can use the tool of the 21st century to try and observe what be rather than ask what should be believe SETI do not presume the existence of extra terrestrial intelligence it merely note the possibility if not the probability in this vast universe which seem fairly uniform the number suggest a universe of possibility we sun be one of 400 billion star in we galaxy and we know that many other star have planetary system we have discover over 350 in the last 14 year include the small planet announce early this week which have a radius just twice the size of the Earth and if even all of the planetary system in we galaxy be devoid of life there be still 100 billion other galaxy out there altogether 10 22 star now I be go to try a trick and recreate a experiment from this morning remember one billion but this time not one billion dollar one billion star alright one billion star now up there 20 foot above the stage that be 10 trillion well what about 10 22 where be the line that mark that that line would have to be 3 8 million mile above this stage laughter 16 time far away than the moon or four percent of the distance to the sun so there be many possibility laughter and much of this vast universe much more may be habitable than we once think as we study extremophile on Earth organism that can live in condition totally inhospitable for we in the hot high pressure thermal vent at the bottom of the ocean freeze in ice in boil battery acid in the cool water of nuclear reactor this extremophile tell we that life may exist in many other environment but that environment be go to be widely space in this universe even we near star the Sun its emission suffer the tyranny of light speed it take a full eight minute for its radiation to reach we and the near star be 4 2 light year away which mean its light take 4 2 year to get here and the edge of we galaxy be 75 000 light year away and the near galaxy to we 2 5 million light year that mean any signal we detect would have start its journey a long time ago and a signal would give we a glimpse of they past not they present which be why Phil Morrison call SETI the archaeology of the future it tell we about they past but detection of a signal tell we it be possible for we to have a long future I think this be what David Deutsch mean in 2005 when he end he Oxford TEDTalk by say he have two principle he would like to share for live and he would like to carve they on stone tablet the first be that problem be inevitable the second be that problem be soluble so ultimately what be go to determine the success or failure of seti be the longevity of technology and the mean distance between technology in the cosmos distance over space and distance over time if technology do not last and persist we will not succeed and we be a very young technology in a old galaxy and we do not yet know whether it be possible for technology to persist so up until now I have be talk to you about really large number let I talk about a relatively small number and that be the length of time that the Earth be lifeless zircon that be mine in the Jack Hills of western Australia zircon take from the Jack Hills of western Australia tell we that within a few hundred million year of the origin of the planet there be abundant water and perhaps even life so we planet have spend the vast majority of its 4 56 billion year history develop life not anticipate its emergence life happen very quickly and that bode well for the potential of life elsewhere in the cosmos and the other thing that one should take away from this chart be the very narrow range of time over which human can claim to be the dominant intelligence on the planet it be only the last few hundred thousand year modern human have be pursue technology and civilization so one need a very deep appreciation of the diversity and incredible scale of life on this planet as the first step in prepare to make contact with life elsewhere in the cosmos we be not the pinnacle of evolution we be not the determined product of billion of year of evolutionary plot and plan we be one outcome of a continue adaptational process we be resident of one small planet in a corner of the Milky Way galaxy and Homo sapiens be one small leaf on a very extensive tree of life which be densely populate by organism that have be hone for survival over million of year we misuse language and talk about the ascent of man we understand the scientific basis for the interrelatedness of life but we ego have not catch up yet so this ascent of man pinnacle of evolution have get to go it be a sense of privilege that the natural universe do not share Loren Eiseley have say one do not meet oneself until one catch the reflection from a eye other than human one day that eye may be that of a intelligent alien and the soon we eschew we narrow view of evolution the soon we can truly explore we ultimate origin and destination we be a small part of the story of cosmic evolution and we be go to be responsible for we continue participation in that story and perhaps SETI will help as well occasionally throughout history this concept of this very large cosmic perspective come to the surface and as a result we see transformative and profound discovery so in 1543 Nicholas Copernicus publish the Revolutions of Heavenly Spheres and by take the Earth out of the center and put the sun in the center of the solar system he open we eye to a much large universe of which we be just a small part and that Copernican revolution continue today to influence science and philosophy and technology and theology so in 1959 Giuseppe Coccone and Philip Morrison publish the first seti article in a refereed journal and bring seti into the scientific mainstream and in 1960 Frank Drake conduct the first SETI observation look at two star tau ceti and Epsilon Eridani for about 150 hour now Drake do not discover extraterrestrial intelligence but he learn a very valuable lesson from a passing aircraft and that be that terrestrial technology can interfere with the search for extraterrestrial technology we have be search ever since but it be impossible to overstate the magnitude of the search that remain all of the concerted seti effort over the last 40 some year be equivalent to scoop a single glass of water from the ocean and no one would decide that the ocean be without fish on the basis of one glass of water the 21st century now allow we to build big glass much big glass in Northern California we be begin to take observation with the first 42 telescope of the Allen Telescope array and I have get to take a moment right now to publicly thank Paul Allen and Nathan Myhrvold and all the teamseti member in the TED community who have so generously support this research applause the ata be the first telescope build from a large number of small dish and hook together with computer it be make silicon as important as aluminum and we will grow it in the future by add more antenna to reach 350 for more sensitivity and leverage Moore law for more processing capability today we signal detection algorithm can find very simple artifact and noise if you look very hard here you can see the signal from the Voyager 1 spacecraft the most distant human object in the universe 106 time as far away from we as the sun be and over that long distance its signal be very faint when it reach we it may be hard for you eye to see it but it be easily find with we efficient algorithm but this be a simple signal and tomorrow we want to be able to find more complex signal this be a very good year 2009 be the 400th anniversary of Galileo first use of the telescope Darwin 200th birthday the 150th anniversary of the publication of on the origin of Species the 50th anniversary of SETI as a science the 25th anniversary of the incorporation of the SETI Institute as a non profit and of course the 25th anniversary of TED and next month the Kepler Spacecraft will launch and will begin to tell we just how frequent earth like planet be the target for SETI search in 2009 the u n have declare it to be the International Year of Astronomy a global festival to help we resident of Earth rediscover we cosmic origin and we place in the universe and in 2009 change have come to Washington with a promise to put science in its rightful position applause so what would change everything well this be the question the Edge foundation ask this year and four of the respondent say seti why well to quote the discovery of intelligent life beyond Earth would eradicate the loneliness and solipsism that have plague we species since its inception and it would not simply change everything it would change everything all at once so if that be right why do we only capture four out of that 151 mind I think it be a problem of completion and delivery because the fine print say what game change idea and scientific development would you expect to live to see so we have a fulfillment problem we need big glass and more hand in the water and then work together maybe we can all live to see the detection of the first extraterrestrial signal that bring I to my wish I wish that you would empower earthle everywhere to become active participant in the ultimate search for cosmic company the first step would be to tap into the global brain trust to build a environment where raw datum could be store and where it could be access and manipulate where new algorithm could be develop and old algorithm make more efficient and this be a technically creative challenge and it would change the perspective of person who work on it and then we would like to augment the automate search with human insight we would like to use the pattern recognition capability of the human eye to find faint complex signal that we current algorithm miss and of course we would like to inspire and engage the next generation we would like to take the material that we have build for education and get they out to student everywhere student that can not come and visit we at the ata we would like to tell we story good and engage young person and thereby change they perspective I be sorry Seth Godin but over the millennia we have see where tribalism lead we have see what happen when we divide a already small planet into small island and ultimately we actually all belong to only one tribe to earthling and seti be a mirror a mirror that can show we ourselves from a extraordinary perspective and can help to trivialize the difference among we if SETI do nothing but change the perspective of human on this planet then it will be one of the most profound endeavor in history so in the opening day of 2009 a visionary president stand on the step of the U S Capitol and say we can not help but believe that the old hatred shall someday pass that the line of tribe shall soon dissolve that as the world grow small we common humanity shall reveal itself so I look forward to work with the TED community to hear about you idea about how to fulfill this wish and in collaborate with you hasten the day that that visionary statement can become a reality thank you applause
