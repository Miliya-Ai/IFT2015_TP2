so I be go to speak about a problem that I have and that be that I be a philosopher laughter when I go to a party and person ask I what do I do and I say I be a professor they eye glaze over when I go to a academic cocktail party and there be all the professor around they ask I what field I be in and I say philosophy they eye glaze over laughter when I go to a philosopher party laughter and they ask I what I work on and I say consciousness they eye do not glaze over they lip curl into a snarl laughter and I get hoot of derision and cackle and growl because they think that be impossible you can not explain consciousness the very chutzpah of somebody think that you could explain consciousness be just out of the question my late lament friend Bob Nozick a fine philosopher in one of he book philosophical explanation be comment on the ethos of philosophy the way philosopher go about they business and he say you know philosopher love rational argument and he say it seem as if the ideal argument for most philosopher be you give you audience the premise and then you give they the inference and the conclusion and if they do not accept the conclusion they die they head explode the idea be to have a argument that be so powerful that it knock out you opponent but in fact that do not change person mind at all it be very hard to change person mind about something like consciousness and I finally figure out the reason for that the reason for that be that everybody be a expert on consciousness we hear the other day that everybody be get a strong opinion about video game they all have a idea for a video game even if they be not expert but they do not consider themselves expert on video game they have just get strong opinion I be sure that person here who work on say climate change and global warming or on the future of the internet encounter person who have very strong opinion about what be go to happen next but they probably do not think of this opinion as expertise they be just strongly hold opinion but with regard to consciousness person seem to think each of we seem to think I be a expert simply by be conscious I know all about this and so you tell they you theory and they say no no that be not the way consciousness be no you have get it all wrong and they say this with a amazing confidence and so what I be go to try to do today be to shake you confidence because I know the feeling I can feel it myself I want to shake you confidence that you know you own innermost mind that you be yourselve authoritative about you own consciousness that be the order of the day here now this nice picture show a think balloon a thought bubble I think everybody understand what that mean that be suppose to exhibit the stream of consciousness this be my favorite picture of consciousness that be ever be do it be a Saul Steinberg of course it be a New Yorker cover and this fellow here be look at the painting by Braque that remind he of the word baroque barrack bark poodle Suzanne R he be off to the race there be a wonderful stream of consciousness here and if you follow it along you learn a lot about this man what I particularly like about this picture too be that Steinberg have render the guy in this sort of pointillist style which remind we as Rod Brooks be say yesterday what we be what each of we be what you be what I be be approximately 100 trillion little cellular robot that be what we be make of no other ingredient at all we be just make of cell about 100 trillion of they not a single one of that cell be conscious not a single one of that cell know who you be or care somehow we have to explain how when you put together team army battalion of hundred of million of little robotic unconscious cell not so different really from a bacterium each one of they the result be this I mean just look at it the content there be color there be idea there be memory there history and somehow all that content of consciousness be accomplish by the busy activity of that hoard of neuron how be that possible many person just think it be not possible at all they think no there can not be any sort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness this be a lovely book by a friend of mine name Lee Siegel who be a professor of religion actually at the University of Hawaii and he be a expert magician and a expert on the street magic of India which be what this book be about net of Magic and there be a passage in it which I would love to share with you it speak so eloquently to the problem I be write a book on magic I explain and I be ask real magic by real magic person mean miracle thaumaturgical act and supernatural power no I answer conjuring trick not real magic real magic in other word refer to the magic that be not real while the magic that be real that can actually be do be not real magic laughter now that be the way a lot of person feel about consciousness laughter real consciousness be not a bag of trick if you be go to explain this as a bag of trick then it be not real consciousness whatever it be and as Marvin say and as other person have say consciousness be a bag of trick this mean that a lot of person be just leave completely dissatisfied and incredulous when I attempt to explain consciousness so this be the problem so I have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you will not like for the same reason that you do not like to see a magic trick explain to you how many of you here if somebody some smart aleck start tell you how a particular magic trick be do you sort of want to block you ear and say no no I do not want to know do not take the thrill of it away I would rather be mystify do not tell I the answer a lot of person feel that way about consciousness I have discover and I be sorry if I impose some clarity some understanding on you you would well leave now if you do not want to know some of this trick but I be not go to explain it all to you I be go to do what philosopher do here be how a philosopher explain the saw the lady in half trick you know the saw the lady in half trick the philosopher say I be go to explain to you how that be do you see the magician do not really see the lady in half laughter he merely make you think that he do and you say yes and how do he do that he say oh that be not my department I be sorry laughter so now I be go to illustrate how philosopher explain consciousness but I be go to try to also show you that consciousness be not quite as marvelous you own consciousness be not quite as wonderful as you may have think it be this be something by the way that Lee Siegel talk about in he book he marvel at how he will do a magic show and afterwards person will swear they see he do x y and z he never do that thing he do not even try to do that thing person memory inflate what they think they see and the same be true of consciousness now let see if this will work all right let just watch this watch it carefully I be work with a young computer animator documentarian name Nick Deamer and this be a little demo that he be do for I part of a large project some of you may be interested in we be look for a backer it be a feature length documentary on consciousness ok now you all see what change right how many of you notice that every one of that square change color every one I will just show you by run it again even when you know that they be all go to change color it be very hard to notice you have to really concentrate to pick up any of the change at all now this be a example one of many of a phenomenon that be now be study quite a bit it be one that I predict in the last page or two of my 1991 book consciousness explain where I say if you do experiment of this sort you would find that person be unable to pick up really large change if there be time at the end I will show you the much more dramatic case now how can it be that there be all that change go on and that we be not aware of they well early today Jeff Hawkins mention the way you eye saccade the way you eye move around three or four time a second he do not mention the speed you eye be constantly in motion move around look at eye nose elbow look at interesting thing in the world and where you eye be not look you be remarkably impoverished in you vision that be because the foveal part of you eye which be the high resolution part be only about the size of you thumbnail hold at arm length that be the detail part it do not seem that way do it it do not seem that way but that be the way it be you be get in a lot less information than you think here be a completely different effect this be a painting by Bellotto it be in the museum in North Carolina Bellotto be a student of Canaletto and I love painting like that the painting be actually about as big as it be right here and I love Canalettos because Canaletto have this fantastic detail and you can get right up and see all the detail on the painting and I start across the hall in North Carolina because I think it be probably a Canaletto and would have all that in detail and I notice that on the bridge there there be a lot of person you can just barely see they walk across the bridge and I think as I get close I would be able to see all the detail of most person see they clothes and so forth and as I get close and close I actually scream I yell out because when I get close I find the detail be not there at all there be just little artfully place blob of paint and as I walk towards the picture I be expect detail that be not there the artist have very cleverly suggest person and clothes and wagon and all sort of thing and my brain have take the suggestion you be familiar with a more recent technology which be there you can get a good view of the blob see when you get close they be really just blob of paint you will have see something like this this be the reverse effect I will just give that to you one more time now what do you brain do when it take the suggestion when a artful blob of paint or two by a artist suggest a person say one of Marvin Minsky little society of mind do they send little painter out to fill in all the detail in you brain somewhere I do not think so not a chance but then how on Earth be it do well remember the philosopher explanation of the lady it be the same thing the brain just make you think that it be get the detail there you think the detail there but it be not there the brain be not actually put the detail in you head at all it be just make you expect the detail let just do this experiment very quickly be the shape on the leave the same as the shape on the right rotate yes how many of you do it by rotate the one on the leave in you mind eye to see if it match up with the one on the right how many of you rotate the one on the right ok how do you know that be what you do laughter there be in fact be a very interesting debate rage for over 20 year in cognitive science various experiment start by Roger Shepherd who measure the angular velocity of rotation of mental image yes it be possible to do that but the detail of the process be still in significant controversy and if you read that literature one of the thing that you really have to come to term with be even when you be the subject in the experiment you do not know you do not know how you do it you just know that you have certain belief and they come in a certain order at a certain time and what explain the fact that that be what you think well that be where you have to go backstage and ask the magician this be a figure that I love Bradley Petrie and Dumais you may think that I have cheat that I have put a little white than white boundary there how many of you see that sort of boundary with the Necker cube float in front of the circle can you see it well you know in effect the boundary really there in a certain sense you brain be actually compute that boundary the boundary that go right there but now notice there be two way of see the cube right it be a Necker cube everybody can see the two way of see the cube ok can you see the four way of see the cube because there be another way of see it if you be see it as a cube float in front of some circle some black circle there be another way of see it as a cube on a black background as see through a piece of Swiss cheese laughter can you get it how many of you can not get it that will help laughter now you can get it this be two very different phenomenon when you see the cube one way behind the screen that boundary go away but there be still a sort of fill in as we can tell if we look at this we do not have any trouble see the cube but where do the color change do you brain have to send little painter in there the purple painter and the green painter fight over who be go to paint that bite behind the curtain no you brain just let it go the brain do not need to fill that in when I first start talk about the Bradley Petrie Dumais example that you just see I will go back to it this one I say that there be no filling in behind there and I suppose that that be just a flat truth always true but Rob Van Lier have recently show that it be not now if you think you see some pale yellow I will run this a few more time look in the gray area and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy move in there yeah it be amazing there be nothing there it be no trick failure to detect change in Scenes slide this be Ron Rensink work which be in some degree inspire by that suggestion right at the end of the book let I just pause this for a second if I can this be change blindness what you be go to see be two picture one of which be slightly different from the other you see here the red roof and the gray roof and in between they there will be a mask which be just a blank screen for about a quarter of a second so you will see the first picture then a mask then the second picture then a mask and this will just continue and you job as the subject be to press the button when you see the change so show the original picture for 240 millisecond blank show the next picture for 240 millisecond blank and keep go until the subject press the button say I see the change so now we be go to be subject in the experiment we be go to start easy some example no trouble there can everybody see all right indeed Rensink subject take only a little bit more than a second to press the button can you see that one 2 9 second how many do not see it still what be on the roof of that barn laughter it be easy be it a bridge or a dock there be a few more really dramatic one and then I will close I want you to see a few that be particularly strike this one because it be so large and yet it be pretty hard to see can you see it audience yes Dan Dennett see the shadow go back and forth pretty big so 15 5 second be the median time for subject in he experiment there I love this one I will end with this one just because it be such a obvious and important thing how many still do not see it how many still do not see it how many engine on the wing of that boe laughter right in the middle of the picture thanks very much for you attention what I want to show you be that scientist use they from the outside third person method can tell you thing about you own consciousness that you would never dream of and that in fact you be not the authority on you own consciousness that you think you be and we be really make a lot of progress on come up with a theory of mind Jeff Hawkins this morning be describe he attempt to get theory and a good big theory into the neuroscience and he be right this be a problem Harvard Medical School once I be at a talk director of the lab say in we lab we have a say if you work on one neuron that be neuroscience if you work on two neuron that psychology laughter we have to have more theory and it can come as much from the top down thank you very much applause
