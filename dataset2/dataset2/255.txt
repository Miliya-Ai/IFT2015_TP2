I think I would tell you a little about what I like to write and I like to immerse myself in my topic I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig and I see my life as a series of experiment so I work for Esquire magazine and a couple of year ago I write a article call my outsource life where I hire a team of person in Bangalore India to live my life for I so they answer my email they answer my phone they argue with my wife for I and they read my son bedtime story it be the good month of my life because I just sit back and I read book and watch movie it be a wonderful experience more recently I write a article for Esquire call about radical honesty and this be a movement where this be start by a psychologist in Virginia who say that you should never ever lie except maybe during poker and golf he only exception and more than that whatever be on you brain should come out of you mouth so I decide I would try this for a month this be the bad month of my life laughter I do not recommend this at all to give you a sense of the experience the article be call I think you be fat laughter so that be hard my most recent book my previous book be call the Know it all and it be about the year I spend read the Encyclopedia Britannica from a to z in my quest to learn everything in the world or more precisely from aak which be a type of east Asian music all the way to Zwyiec which be well I do not want to ruin the end laughter it be a very exciting twist end like a o Henry novel so I will not ruin it but I love that one because that be a experiment about how much information one human brain could absorb although listen to Kevin Kelly you do not have to remember anything you can just Google it so I waste some time there I love that experiment but I think that the most profound and life change experiment that I have do be my most recent experiment where I spend a year try to follow all of the rule of the Bible The Year of live biblically and I undertake this for two reason the first be that I grow up with no religion at all as I say in my book I be Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden be Italian laughter so not very but I have become increasingly interested in religion I do think it be the define issue of we time or one of the main one and I have a son I want to know what to teach he so I decide to dive in head first and try to live the Bible the second reason I undertake this be because I be concern about the rise of fundamentalism religious fundamentalism and person who say they take the Bible literally which be accord to some poll as high as 45 or 50 percent of America so I decide what if you really do take the Bible literally I decide to take it to its logical conclusion and take everything in the Bible literally without pick and choose the first thing I do be I get a stack of bible I have Christian bible I have Jewish bible a friend of mine send I something call a hip hop bible where the twenty third Psalm be render as the Lord be all that as oppose to what I know it as the Lord be my shepherd then I go down and I read several version and I write down every single law that I could find and this be a very long list over 700 rule and they range from the famous one that I have hear of the ten commandment love you neighbor be fruitful and multiply so I want to follow that and actually I take my project very seriously because I have twin during my year so I definitely take my project seriously but I also want to follow the hundred of arcane and obscure law that be in the Bible there be the law in Leviticus you can not shave the corner of you beard I do not know where my corner be so I decide to let the whole thing grow and this be what I look like by the end as you can imagine I spend a lot of time at airport security laughter my wife would not kiss I for the last two month so certainly the challenge be there the Bible say you can not wear clothes make of mixed fiber so I think sound strange but I will try it you only know if you try it I get rid of all my poly cotton t shirt the Bible say that if two man be in a fight and the wife of one of that man grab the testicle of the other man then she hand shall be cut off so I want to follow that rule laughter that one I follow by default by not get in a fight with a man whose wife be stand nearby look like she have a strong grip laughter so oh there be another shot of my beard I will say it be a amazing year because it really be life change and incredibly challenging and there be two type of law that be particularly challenge the first be avoid the little sin that we all commit every day you know I could spend a year not kill but spend a year not gossip not covet not lie you know I live in New York and I work as a journalist so this be 75 80 percent of my day I have to do it but it be really interesting because I be able to make some progress because I could not believe how much my behavior change my thought this be one of the huge lesson of the year be that I almost pretend to be a good person and I become a little bit of a good person so I have always think you know you change you mind and you change you behavior but it be often the other way around you change you behavior and you change you mind so you know if you want to become more compassionate you visit sick person in the hospital and you will become more compassionate you donate money to a cause and you become emotionally involve in that cause so it really be cognitive psychology you know cognitive dissonance that I be experience the Bible actually talk about cognitive psychology very primitive cognitive psychology in the proverb it say that if you smile you will become happy which as we know be actually true the second type of rule that be difficult to obey be the rule that will get you into a little trouble in twenty first century America and perhaps the clear example of this be stone adulterer laughter but it be a big part of the Bible so I figure I have to address it so I be able to stone one adulterer it happen I be in the park and I be dress in my biblical clothing so sandal and sort of a white robe you know because again the outer affect the inner I want to see how dress biblically affect my mind and this man come up to I and he say why be you dress like that and I explain my project and he say well I be a adulterer be you go to stone I and I say well that would be great laughter and I actually take out a handful of stone from my pocket that I have be carry around for week hope for just this interaction and you know they be pebble but he grab they out of my hand he be actually a elderly man mid 70 just so you know but he be still a adulterer and still quite angry he grab they out of my hand and throw they at my face and I feel that I could eye for a eye I could retaliate and throw one back at he so that be my experience stone and it do allow I to talk about in a more serious way this big issue how can the Bible be so barbaric in some place and yet so incredibly wise in other how should we view the Bible should we view it you know as original intent like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible how be the Bible write and actually since this be a tech crowd I talk in the book about how the Bible actually remind I of the Wikipedia because it have all of this author and editor over hundred of year and it be sort of evolve it be not a book that be write and come down from on high so I think I would end by tell you just a couple of the take away the big lesson that I learn from my year the first be thou shalt not take the Bible literally this become very very clear early on because if you do then you end up act like a crazy person and stone adulterer or here be another example well that be another I do spend some time shepherd laughter it be a very relaxing vocation I recommend it but this one be the Bible say that you can not touch woman during certain time of the month and more than that you can not sit on a seat where a menstruate woman have sit and my wife think this be very offensive so she sit in every seat in we apartment and I have to spend much of the year stand until I buy my own seat and carry it around so you know I meet with creationist I go to the creationist museum and this be the ultimate literalist and it be fascinating because they be not stupid person at all I would wager that they iq be exactly the same as the average evolutionist it be just that they faith be so strong in this literal interpretation of the Bible that they distort all the datum to fit they model and they go through this amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this and I will say though the museum be gorgeous they really do a fantastic job if you be ever in Kentucky there be you can see a movie of the flood and they have sprinkler in the ceiling that will sprinkle on you during the flood scene so whatever you think of creationism and I think it be crazy they do a great job laughter another lesson be that thou shalt give thanks and this one be a big lesson because I be pray give this prayer of thanksgiving which be odd for a agnostic but I be say thanks all the time every day and I start to change my perspective and I start to realize the hundred of little thing that go right every day that I do not even notice that I take for grant as oppose to focus on the three or four that go wrong so this be actually a key to happiness for I be to just remember when I come over here the car do not flip over and I do not trip come up the stair it be a remarkable thing third that thou shall have reverence this one be unexpected because I start the year as a agnostic and by the end of the year I become what a friend of mine call a reverent agnostic which I love and I be try to start it as a movement so if anyone want to join the basic idea be whether or not there be a God there be something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness and that we ritual can be sacred the Sabbath can be sacred this be one of the great thing about my year do the Sabbath because I be a workaholic so have this one day where you can not work it really that change my life so this idea of sacredness whether or not there be a God thou shall not stereotype this one happen because I spend a lot of time with various religious community throughout America because I want it to be more than about my journey I want it to be about religion in America so I spend time with Evangelical Christian and hasidic Jews and the amish i be very proud because I think I be the only person in America to out Bible talk a Jehovah Witness laughter after three and a half hour he look at he watch he be like I get ta go laughter oh thank you very much thank you bless you bless you but it be interesting because I have some very preconceived notion about for instance Evangelical christianity and I find that it be such a wide and varied movement that it be difficult to make generalization about it there be a group I meet with call the Red Letter Christian and they focus on the red word in the Bible which be the one that Jesus speak that be how they print they in the old bible and they argument be that Jesus never talk about homosexuality they have a pamphlet that say here be what Jesus say about homosexuality and you open it up and there be nothing in it so they say Jesus do talk a lot about help the outcast help poor person so this be very inspiring to I I recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo they be very inspiring leader even though I disagree with much of what they say also thou shalt not disregard the irrational this one be very unexpected because you know I grow up with the scientific worldview and I be shocked learn how much of my life be govern by irrational force and the thing be if they be not harmful they be not to be completely dismiss because I learn that I be think I be do all this ritual this biblical ritual separate my wool and linen and I would ask this religious person why would the Bible possibly tell we to do this why would God care and they say we do not know but it be just ritual that give we mean and I would say but that be crazy and they would say well what about you you blow out candle on top of a birthday cake if a guy from Mars come down and see here be one guy blow out the fire on top of a cake versus another guy not wear clothes of mixed fabric would the Martian say well that guy he make sense but that guy crazy so no I think that ritual be by nature irrational so the key be to choose the right ritual the one that be not harmful but ritual by themselves be not to be dismiss and finally I learn that thou shall pick and choose and this one I learn because I try to follow everything in the Bible and I fail miserably because you can not you have to pick and choose and anyone who follow the Bible be go to be pick and choose the key be to pick and choose the right part there be the phrase call cafeteria religion and the fundamentalist will use it in a denigrate way and they will say oh it be just cafeteria religion you be just pick and choose but my argument be what be wrong with cafeteria I have have some great meal at cafeteria I have also have some meal that make I want to dry heave so it be about choose the part of the Bible about compassion about tolerance about love you neighbor as oppose to the part about homosexuality be a sin or intolerance or violence which be very much in the Bible as well so if we be to find any meaning in this book then we have to really engage it and wrestle with it and I think I would end with just a couple more there be I read the Bible that be how I hail taxicab laughter seriously and it work and yes that be actually a rented sheep so I have to return that in the morning but it serve well for a day so anyway thank you so much for let I speak
