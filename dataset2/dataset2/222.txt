I start juggle a long time ago but long before that I be a golfer and that be what I be a golfer and as a golfer and as a kid one of the thing that really sort of seep into my pore that I sort of live my whole life be process and it be the process of learn thing one of the great thing be that my father be a avid golfer but he be lefty and he have a real passion for golf and he also create this whole mythology about Ben Hogan and various thing well I learn a lot about interesting thing that I know nothing about at the time but grow to know stuff about and that be the mythology of skill so one of the thing that I love to do be to explore skill and since Richard put I on this whole thing with music I be suppose to actually be do a project with Tod Machover with the MIT Media Lab it relate a lot to music but Tod could not come and the project be sort of somewhere I be not sure whether it be happen the way we think or not but I be go to explore skill and juggling and basically visual music I guess ok you can start the music thanks Music applause thanks thank you now juggle can be a lot of fun play with skill and play with space play with rhythm and you can turn the mike on now I be go to do a couple of piece I do a big piece in a triangle and this be three section from it Part of the challenge be to try to understand rhythm and space use not just my hand because a lot of juggle be hand orient but use the rhythm of my body and foot and control the ball with my foot applause thanks now this next section be a attempt to explore space you see I think Richard say something about person that be against something well a lot of person think juggler defy gravity or do stuff well I kind of from my childhood and golf and all that it be a process of join with force and so what I would like to do be try to figure out how to join with the space through the technique so juggle gravity up down if you figure out what up and down really be it be a complex physical set of skill to be able to throw a ball down and up and everything but then you add in sideways applause now I look at it somewhat as a way when you learn juggle what you learn be how to feel with you eye and see with you hand because you be not look at you hand you be look at where the ball be or you be look at the audience so this next part be really a way of understanding space and rhythm with the obvious reference to the foot but it be also time where the foot be where the ball be applause thanks so visual music rhythm and complexity I be go to build towards complexity now juggle three ball be simple and normal laughter excuse i laughter we be juggler ok and remember you be transpose you be get into a subculture here laughter and juggle the ball cross and all that ok if you keep they in they assign path you get parallel line of different height but then hopefully even rhythm and you can change the rhythm good Michael you can change the rhythm if you get out of the light ok change the rhythm so it be even or you can go back and change the height now skill but you be box in if you can only do it up and down that way so you have get to go after the space down there ok then you have get to combine they because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you and then you get crazy applause now I be actually go to ask you to try something so you have get to pay attention complexity if you spend enough time do something time slow down or you skill increase so you perception change it be learn skill like be in a high speed car crash thing slow down as you learn as you learn as you learn you may not be able to affect it it almost drift on you it go but that be the close approximation I can have to it so complexity now how many here be juggler ok so most of you be go to have a similar reaction to this ok and whoever laugh there you understand it completely right laughter no it look like a mess it look like a mess with a guy there who be get he hand around that mess ok well that be what juggling be about right it be be able to do something that other person can not do or can not understand all right so that be one way of do it which be five ball down ok another way be the outside and you could play with the rhythm same pattern make it fast and small make it wide make it narrow bring it back up ok it be do thanks applause now what I want to get to be that you be all very bright very tactile I have no idea how computer orient or three dimensionally orient you be but let try something ok so since you all do not understand what the five ball pattern be I be go to give you a little clue Enough of a clue so you get the pattern right ok laughter you be not get off that easy all right now do I a favor follow the ball that I ask you to follow Green Yellow Pink White ok you can do that yeah ok now let actually learn something actually let I put you in that area of learning which be very insecure you want to do it yeah ok hand out in front of you Palms up together what you be go to learn be this laughter ok so what I want you to do be just listen to I and do it Index finger middle finger ring little little ring middle index and then open finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger a little bit fast finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger laughter all right a lot of different learning process go on in here laughter one learning process that I see be this laughter ok another learning process that I see be this laughter ok so everybody take a deep breath in breath out ok now one more time and finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger Open Finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger ok Shake you hand out now I assume a lot of you spend a lot of time at a computer ok so what you be do be you be go la la la and you be get this ok so that be exactly what I be go to ask you to do but in a slightly different way you be go to combine it so what I want you to do be finger I will tell you what to do with you finger same thing but I want you to do be also with you eye be follow the color ball that I ask you to follow laughter ok here we go so we be go to start off look at the white ball and I be go to tell you which color and I be also go to tell you to go with you finger ok so white ball and finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger Pink Finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger green finger finger finger finger yellow finger finger finger pink or finger Pink finger finger finger finger finger finger finger all right applause how do you do well ok the reason I want you to do this be because that be actually what most person face throughout they life a moment of learn a moment of challenge it be a moment that you can not make sense of why the hell should I learn this ok do it really have anything to do with anything in my life you know I can not decipher be it fun be it challenging be I suppose to cheat laughter you know what be you suppose to do you have get somebody up here who be the operative principle of do that for he whole life ok try to figure that stuff out but be it go to get you anywhere it be just a moment that be all it be a moment ok I be go to change the script for one second just let I do this I do not need music for it talk about time in a moment there be a piece that I recently develop which be all about that a moment and what I do as a creative artist be I develop vocabulary or language of move object what I have do for you here I develop a lot of that trick and I put the choreography together but they be not original technique now I be go to start show you some original technique that come from the work that I have develop ok so a moment how would you define a moment well as a juggler what I want to do be create something that be representational of a moment Ahhh All right I be go to get on my knee and do it so a moment rattle ok and then what I do as a juggler be say ok what can I do to make that something that be dependent on something else another dynamic rattling so a moment rattle another moment rattle excuse I still get there a moment that travel rattle a moment no we will try that again it separate and come back together Time how can you look at time and what do you dedicate it to in explore a particular thing well obviously there be something in here and you can all have a guess as to what it be there be a mystery there be a mystery in the moment and it have to settle and then it be dependent on something else and then it come to rest just a little thing about time now this have expand into a much big piece because I use ramp of different parabola that I roll the ball on while I be keep time with this but I just think I would talk about a moment applause all right ok can we show the video of the triangle be we ready to do that yes this be the piece that I tell you about it be a much big piece that I do explore the space of a geometric triangle applause thanks the only thing I will say about the last session be you ever try juggle and drive the car with you knee at 120 mile a hour laughter the only other thing be it be a real shock I always drive motorcycle and when I buy my first car it shock I that it cost three time more than my parent house interesting anyway balance constant movement to find a approach to stillness cheat laughter balance make up the rule so you can not cheat so you learn to approach stillness with different part of you body to have a conversation with it to speak to listen laughter hup now it be dependent on rhythm and keep a center of balance when it fall go underneath so there be a rhythm to it the rhythm can get much small as you skill increase you learn to find that tiny space that tiny movement thanks applause now I be go to show you the beginning of a piece that be about balance in some way and also oh actually if you be bored not here here be one use for it laughter you can go with the Sticks one music music applause thanks that have a certain kind of balance to it which be all about plumb I apprentice with a carpenter and learn about plumb square and level and they influence that and this next piece which I will do a little segment of two stick you can go with it thanks which be again explore space or the line in space music applause work with space and the line in space in a different way oh let see here applause so I will come back to that in a second but work with one ball now what if you attach something to it or change it this be a little thing that I make because I really like the idea of curve and ball together and then create space and the rhythm of space use the surface of the ball the surface of the arm just a little toy which lead I to the next thing which be what have I get here ok all right I be actually lead up to something the new thing that I be work on this be not it this be explore geometry and the rhythm of shape applause now what I just do be I work with the mathematics the diameter and the circumference sometimes this piece be mathematical in that way that I look at a shape and say what about if I use this and this and this sometimes what happen in life affect my choice of object that I try to work with the next piece that I be go to do which be the cylinder piece if you want to get that up it have to do with cylinder seal from about 5 000 year ago which be stone with design that be use to roll over wet clay with all sort of great design I love ceramic and all of that it be a combination of that the beauty of that the shape and the story that be involve in it as well as the fact that they protect the contents the second influence on this piece come from recycling and look into a tin can recycling bin and see all that beautiful emptiness so if you want to go with the music for cylinder music applause talk about geometry and everything if you take the circle and you split it in half can you run s curve music I be go to do just a short version of it circle split in half and rotate and mythology music applause anyway that piece also have a kinetic sculpture in the middle of it and I dance around a small stage so two minute just to end the late piece that I be work on what I love be that I never know what I be work on why I be work on it they be not idea they be instinct and the late thing that I be work on clatter be something really I do not know what it be yet and that be good I like not to know for as long as possible well because then it tell I the truth instead of I impose the truth and what it be be work with both positive and negative space but also with this curve and what it involve and I do not know if my hand be too beat up to do it or not but I will do a little bit of it it initially start off with I stack this thing bunch of they and then play with the sense of space of fill in the space and then it start change and become folding on themselves and then change level because my attempt be to make visual instrument not to just make I will try one other thing for work in three dimension with you perception of space and time now I do not know exactly where it be go but I have get a bit of effort involve in this thing and it be go to change as I go through it but I really like it it feel right this may not be the right shape and look at this shape and then I will show you the first design I ever put to it just to see just to play because I love all different kind of thing to play with let see here to work with the positive and negative in a different way and to change and to change so I be off in my new direction with this to explore rhythm and space we will see what I come up with thanks for have I applause
