I be a or be or kind of be a toy designer and before I be a toy designer oh I be a mime a street mime actually and then I be a entertainer I guess and before that I be a silversmith and before that I be I be out of the house at about 15 and a half and I never wind up go into college I do not really I do not see the point at the time I do now after learn about all the quantum stuff laughter it be really cool anyway I want to show you a little bit about the world of toy design at least from my small aperture of the world this be a video I make when I first start do toy design I be in my garage make weird stuff and then you go to this toy company and there be some guy across the table and he go pass Pass pass you know you think it be so cool but they anyway I make this little tape that I have always show when I go in this be the name of my company give Toys so I use to work at Mattel actually and after I leave Mattel I start all this hamburger maker and then get the license to make the maker so this be a hamburger maker that you take the peanut butter and stuff and you put it in there and it make and this be a French fry maker little tiny food you can eat I beat up the pasta maker to make that then this be a mcnugget maker I think this now that be the McNugget maker and this be a this be my old daughter make a McApple Pie and let see you can make the pie and cinnamon and sugar and then you eat and you eat and you eat and you she be about 300 pound now no she be not she be beautiful this be how they look when they come out at the end this be a this be like a 15 million dollar line and it get I through some I do not make any royalty on this but it get I through Next be a compilation of a bunch of stuff that be a missile foam launcher that do not get sell this be a squishy head for no apparent reason this be some effect that I do for Wig rattle and roll that be a robot eye thing control it in the back that pay the rent for about a month this be a walk Barbie I say oh this be it and they go oh that be really nice and out it go so this be some fighting robot I think everyone would want this they fight they get back up you know would not this be cool and they make it into a toy and then they drop it like a hot rock they be pretty cool this be a we be do some flight testing on my little pug see if this can really grab it do pretty good I be use little phone connector to make they so they can spin it be how they see have that album thing kid do not know what they be this be a clay maker you know I say I go to Play Doh and say look I can animate this they say do not talk to we about play Doh and then I make a Lego animator I think this would be so great and you know Lego do not take lego to Lego that be the answer they know everything about it then I start do animatronic I love dinosaur I use to be in the film business kind of and actually Nicholas Negroponte see this when I be like 12 and anyway so then they say no you have to make two and they have to fight you know how why would a kid want a dinosaur this be I use unclear or 3 d Studio back in the 80 that be David Letterman you can see how old this stuff be that be my young cousin this be a segment call dangerous Toys you will not see at Christmas we have my first saw blade launcher and we have a flamethrower chair my career basically peak here and in the back be foam core cutout of the person who could not make it to the show this be MEK go through a windshield wiper motor so this be a I use to kind of be a actor and I be really not very good at it but the this be a guy name Dr Yatz who would take toy apart and show kid about engineer and you can see the massively parallel processing Nintendos there and over to the left be a view master of the cd rom and a guy name Stan Reznikov do this as a pilot this be a you can see the little window there you can actually see the Steadicam with a bubble on the bottom you see the keyboard strap to my wrist way ahead of my time here Video I be get dizzy narrator I love toy Caleb Chung that be all I want to say there I love toy ok so so that be a that be the first kind of a that be the first batch of product most of they do not go you get one out of 20 one out of 30 product and every now and then we do something like a you know a automate hair wrap machine you know that tangle you hair and pull you scalp out and and we would make some money on that you know and we would give it out but eventually we leave L A and we move to Idaho where there be actually a lot of peace and quiet and I start work on this project oh I have to tell you about this real quick throughout this whole thing make toy I think there be a real correlation with innovation and art and science there be some kind of a blend that happen that allow you know to find innovation and I try to sum this up in some kind of symbol that mean something to I anyway and so art and science have a kind of dynamic balance that be where I think innovation happen and actually this be to I how I can come up with great idea but it be not how you actually get leverage actually you have to put a circle around that and call it business and that three together I think give you leverage in the world but move on so this be a quick tale I be go to tell this be the Furby tale as he say I be co inventor of the Furby I do the body and creature well you will see so by way of show you this you can kind of get a understanding of what it be to hopefully try to create robotic life form or technology that have a emotional connection with the user so this be my family this be my wife Christi and Abby and Melissa and my 17 year old now Emily who be just a pack of trouble all right there be that robot again I come out of the movie business as I say and I say let make this animatronic robot let make this thing and so I have always have a big interest in this this one actually do not go anywhere but I get my foot wet do this this be a small one and I have a little move torso on there a little tiny guy walk along more servo drive lot of servo hacking lot of mechanical stuff there be another one he actually have skeletor leg I think he be wear there oh this be a little pony little pony very cute little thing the point of show this be I have always be interested in little artificial life piece so the challenge be I work for Microsoft for a little bit work on the Microsoft Barney and this be a you know the purple dinosaur with kind of bloat wear and you know they have lot just lot of stuff in there that you do not need I think and then Microsoft can just fill a you know a warehouse full of this stuff and see if they sell so it be a really strange business model compare to come from a toy company but anyway a friend of mine and I Dave Hampton decide to see if we could do like a single cell organism what be the few piece we could use to make a little life form and that be we little thirty cent Mabuchi motor and so I have all this design book like I be sure many of you have and throughout the book this be the first page on Furby I have kind of the art and science I have the why over here and the how over there I try to do a lot of philosophy a lot of think about all of this project because they be not just bing idea you have to really dig deep in this thing so there be some real pseudo code over here and get the idea of different kind of drive thing like that and originally Furby only have two eye and some battery on the bottom and then we say well you be go to feed he and he need to talk and it get more complicated and then I have to figure out how I be go to use that one motor to make the eye move and the ear move and the body to move and the mouth to move and you know I want to make it blink and do all that at the same time well I come up with this kind of linear expression thing with this cam and feedback and that work pretty well then I start to get a little more realistic and I have to start draw the stuff and there be my note to self at the top lot of engineering so that turn out to be a little more than true there be my first explode view and all the little piece and the little worm drive and all that stuff and then I have get to start build it so this be the real thing I get up and start cut my finger and glue thing together and that be my little workshop and there be the first little cam that drive Furby and there be Furby on the half shell you can see the little BB in the box be my tilt sensor I just basically gnaw all this stuff out of plastic so there be the back of he head with a billion hole in it and there I be I be do there be my little Furby No it be a little robot on heroin or something I think laughter so right now you see I love little robot so my wife say well you may like it but nobody else will so she come to the rescue this be my wife Christi who be just you know my muse and my partner for eternity here and she do draw right she be a actual you know artist and she start do all this different drawing and do color pattern and coloring book and I like the guy with the cigar at the bottom there he do not test so well but I like he and then she start do this other image at that time Beanie Babies be a big hit and we think we will do a bunch of different one so here be a little pink one a little pouf on he head and here be this do not do so well in testing either I do not know why there be my favorite demon Furby that be a good one anyway finally settle on kind of this kind of a look little poufy body a little imaginary character and there he be a little bush baby on catch in the headlight there I actually go to Toys R we get a little furry cat rip it apart and make this and since then every time I come home from Toys R we with doll or something they disappear from my desk and they get hide in the house I have three girl and they just they it be like a rescue animal thing they be go there laughter so a little tether come off it be just a control for the Fur mouth and he eye it be just a little server control and I make a little video go hi my name Furby and I be good you know and then I would reach my hand he have you can tickle he when I put my hand up ha ha ha ha and that be how we sell he and Hasbro actually say I mean Tiger Electronics at the time say yeah we want to do this we have you know 13 week or something to Toy Fair and we be go to hire you guy to do this and so Dave and I get work mostly I because it be all mechanic at this point so now I have to really figure out all kind of stuff I do not know how to do and I start work with Solid Works and a whole other group to do that and we start this be way back before there be really much SLA go on not a lot of rapid prototyping we certainly do not have the money to do this they only pay I like a little bit of money to do this so I have to call a friend of a friend who be run the GM prototype plant sla plant that be down and they say yeah well we will run they so they run all the shell for we which be nice of they and the cam I get cut at Hewlett Packard we snuck in on the weekend and so we just have a disc of the file but they have a closed system so you could not print the thing out on the machine so we actually print they out on clear and tape they on the monitor and on the weekend we run the part for that so this be how they come out close to the end and then they look like little garfield there eight month later you may remember this this be a total total total chaos for a while they be make two million Furbys a month they actually wind up do about 40 million Furbys I it be unbelievable how I do not know how that can be and Hasbro make about you know a billion and a half dollar and I just a little bit on each one so full circle why do I do this why do you you know try to do this stuff and it be of course for you kid and there be my young daughter with she Furbys and she still actually have that so I kind of retire and we be already live in paradise up in Boise on a river you know so and then I start another company call Toy Innovation and we do some project with Mattel with actually with a lady who be here Ivy Ross and we do miracle move baby make it in Wired magazine do a bunch of other stuff and then I start another company we do a little hand hold device for teens that could hook up to the internet win good innovation at CES but really I kind of slow down and say ok I just after a while I have this old tape of this dinosaur and I give it to this guy and this other guy see it and then person start to want to do it and they say they would spend all this time so I say ok let try to do this dinosaur project the crazy idea be we be go to try to clone a dinosaur as much as we can with today technology and it be not really but as close as we can do and we be go to try to really pull this off intentfully try to make something that seem like it be alive not a robot that kind of do but let really go for it so I pick a Camarasaurus because the Camarasaurus be the most abundant of the sauropod in North America and you could actually find full fossil evidence of this that be a juvenile and so we actually go in there be a book call walk on Eggshells where they find actual sauropod skin in Patagonia and the picture from the book so when I I tell the sculptor to use this bump pattern whatever you can to copy that very very obsessive there be a kind of truncate Camarasaurus skeleton but the geometry correct and then I go in and measure all the geometry because I figure hey biomimicry if I do it kind of right it might move kind of like the real thing so there be the motor and about this time you know all this other person be start to help here be a example of what we do with the skull there be the skull there be my drawing of a skull there be kind of the skin version of the soft tissue there be the mechanism that would go in there kind of a Geneva drive there be some Solid Works version of it here be some sla part of the same thing and then this be really crude piece we be just do some test here there be the skull pretty much the same shape as the Camarasaurus there be a photorealistic eye behind a lens and there be kind of the first explode view or see through view there be the first sla version and it already kind of have the feel it have kind of a cuteness already and the thing about blend science and art in this multidisciplinary stuff be you can do a robot and then you go back and do the shape and then you go back and forth the servo in the front leg we have to shape that like muscle they have to fit within the envelope there be a tremendous amount of work to get all that work right all the neck and the tail be cable so it move smoothly and organically and then of course you be not do yet you have to get the look for the skin the skin a whole another thing probably the hard part so you hire artist and you try to get the look and feel of the character now this be not we be character designer right and we be still try to keep with the real character so now you go back and you cover the whole thing with clay now you start do the sculpture for this and you can see we get a guy from who be just a fanatic about dinosaur to do the sculpting for we down to the spoon shape tooth and everything and then more sculpting and then more sculpting and then more sculpting and then more sculpting and then four year and 10 million dollar later we have a little Pleo John do you want to bring he up John Sosoka be we cto and be really the man that be do most of the work with we 40 person company I would like to give John a hand he never get recognition this be John Sosoka applause so thank you John thank you and get back to work all right man all right laughter no it be very painful so laughter this be little Pleos and you can probably see they this I on purpose they go through life stage so when you first get they they be baby and you more you have they kind of the old they get and they kind of learn through they behavior so this one this one actually asleep and hang on Pleo wake up Pleo come on so this guy listen to my voice here but they have 40 sensor all over they body they have seven processor they have 14 motor they have but you do not care do you they be just cute right that be the idea that be the idea so you see hey come on hey do you feel that there be something big and loud over here hey laughter that be good wake up wake up wake up yeah they be like kid you know you yeah yeah okay he be hungry I will show you what he be be do for for four year here here here have some money pleo laughter there you go that be what the investor think that it be just laughter right right so they be really sweet little guy and we be hope that you know we belief be that human need to feel empathy towards thing in order to be more human and we think we can help that out by have little creature that you can love now this be not robot they be kind of lovebot you know they do change over time but mostly they evoke a feeling of care and we have a I have a little something here now I do want to say that you know Ugobe be not there yet we have just open the door and it be for all of you to step through it we do include some thing that be hopefully useful excuse I pleo they he have a usb and he have a sd card so it be completely open architecture so anyone can plug he applause thank you this be John over here anyone can take Pleo and they can totally redo he personality you can make he bipolar or as someone say a laughter you can change he homeostatic drive or whatever you want to call they kid can just drag and drop put in new sound we actually it be very hard to keep person from do this we have one animator who be take it and he be do a take on the Budweiser beer commercial and they be go Whassup you know laughter you so it be yes he like that so they be a handful we hope you get one I do not know what I be miss to say but as a last thing I would like to say be that if we continue along this path we be design we child good friend and there be a lot of social responsibility in that that be why Pleo soft and gentle and loving and so I just I hope we all dream well thank you applause
