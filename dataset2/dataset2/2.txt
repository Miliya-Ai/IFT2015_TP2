music the sound of silence Simon Garfunkel Hello voice mail my old friend laughter I have call for tech support again I ignore my boss warning I call on a Monday morning now it be evening and my dinner first grow cold and then grow mold I be still on hold I be listen to the sound of silence I do not think you understand I think you phone line be unmanned I punch every touch tone I be tell but I have still spend 18 hour on hold it be not enough you software crash my Mac and it constantly hang and bomb it erase my rom now the Mac make the sound of silence in my dream I fantasize of wreak vengeance on you guy say you motorcycle crash blood come gush from you gash with you fade strength you call 9 1 1 and you pray for a train MD but you get I laughter and you listen to the sound of silence music applause thank you good evening and welcome to Spot the TED Presenter who use to be a Broadway accompanist laughter when I be offer the Times column six year ago the deal be like this you will be send the cool hot slick new gadget every week it will arrive at you door you get to try they out play with they evaluate they until the novelty wear out before you have to send they back and you will get pay for it you can think about it if you want so I have always be a technology nut and I absolutely love it the job though come with one small downside and that be they intend to publish my email address at the end of every column and what I have notice be first of all you get a incredible amount of email if you ever be feel lonely get a New York Times column because you will get hundred and hundred and hundred of email and the email I be get a lot today be about frustration person be feel like thing ok I just have a alarm come up on my screen Lucky you can not see it person be feel overwhelmed they be feel like it be too much technology too fast it may be good technology but I feel like there be not enough of a support structure there be not enough help there be not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use one time I write a column about my effort to reach Dell Technical Support and within 12 hour there be 700 message from reader on the feedback board on the Times website from user say I too and here be my tale of woe I call it software rage and man let I tell you whoever figure out how to make money off of this frustration will oh how do that get up there just kid laughter ok so why be the problem accelerate and part of the problem be ironically because the industry have put so much thought into make thing easy to use I will show you what I mean this be what the computer interface use to look like DOS over the year it be get easy to use this be the original Mac operating system Reagan be President Madonna be still a brunette and the entire operating system this be the good part the entire operating system fit in 211 k you could not put the Mac OS X logo in 211 k laughter so the irony be that as this thing become easy to use a less technical broad audience be come into contact with this equipment for the first time I once have the distinct privilege of sit in on the Apple call center for a day the guy have a duplicate headset for I to listen to and the call that you know how they say you call may be record for quality assurance uh uh you call may be record so that they can collect the funniest dumb user story and pass they around on a cd laughter which they do laughter and I have a copy laughter it be in you gift bag no no with you voice on it so some of the story be just so classic and yet so understandable a woman call Apple to complain that she mouse be squeak make a squeak noise and the technician say well ma am what do you mean you mouse be squeak she say all I can tell you be that it squeak loud the fast I move it across the screen laughter and the technician like Ma am you have get the mouse up against the screen she go well the message say click here to continue laughter well if you like that one how much time have we get another one a guy call this be absolutely true he computer have crash and he tell the technician he could not restart it no matter how many time he type 11 and the technician say what why be you type 11 he say the message say error type 11 laughter so we must admit that some of the blame fall squarely at the foot of the user but why be the technical overload crisis the complexity crisis accelerate now in the hardware world it be because we the consumer want everything to be small small small so the gadget be get tiny and tiny but we finger be essentially stay the same size so it get to be more and more of a challenge Software be subject to another primal force the mandate to release more and more version when you buy a piece of software it be not like buy a vase or a candy bar where you own it it be more like join a club where you pay due every year and every year they say we have add more feature and we will sell it to you for 99 I know one guy who be spend 4 000 just on photoshop over the year and software company make 35 percent of they revenue from just this software upgrade I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox which be that if you improve a piece of software enough time you eventually ruin it I mean Microsoft Word be last just a word processor in you know the Eisenhower administration laughter but what be the alternative Microsoft actually do this experiment they say well wait a minute everyone complain that we be add so many feature let create a word processor that be just a word processor simple pure do not do web page be not a database and it come out and it be call Microsoft write and none of you be nod in acknowledgment because it die it tank no one ever buy it I call this the Sport Utility Principle People like to surround themselves with unnecessary power right they do not need the database and the website but they be like well I will upgrade because I might you know I might need that someday so the problem be as you add more feature where be they go to go where be you go to stick they you only have so many design tool you can do button you can do slider pop up menu sub menu but if you be not careful about how you choose you wind up with this laughter this be a un retouch this be not a joke un retouch photo of Microsoft Word the copy that you have with all the toolbar open you have obviously never open all the toolbar but all you have to type in be this little teeny window down here laughter and we have arrive at the age of interface matrix where there be so many feature and option you have to do two dimension you know a vertical and a horizontal you guy all complain about how Microsoft Word be always bullete you list and underline you link automatically the off switch be in there somewhere I be tell you it be there part of the art of design a simple good interface be know when to use which one of this feature so here be the log off dialogue box for Windows 2000 there be only four choice so why be they in a pop up menu it be not like the rest of the screen be so full of other component that you need to collapse the choice they could have put they all out in view here be Apple take on the exact same dialogue box applause thank you yes I design the dialogue box no no already we can see that Apple and Microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design Microsoft approach to simplicity tend to be let break it down let just make it more step there be this wizard everywhere and you know there be a new version of Windows come out this fall if they continue at this pace there be absolutely no telling where they might wind up welcome to the type a Word Wizard laughter applause welcome to the type a Word Wizard Ok I will bite let click Next to continue laughter applause from the drop down menu choose the first letter you want to type ok laughter so there be a limit that we do not want to cross so what be the answer how do you pack in all this feature in a simple intelligent way I believe in consistency when possible real world equivalent trash can folder when possible label thing mostly but I beg of the designer here to break all that rule if they violate the big rule of all which be intelligence now what do I mean by that I be go to give you some example where intelligence make something not consistent but it be good if you be buy something on the web you be suppose to put in you address and you be suppose to choose what country you be from ok there be 200 country in the world we like to think of the internet as a global village I be sorry it be not one yet it be mainly like the United States Europe and Japan so why be United States in the u s laughter you have to scroll like seven screensful to get to it now it would be inconsistent to put United States first but it would be intelligent this one be touch on before but why in God name do you shut down a Windows pc by click a button call start laughter here be another pet one of mine you have a printer most of the time you want to print one copy of you document in page order on that printer so why in God name do you see this every time you print it be like a 747 shuttle cockpit laughter and one of the button at the bottom you will notice be not print laughter applause now I be not say that Apple be the only company who have embrace the cult of simplicity palm be also especially in the old day wonderful about this I actually get to speak to Palm when they be fly high in the 90 and after the talk I meet one of the employee he say nice talk and I say thank you what do you do here he say I be a tap counter I be like you be a what he go well Jeff Hawkins the CEO say if any task on the Palm Pilot take more than three tap of the stylus it be too long and it have to be redesign so I be the tap counter so I be go to show you a example of a company that do not have a tap counter laughter this be Microsoft Word Ok when you want to create a new blank document in Word it could happen laughter you go up to the file menu and you choose New now what happen when you choose New do you get a new blank document you do not on the opposite side of the monitor a task bar appear and somewhere in that link by the way not at the top somewhere in that link be a button that make you a new document ok so that be a company not count tap you know I do not want to just stand here and make fun of Microsoft yes I do laughter applause the Bill Gates song piano music I have be a geek forever and I write the very first DOS I put my software and IBM together I get profit and they get the loss laughter I write the code that make the whole world run I be get royalty from everyone sometimes it be garbage but the press be snow you buy the box I will sell the code every software company be do Microsoft r d you can not keep a good idea down this day even Windows be a hack we be kind of base loosely on the Mac so it be big so it be slow you have get nowhere to go I be not do this for praise I write the code that fit the world today big mediocrity in every way we have enter planet domination mode you will have no choice you will buy my code I be Bill Gates and I write the code applause but actually I believe there be really two Microsofts there be the old one responsible for Windows and Office they be die to throw the whole thing out and start fresh but they can not they be lock in because so many add ons and other company stuff lock into the old 1982 chassis but there be also a new Microsoft that be really do good simple interface design I like the Media Center PC I like the Microsoft SPOT Watch the Wireless Watch flop miserably in the market but it be not because it be not simply and beautifully design but let put it this way would you pay 10 a month to have a watch that have to be recharge every night like you cell phone and stop work when you leave you area code laughter so the sign might indicate that the complexity crunch be only go to get bad so be there any hope the screen be get small person be illuminate put manual in the box thing be come out at a fast pace it be funny when Steve Jobs come back to Apple in 1997 after 12 year away it be the MacWorld Expo he come to the stage in that black turtleneck and jeans and he sort of do this the crowd go wild but I have just see I be like where have I see this before I have just see the movie evita laughter with Madonna and I be like you know what I have get to do one about Steve Jobs Music it will not be easy you will think I be strange laughter when I try to explain why I be back after tell the press Apple future be black you will not believe I all that you see be a kid in he teens who start out in a garage with only a buddy name woz laughter you try rhyme with garage laughter do not cry for I Cupertino laughter the truth be I never leave you I know the rope now know what the trick be I make a fortune over at Pixar laughter do not cry for I Cupertino I have still get the drive and vision I still wear sandal in any weather it be just that this day they be Gucci leather laughter applause thank you so Steve Jobs have always believe in simplicity and elegance and beauty and the truth be for year I be a little depressed because American obviously do not value it because the Mac have three percent market share Windows have 95 percent market share person do not think it be worth put a price on it so I be a little depressed and then I hear Al Gore talk and I realize I do not know the meaning of depressed laughter but it turn out I be wrong right because the iPod come out and it violate every bit of common wisdom other product cost less other product have more feature they have voice recorder and FM transmitter the other product be back by Microsoft with a open standard not Apple propriety standard but the iPod win this be the one they want the lesson be simplicity sell and there be sign that the industry be get the message this be a little company that be do very well with simplicity and elegance the Sonos thing it be catch on I have get just a couple example physically a really cool elegant thinking come along lately when you have a digital camera how do you get the picture back to you computer well you either haul around a usb cable or you buy a card reader and haul that around either one you be go to lose what I do be I take out the memory card and I fold it in half reveal usb contact I just stick it in the computer offload the picture put it right back in the camera I never have to lose anything here be another example Chris you be the source of all power will you be my power plug Chris Anderson oh yeah DP hold that and do not let go you might have see this this be Apple new laptop this the power cord it hook on like this and I be sure every one of you have do this at some point in you life or one of you child you walk along and I be about to pull this onto the floor I do not care it be a loaner here we go whoa it be magnetic it do not pull the laptop onto the floor applause in my very last example I do a lot of my work use speech recognition software and I will just you have to be kind of quiet because the software be nervous Speech recognition software be really great for do email very quickly period like I get hundred of they a day period and it be not just what I dictate that it write down period I also use this feature call voice macro period correct dissuade not just ok this be not a ideal situation because it be get the echo from the hall and stuff the point be I can respond to person very quickly by say a short word and have it write out a much long thing so if somebody send I a fan letter I will say thanks for that thank you so much for take the time to write laughter applause and conversely if somebody send I hate mail which happen daily I say piss off laughter I admire you frankness laughter applause so that be my dirty little secret do not tell anyone laughter so the point be this be a really interesting story this be version eight of this software and do you know what they put in version eight no new feature it be never happen before in software the company put no new feature they just say we will make this software work right right because for year person have buy this software try it out 95 percent accuracy be all they get which mean one in 20 word be wrong and they would put it in they drawer and the company get sick of that so they say this version we be not go to do anything but make sure it be darn accurate and so that be what they do this cult of do thing right be start to spread so my final advice for that of you who be consumer of this technology remember if it do not work it be not necessarily you ok it could be the design of the thing you be use be aware in life of good design and bad design and if you be among the person who create this stuff Easy be hard pre sweat the detail for you audience count the tap remember the hard part be not decide what feature to add it be decide what to leave out and good of all you motivation be simplicity sell CA Bravo DP thank you very much ca hear hear applause
