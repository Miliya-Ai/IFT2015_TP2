Chris Anderson let now see the extraordinary speech that we capture a couple week ago Music Jose Antonio Abreu my dear friend lady and gentleman I be overjoyed today at be award the TED Prize on behalf of all the distinguished music teacher artist and educator from Venezuela who have selflessly and loyally accompany I for 35 year in found grow and develop in Venezuela the National System of Youth and Children Orchestras and Choirs since I be a boy in my early childhood I always want to be a musician and thank God I make it from my teacher my family and my community I have all the necessary support to become a musician all my life I have dream that all Venezuelan child have the same opportunity that I have from that desire and from my heart stem the idea to make music a deep and global reality for my country from the very first rehearsal I see the bright future ahead because the rehearsal mean a great challenge to I I have receive a donation of 50 music stand to be use by 100 boy in that rehearsal when I arrive at the rehearsal only 11 kid have show up and I say to myself do I close the program or multiply this kid I decide to face the challenge and on that same night I promise that 11 child I would turn we orchestra into one of the lead orchestra in the world two month ago I remember that promise I make when a distinguished English critic publish a article in the London Times ask who could be the winner of the Orchestra World Cup he mention four great world orchestra and the fifth one be Venezuela Youth Symphony Orchestra today we can say that art in Latin America be no long a monopoly of elite and that it have become a social right a right for all the person child there be no difference here between class nor white or black nor if you have money or not simply if you be talented if you have the vocation and the will to be here you get in you share with we and make music JA during the recent tour by the Simon bolivar youth Orchestra of Venezuela of U S and Europe we see how we music move young audience to the bottom of they soul how child and adolescent rush up to the stage to receive the jacket from we musician how the stand ovation sometimes 30 minute long seem to last forever and how the public after the concert be over go out into the street to greet we young person in triumph this mean not only a artistic triumph but also a profound emotional sympathy between the public of the most advanced nation of the world and the musical youth of Latin America as see in Venezuela give this audience a message of music vitality energy enthusiasm and strength in its essence the orchestra and the choir be much more than artistic structure they be example and school of social life because to sing and to play together mean to intimately coexist toward perfection and excellence follow a strict discipline of organization and coordination in order to seek the harmonic interdependence of voice and instrument that be how they build a spirit of solidarity and fraternity among they develop they self esteem and foster the ethical and aesthetical value relate to the music in all its sens this be why music be immensely important in the awakening of sensibility in the forge of value and in the training of youngster to teach other kid child after all this time here music be life nothing else music be life JA each teenager and child in El Sistema have he own story and they be all important and of great significance to I let I mention the case of Edicson Ruiz he be a boy from a parish in Caracas who passionately attend to he double bass lesson at the San Agustin Junior Orchestra with he effort and the support of he mother he family and he community he become a principal member in the double bass segment of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra we have another well know case Gustavo Dudamel he start as a boy member of the child orchestra in he hometown Barquisimeto there he grow as a violinist and as a conductor he become the conductor of Venezuela junior orchestra and today conduct the world great orchestra he be the musical director of Los Angeles Philharmonic and be still the overall leader of Venezuela junior orchestra he be the conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra and he be a unbeatable example for young musician in Latin America and the world the structure of El Sistema be base on a new and flexible manage style adapt to the feature of each community and region and today attend to 300 000 child of the low and middle class all over Venezuela it be a program of social rescue and deep cultural transformation design for the whole Venezuelan society with absolutely no distinction whatsoever but emphasize the vulnerable and endangered social group the effect of El Sistema be feel in three fundamental circle in the personal social circle in the family circle and in the community in the personal social circle the child in the orchestra and choir develop they intellectual and emotional side the music become a source for develop the dimension of the human being thus elevate the spirit and lead man to a full development of he personality so the emotional and intellectual profit be huge the acquisition of leadership teaching and training principle the sense of commitment responsibility generosity and dedication to other and the individual contribution to achieve great collective goal all this lead to the development of self esteem and confidence Mother Teresa of Calcutta insist on something that always impress I the most miserable and tragic thing about poverty be not the lack of bread or roof but the feeling of be no one the feeling of not be anyone the lack of identification the lack of public esteem that be why the child development in the orchestra and the choir provide he with a noble identity and make he a role model for he family and community it make he a good student at school because it inspire in he a sense of responsibility perseverance and punctuality that will greatly help he at school within the family the parent support be unconditional the child become a role model for both he parent and this be very important for a poor child once the child discover he be important to he family he begin to seek new way of improve himself and hope good for himself and he community also he hope for social and economic improvement for he own family all this make up a constructive and ascend social dynamic the large majority of we child belong as I already mention to the most vulnerable strata of the Venezuelan population that encourage they to embrace new dream new goal and progress in the various opportunity that music have to offer finally in the circle of the community the orchestra prove to be the creative space of culture and source of exchange and new meaning the spontaneity music have exclude it as a luxury item and make it a patrimony of society it be what make a child play a violin at home while he father work in he carpentry it be what make a little girl play the clarinet at home while she mother do the housework the idea be that the family join with pride and joy in the activity of the orchestra and the choir that they child belong to the huge spiritual world that music produce in itself which also lie within itself end up overcome material poverty from the minute a child teach how to play a instrument he be no longer poor he become a child in progress head for a professional level who will later become a full citizen needless to say that music be the number one prevention against prostitution violence bad habit and everything degrading in the life of a child a few year ago historian Arnold Toynbee say that the world be suffer a huge spiritual crisis not a economic or social crisis but a spiritual one I believe that to confront such a crisis only art and religion can give proper answer to humanity to mankind deep aspiration and to the historic demand of we time Education the synthesis of wisdom and knowledge be the means to strive for a more perfect more aware more noble and more just society with passion and enthusiasm we pay profound respects to TED for its outstanding humanism the scope of its principle for its open and generous promotion of young value we hope that TED can contribute in a full and fundamental way to the building of this new era in the teaching of music in which the social communal spiritual and vindicatory aim of the child and the adolescent become a beacon and a goal for a vast social mission no long put society at the service of art and much less at the service of monopoly of the elite but instead art at the service of society at the service of the weak at the service of the child at the service of the sick at the service of the vulnerable and at the service of all that who cry for vindication through the spirit of they human condition and the raise up of they dignity music applause ca we be go live now to Caracas we be go live to Caracas to hear
