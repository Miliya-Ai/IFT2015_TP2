I do not know about you but I have not quite figure out exactly what technology mean in my life I have spend the past year think about what it really should be about should I be pro technology should I embrace it full arm should I be wary like you I be very tempt by the late thing but at the other hand a couple of year ago I give up all of my possession sell all my technology except for a bicycle and ride across 3 000 mile on the U S back road under the power of my one body fuel mostly by Twinkies and junk food laughter and I have since then try to keep technology at arm length in many way so it do not master my life at the same time I run a website on cool tool where I issue a daily obsession of the late thing in technology so I be still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology be as it relate to humanity as it relate to nature as it relate to the spiritual and I be not even sure we know what technology be and one definition of technology be that which be first record this be the first example of the modern use of technology that I can find it be the suggest syllabus for deal with the Applied Arts and Science at Cambridge University in 1829 before that obviously technology do not exist but obviously it do I like one of the definition that Alan Kay have for technology he say technology be anything that be invent after you be bear laughter so it sum up a lot of what we be talk about Danny Hillis actually have a update on that he say technology be anything that do not quite work yet laughter which also I think get into a little bit of we current idea but I be interested in another definition of technology something again that go back to something more fundamental something that be deep and as I struggle to understand that I come up with a way of frame the question that seem to work for I in my investigation and I be this morning go to talk about this for the first time so this be a very rough attempt to think out loud the question that I come up with be this question what do technology want and by that I do not mean do it want chocolate or vanilla by what it want I mean what be its inherent trend and bias what be its tendency over time one way to think about this be think about biological organism which we have hear a lot about and the trick that Richard Dawkins do which be to say to look at they as simply as gene as vehicle for gene so he be say what do gene want the selfish gene and I be apply a similar trick to say what if we look at the universe in we culture through the eye of technology what do technology want obviously this in a incomplete question just as look at a organism as only a gene be a incomplete way of look at it but it be still very very productive so I be attempt to say if we take technology view of the world what do it want and I think once we ask that question we have to go back actually to life because obviously if we keep extend the origin of technology far back I think we come back to life at some point so that be where I want to begin my little exploration be in life and like you hear from the previous speaker we do not really know what life there be on Earth right now we have really no idea Craig Venter tremendous and brilliant attempt to dna sequence thing in the ocean be great Brian Farrell work be all part of this agenda to try and actually discover all the species on Earth and one of the thing that we should do be just make a grid of the globe and randomly go and inspect all the place that the grid intersect just to see what be on life and if we do that with we little Martian probe which we have not do on Earth we would begin to see some incredible species this be not on another planet this be thing that be hide away on we planet this be a ant that store its colleague honey in its abdomen each one of this organism that we have describe that you have see from Jamie and other this magnificent thing what they be do each one of they be they be hack the rule of life I can not think of a single general principle of biology that do not have a exception somewhere by some organism every single thing that we can think of and if you hear Olivia talk about the sexual habit you will realize that there be not anything we can say that be true for all life because every single one of they be hack something about it this be a solar powered sea slug it be a nudibranch that have incorporate chloroplast inside it to drive its energy this be another version of that this be a sea dragon and the one on the bottom the blue one be a juvenile that have not yet swallow the acid have not yet take in the brown green algae pond scum into its body to give it energy this be hack and if we look at the general shape of the approach to hack life there be current consensus six kingdom six different broad approach the plant the animal the fungus the protest the little thing the bacterium and the Archaea bacterium the Archaeas that be the general approach to life that be one way to look at life on Earth today but a more interesting way the current way to take the long view be to look at it in a evolutionary perspective and here we have a view of evolution where rather than have evolution go over the linear time we have it come out from the center so in the center be the most primitive and this be a genealogical chart of all life on earth this be all the same six kingdom you see 4 000 representative species and you can see where we be but what I like about this be it show that every living organism on Earth today be equally evolve that fungus and bacterium be as highly evolve as human they have be around just as long and go through just the same kind of trial and error to get here but we see that each one of this be actually hack and have a different way of find out how to do life and if we take the long term trend of life if we begin to say what do evolution want there be several thing that we see one of the thing about evolution be that nowhere on Earth have we ever be where we do not find life we find life at the bottom of every long term long distance drilling core into the center of rock that we bring up and there be bacterium in the pore of that rock and wherever life be it never retreat it be ubiquitous and it want to be more more and more of the inert matter of the globe be be touch and animate by life the second thing be be we see diversity we also see specialization we see the movement from a general purpose cell to the more specific and specialized and we see a drift towards complexity that be very intuitive and actually we have current datum that do show that there be a actual drift towards complexity over time and the last thing I bring back this nudibranch one of the thing we see about life be that it move from the inner to increase sociability and by that it mean that there be more and more of life whose entire environment be other life like that chloroplast cell they be completely surround by other life they never touch the inner matter there be more and more co evolution and so the general long term trend of evolution be roughly this five ubiquity diversity specialization complexity and socialization now I take that and say ok what be the long term trend in technology and again my question be what do technology want and so remarkably I discover that there be also a drift toward specialization that we see there be a general hammer and hammer become more and more specific over time there be obviously diversity huge number of thing this be all the contents of a Japanese home I actually have my daughter give she a tally counter and I give she a assignment last summer to go around and count the number of species of technology in we household and it come up with 6 000 different species of product I do some research and find out that the King of England Henry VIII have only about 7 000 item in he household and he be the King of England and that be the entire wealth of England at the time so we be see huge number of diversity in the kind of thing this be a scene from Star Wars where the 3po come out and he see machine make machine how depraved well this be actually what we be head towards world machine and the technology be only be throw out by other technology most machine will only ever be in contact with other technology and not non technology or even life and thirdly the idea that machine be become biological and complex be at this point a cliche and I be happy to say I be partly responsible for that cliche that machine be become biological but that be pretty evident so the major trend in technology evolution actually be the same as in biological evolution the same drive that we see towards ubiquity towards diversity towards socialization towards complexity that be maybe not a big surprise because if we map out say the evolution of armor you can actually follow a sort of a evolutionary type cladistic tree I suggest that in fact technology be the seventh kingdom of life that its operation and how it work be so similar that we can think of it as the seventh kingdom and so it would be sort of approximately up there come out of the animal kingdom and if we be to do that we would find out we could actually approach technology in this way this be Niles Eldredge he be the co developer with Stephen Jay Gould of the theory of punctuate equilibrium but as a sideline he happen to collect cornet he have one of the world large collection about 500 of they and he have decide to treat they as if they be trilobite or snail and to do a morphological analysis and try to derive they genealogical history over time this be he chart which be not quite publish yet but the most interesting aspect about this be that if you look at that red line at the bottom that indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet that be no long make that do not happen in biology when something be extinct you can not have it as you parent but that do happen in technology and it turn out that that be so distinctive that you can actually look at this tree and you can actually use it to determine that this be a technological system versus a biological system in fact this idea of resurrect the whole idea be so important that I begin to think about what happen with old technology and it turn out that in fact technology do not die so I suggest this to a historian of science and he say well what about you know come on what about steam car they be not around anymore well actually they be in fact they be so around that you can buy new part for a Stanley steam automobile and this be a website of a guy who be sell brand new part for the Stanley automobile and the thing that I like be sort of this one click add to you cart button laughter for buy steam valve I mean it be just it be really there and so I begin to think about well maybe that be just a random sample maybe I should do this sort of in a more conservative way so I take the great big 1895 Montgomery Ward catalog and I randomly go through it and I take a page not quite a random page I take a page that be actually more difficult than other because lot of the page be fill with thing that be still be make but I take this page and I say how many of this thing be still be make and not antique I want to know how many of this thing be still in production and the answer be all of they all of they be still be produce so you have get corn sheller I do not know who need a corn sheller be it corn sheller you have get plough you have get fan mill all this thing and this be not again antique this be you can order this you can go to the web and you can buy they now brand new make so in a certain sense technology do not die in fact you can buy for 50 buck a stone age knife make exactly the same way that they be make 10 000 year ago it be short bone handle 50 buck and in fact what be important be that this information actually never die out it be not just that it be resurrect it be continue all along and in Papua New Guinea they be make stone axis until two decade ago just as a course of practical matter even when we try to get rid of a technology it be actually very hard so we have all hear about the amish give up car we have hear about the Japanese give up gun we have hear about this and that but I actually go back and take what I could find the example in history where there have be prohibition against technology and then I try to find out when they come back in because they always come back in and it turn out that the time the duration of when they be outlaw and prohibit be decrease over time and that basically you can delay technology but you can not kill it so this make sense because in a certain sense what culture be be the accumulation of idea that be what it be for it be so that idea do not die out and when we take that we take this idea of what culture be do and add it to what the long term trajectory again in life evolution we find that each case each of the major transition in life what they be really about be accelerate and change the way in which evolution happen they be actually change the way in which idea be generate so all this step in evolution be increase basically the evolution of evolvability so what be happen over time in life be that the way in which you generate this new idea this new hack be increase and the real trick be way in which you kind of explore the way of explore and then what we see in the singularity that prophesize by Kurzweil and other he idea that technology be accelerate evolution it be accelerate the way in which we search for idea so if you have life hack life mean hack the game of survival then evolution be a way to extend the game by change the rule of the game and what technology be really about be good way to evolve that be what we call a infinite game that be the definition of infinite game a finite game be play to win and a infinite game be play to keep play and I believe that technology be actually a cosmic force the origin of technology be not in 1829 but be actually at the beginning of the Big Bang and at that moment the entire huge billion of star in the universe be compress the entire universe be compress into a little quantum dot and it be so tight in there there be no room for any difference at all that be the definition there be no temperature there be no difference whatsoever and at the Big Bang what it expand be the potential for difference so as it expand and as thing expand what we have be the potential for difference diversity option choice opportunity possibility and freedom that be all basically the same thing and that be the thing that technology bring we that be what technology be bring we choice possibility freedom that be what it be about it be this expansion of room to make difference and so a hammer when we grab a hammer that be what we be grab and that be why we continue to grab technology because we want that thing that thing be good difference freedom choice possibility and each time we make a new opportunity place we be allow a platform to make new one and I think it be really important because if you can imagine Mozart before the technology of the piano be invent what a loss to society there would be imagine Van Gogh be bear before the technology of cheap oil paint imagine Hitchcock before the technology of film somewhere today there be million of young child be bear whose technology of self expression have not yet be invent we have a moral obligation to invent technology so that every person on the globe have the potential to realize they true difference we want a trillion zillion species of one individual that be what technology really want I be go to skip through some of the objection because I do not have answer to why there be deforestation I do not have a answer to the fact that there seem to be bad technology I do not have a answer to how this impact on we dignity other than to suggest that maybe the seventh kingdom because it be so close to what life be about maybe we can bring it back and have it help we monitor life maybe in some way the fact that what we be try to do with technology be find a good home for it it be a terrible thing to spray ddt on cotton field but it be a really good thing to use to eliminate million of case of death due to malaria in a small village we humanity be actually define by technology all the thing that we think that we really like about humanity be be drive by technology this be the infinite game that be what we be talk about you see technology be a way to evolve the evolution it be a way to explore possibility and opportunity and create more and it be actually a way of play the game of play all the game that be what technology want and so when I think about what technology want I think that it have to do with the fact that every person here and I really believe this every person here have a assignment and you assignment be to spend you life discover what you assignment be that recursive nature be the infinite game and if you play that well you will have other person involve so even that game extend and continue even when you be go that be the infinite game and what technology be be the medium in which we play that infinite game and so I think that we should embrace technology because it be a essential part of we journey in find out who we be thank you applause
