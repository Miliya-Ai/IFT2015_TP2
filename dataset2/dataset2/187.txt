music applause thank you Ooh I be like Phew phew calm down get back into my body now laughter usually when I play out the first thing that happen be person scream out what be she do I will play at this rock show be on stage stand completely still and they be like what be she do what be she do and then I will kind of be like Vvvwow and then they be like whoa laughter I be sure you be try to figure out well how do this thing work well what I be do be control the pitch with my left hand see the close I get to this antenna the high the note get Portamento and you can get it really low and with this hand I be control the volume so the further away my right hand get the loud it get Tones so basically with both of you hand you be control pitch and volume and kind of try to create the illusion that you be do separate note when really it be continuously go flourish beep laughter sometimes I startle myself I will forget that I have it on and I will lean over to pick up something and then it go like Blip Oh and it be like a funny sound effect that follow you around if you do not turn the thing off laughter maybe we will go into the next tune because I totally lose where this be go we be go to do a song by David Mash call listen the word be go and maybe I will have word come back into I afterwards if I can relax music applause so I be try to think of some of the question that be commonly ask there be so many and well I guess I could tell you a little of the history of the theremin it be invent around the 1920 and the inventor l on Theremin he also be a musician besides a inventor he come up with the idea for make the theremin I think when he be work on some shortwave radio and there would be that sound in the signal it be like screech and he think oh what if I could control that sound and turn it into a instrument because there be pitch in it and so somehow through develop that he eventually come to make the theremin the way it be now and a lot of time even kid nowadays they will make reference to a theremin by go Whoo hoo hoo hoo because in the 50 it be use in the sci fi horror movie that sound that be like Woo hoo hoo hoo laughter it be kind of a funny goofy sound to do and sometimes if I have too much coffee then my vibrato get out of hand you be really sensitive to you body and its function when you be behind this thing you have to stay so still if you want to have the most control it remind I of the balancing act early on what Michael be do because you be fight so hard to keep the balance with what you be play with and stay in tune and at the same time you do not want to focus so much on be in tune all the time you want to be feel the music and then also you be try to stay very very very still because little movement with other part of you body will affect the pitch or sometimes if you be hold a low note Tone rise out of key and breathing will make it laughter if I pass out on the next song laughter I think of it almost like like a yoga instrument because it make you so aware of every little crazy thing you body be do or just aware of what you do not want it to be do while you be play you do not want to have any sudden movement and if I go to a club and play a gig person be like here have some drink on we and it be like well I be about to go on soon I do not want to be like teeter tone you know it really do reflect the mood that you be in also if you be it be similar to be a vocalist except instead of it come out of you throat you be control it just in the air and you do not really have a point of reference you be always rely on you ear and adjust constantly you just have to always adjust to what be happen and realize you will have bummer note come here and there and listen to it adjust it and just move on or else you will get too tie up and go crazy like I I think we will play another tune now I be go to do lush life it be one of my favorite tune to play music applause
