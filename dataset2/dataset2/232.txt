so I be in Chile in the Atacama desert sit in a hotel lobby because that be the only place that I can get a Wi Fi connection and I have this picture up on my screen and a woman come up behind I she say oh that be beautiful what be it be that Jackson Pollock and unfortunately I can be a little too honest I say no it be it be penguin shit laughter and you know excuse I and I could sense that she think I be speak synecdochically laughter so I say no no really it be penguin shit laughter because I have just be in the Falkland Islands take picture of penguin this be a Gentoo penguin and she be still skeptical so literally a few minute before that I download this scientific paper about calculation on avian defecation which be really quite interesting because it turn out you can model this as something call poiseuille flow and you can learn a awful lot about the physics of the avian rectum actually technically it be not a rectum it be call a cloaca at this point she stop I and she say who be you Wha what do you do and I be stick because I do not have any way to describe what I do and so in some sense this talk today be my answer to that it be a selection of a random bunch of the stuff that I do and it be very hard for I to make sense of it so I be not sure that you can it be the kind of thing that I sit up late at night think about sometimes often at four in the morning so some person be afraid of what I do some person think I be the nerd Tony Soprano and in response I have order a bulletproof pocket protector I be not sure what this person think because I do not speak Norsk laughter but I be not think monsteret be a good thing I do not know you know so one of the thing that I love to do be travel around the world and look at archaeological site because archaeology give we a opportunity to study past civilization and see where they succeed and where they fail Use science to you know work backwards and say well really what be they think and recently I be in Easter Island which be a incredibly beautiful place and a incredibly mysterious place because no matter where you go in Easter Island you be strike by this statue call the moai the place be 64 square mile they make so far as we can tell 900 of they why on Earth and if you have not read Jared Diamond book collapse I totally recommend that you do he be get a great chapter about it basically this person commit ecological suicide in order to make more of this and somewhere along the line somebody say I know let cut down the last tree and commit suicide because we need more identical statue laughter and one thing that be not a mystery actually be when I grow up because when I be a little kid I have see this picture and I think well why that look on the face why that brow I mean it be such a powerful thing where do they get that inspiration and then I meet Yoyo who be the native Rapa Nui a guide and if you look at Yoyo face you kind of figure out where they get it there be many mystery this statue everyone want to know how do they make they how do they transport they this woman in the foreground be Jo Anne Van Tilberg she be the lead archaeologist work Easter Island today and she have study the statue for 20 some year and she have detail record of every single statue the one on the page here be the same that be up there one interesting problem be the stone be not very hard so this use to be completely smooth in fact in many of the statue when you excavate they the back be totally smooth almost glass smooth but after 1 000 year out in the weather they look like this Jo Anne and I have just embark on a project to digitize they all and we be go to do a very high re digitization first because it be a way of preserve they second we have this idea about how you can algorithmically then learn a few of the mystery about they how long have they be stand in what position and maybe indirectly get at some of the issue of what cause they to be the way they be while I be in Easter Island comet McNaught be there also so you get a gratuitous picture of a moai with a comet I also have a archaeological project go on in Egypt go on be perhaps a little bit strong we be try to get all of the permission to get everything all set to get it go so I will talk about it at a future TED but there be some amazing opportunity in Egypt as well another thing I do be I invent stuff in fact I design nuclear reactor not a joke this be the conventional nuclear fuel cycle the red line be what be do in most nuclear reactor it be call the open fuel cycle the white line be what be call a advance fuel cycle where you reprocess now this be the normal way it be do it be get the huge advantage that it do not create carbon pollution it have a lot of disadvantage each one of this step be extremely expensive it be potentially dangerous and they have the interesting property that the step can not be perform in anyone backyard which be a problem so we reactor eliminate this step which if we can actually make it work be a really cool thing now it be kind of nuts to work on a new nuclear reactor there be no reactor be even build to a old design much less a new one in the United States for 25 year it be the kind of very high risk but potentially very high return thing that we do change into a totally different field we do a lot of stuff in solid state physics particularly in a area call metamaterial a metamaterial be a artificial material which manipulate in this case electromagnetic radiation in a way that you could not otherwise so this device here be a invisibility cloak it may not seem that but if you be a microwave this be how you would view it Rays of light in this case microwave light come in and they just squish around the cell and they come back the other side now you could do that with mirror from one angle the cool thing be this do it from all angle Metamaterials unfortunately a it only work on microwave and b it do not work all that well yet but metamaterial be a incredibly exciting field it be you know today I would like to say it be a zero billion dollar business but in fact it be negative but some day some day maybe it be go to work we do a lot of work in biomedical field in this case we be work with a major medical foundation to develop inexpensive way of diagnose disease in develop country so they say the eye be the window of the soul turn out they be a window to a whole lot more stuff and this happen to be my eye by the way now I be also very interested in cook while I be at Microsoft I take a leave of absence and go to a chef school in France I use to work also while at Microsoft at a lead restaurant in Seattle so I do a lot of cooking I have be on a team that win the world championship of barbecue but barbecue interesting because it be one of this cult food like chili or bouillabaisse various part of the world will have a cult food that person get enormously attach to there be tremendous tradition there be secrecy and I be try to use a very scientific approach so this be my late cooker and if this look more complicated than the nuclear reactor that be because it be but if you get to play with all that knob and dial and of course really the controller over there do it all on software you can make some terrific rib laughter this be a high speed centrifuge you should all have one in you kitchen beside you Turbochef this subject food to a force about 50 000 time that of normal gravity and oh boy do it clarify chicken stock you would not believe it I perform a series of ghoulish experiment on food in this case try to calibrate a mathematical model so that one can predict exactly what the internal cooking time be it turn out a it be useful and for a geek like I it be fun theory be red black be experiment so I be either really good at fake it or this particular model seem to work so another random thing I do be the search for extraterrestrial intelligence or seti and you may be familiar with the movie contact which sort of popularize that it turn out there be real person who go out and search for extraterrestrial in a very scientific way in fact almost everybody in the movie be base on a real character a real person so the Jodie Foster character here be actually this woman Jill Tarter and Jill have dedicate she life to this you know a lot of person risk they life in a brief act of heroism which be kind of cool but Jill have what I call slow heroism she be risk she professional life on something that she own calculation show may not work for a thousand year may not ever so I like to support person that be risk they life after the movie come out of course there be a lot of interest in SETI my kid see the movie and afterwards they come to I and they say so Dad so so that character that be Jill right I say oh yeah yeah absolutely and that other person that be someone I say yes they say well you know that creepy rich guy in the movie be that you I say well you know it be just a movie come on laughter so the SETI Institute with a little bit of help from I and a lot of help from Paul Allen and a variety of other person be build a dedicated radio telescope in Hat Creek California so they can do this seti work now I travel a lot and I change cell phone a lot and the one person who always get update on all my cell phone and pager and everything else be Jill because I really do not want to miss the call laughter I mean can you imagine e t phone home and I be not like there you know horrible so I do a lot of work on dinosaur I be know to tedster as the guy that have sex with dinosaur and I resemble that remark I be go to talk about a different aspect of dinosaur which be the finding of they now to find dinosaur you hike around in horrible condition look for a dinosaur it sound really dumb but that be what it be it be horrible condition because wherever you have nice weather plant grow and you do not get any erosion and you do not see any dinosaur so you always find dinosaur in desert or badland area that have very little plant growth and have flash flood in the spring you know skier pray for snow paleontologist pray for erosion so you hike around and this be after you dig they up they look like this you hike around you see something like this now this be something I find so look at it very closely here you have get this bentonite clay which be sort of swell up and expand and there be some stuff poke out so you look at that and you look up close and you say well gee that be kind of interesting what be all of this piece well if you look closely you can recognize actually from the shape that this be skull fragment and then when you look at this you say that be a tooth it be a big tooth it be about the size of a banana it have a big serration on the edge this be what Tyrannosaurus rex look like in the ground and this be what it be like to find a Tyrannosaurus rex which I be lucky enough to do a few year ago now this be what Tyrannosaurus rex look like in my living room not the same one actually this be a cast which I have buy and then after buy the cast I find my own and I do not have room for two you know so the thing that be wonderful for I about find dinosaur be that it be both a intellectual thing because you be try to reconstruct the environment of million of year ago it be something that can inform all sort of science in unexpected way the study of dinosaur lead to the realization that there be a problem with asteroid impact for example the study of dinosaur may literally one day save the planet study of the ancient climate be very important in fact the Mesozoic when dinosaur live have much high co2 than today be much warm than today and be one of the interesting proof point for the effect of co2 on climate but besides be intellectually and scientifically interesting it be also very different than the other thing I do because you get to hike around in the badland this be actually what most dinosaur research look like this be one of my paper a pygostyle from a non avian theropod it be not as grip as dinosaur sex so we be not go to go into it further now I be also really big on photography I travel all over the world take picture some of they good most of they not this day bit be cheap unfortunately that mean you have get to spend more time sort through they here be a picture I take in the Falkland Islands of king penguin on a beach here be a picture I take in Alaska a few year ago of Orcas I have go up to photograph Orcas and we have look for a week and we have not see a damn Orca and the last day the sun come out the Orcas come they be right by the boat it be fantastic and I get lot of picture like this then a little bit late I start get some picture like this now to a human audience I need to explain that if Penthouse magazine have a marine mammal edition this would be the centerfold it be true so there be more and more activity near the boat and all of a sudden somebody shout what be that in the water I say well I think that be what you call a free willy laughter there be a variety of thing you can learn from watch whale have sex laughter the first thing you learn be the overwhelming importance of hand they do not have they laughter I think Paul Simon be in the audience and he have he may not realize it but he write a song all about whale sex slip slidin away that be kind of what it be like the other interesting thing that I learn about whale sex they curl they toe too laughter so where do you go put all of this disparate piece together you know there be a tremendous amount of wisdom in find a great thing passion in life and focus all you energy on it and I have never be able to do that I just you know because yes I will focus passion on something but then there will be something else and then there be something else again and for a long time I fight this and I think well gee I really ought to buckle down and you know when I be at Microsoft that be so engrossing and the whole industry be expand so much that it do tend to crowd out most of the other thing in my life but ultimately I decide that what I really ought to do be not fight be who I be but embrace it and say yeah you know I this whole talk have be a mile wide and a inch deep but that be really what work for I and regardless of whether it be nuclear reactor or metamaterial or whale sex the common or low common denominator be I that be it thank you applause
