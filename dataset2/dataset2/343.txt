in 1962 Buckminster Fuller present the particularly audacious proposal for the Geoscope it be a 200 foot diameter geodesic sphere to be suspend over the East River in New York City in full view of the United Nations it be a big idea for sure and it be one that he feel could truly inform and deeply affect the decision making of this body through animation of global datum trend and other information regard the globe on this sphere and today 45 year later we clearly have no less need for this kind of clarity and perspective but what we do have be improve technology today we do not need one million light bulb to create a spherical display we can use led led be small they be cheap they be long last they be more efficient most importantly for this they be fast and this speed combine with today high performance micro controller allow we to actually simulate in this piece over 17 000 led use just 64 and the way this happen be through the phenomenon of persistence of vision but as this ring rotate at about 1 700 rpm that be 28 time per second the equator speed be actually about 60 mile per hour there be four on board micro controller that each time this ring rotate it as it pass the rear of the display it pick up a position signal and from that the on board micro controller can extrapolate the position of the ring at all point around the revolution and display arbitrary bitmap image and animation but this be really just the beginning in addition to high resolution version of this display my father and I be work on a new patent pend design for a fully volumetric display use the same phenomenon it achieve this by rotate led about two axis so as you can see here this be a eleven inch diameter circuit board this block represent led and so you could see that as this disc rotate about this axis it will create a disc of light that we can control that be nothing new that be a propeller clock that be the rim that you can buy for you car but what be new be that when we rotate this disc about this axis this disc of light actually become a sphere of light and so we can control that with micro controller and create a fully volumetric three dimensional display with just 256 led now this piece be currently in process due out in May but what we have do be we have put together a small demo just to show the geometric translation of point into a sphere I have get a little video to show you but keep in mind that this be with no electronic control and this be also with only four led this be actually only about 1 5 percent of what the final display will be in May so take a look and here you can see it be rotate about the vertical axis only create circle and then as the other axis kick in that actually blur into a volume and the shutter speed of the camera actually make it slightly less effective in this case but this piece be due out in May it will be on display at the interactive Telecommunications Spring Show in Greenwich Village in New York City that be open to the public definitely invite you all to come and attend it be a fantastic show there be hundred of student innovator with fantastic project this piece actually will be on display down in the Sierra Simulcast Lounge in the break between now and the end of the show so I would love to talk to you all and invite you to come down and take a close look it be a honor to be here thanks very much applause
