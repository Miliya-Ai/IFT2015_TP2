I be go to present three project in rapid fire I do not have much time to do it and I want to reinforce three idea with that rapid fire presentation the first be what I like to call a hyper rational process it be a process that take rationality almost to a absurd level and it transcend all the baggage that normally come with what person would call sort of a rational conclusion to something and it conclude in something that you see here that you actually would not expect as be the result of rationality the second the second be that this process do not have a signature there be no authorship architect be obsess with authorship this be something that have editing and it have team but in fact we no long see within this process the traditional master architect create a sketch that he minion carry out and the third be that it challenge and this be in the length of this very hard to support why connect all this thing but it challenge the high modernist notion of flexibility high modernist say we will create sort of singular space that be generic almost anything can happen within they I call it sort of shotgun flexibility turn you head this way shoot and you be bind to kill something so this be the promise of high modernism within a single space actually any kind of activity can happen but as we be see operational cost be start to dwarf capital cost in term of design parameter and so with this sort of idea what happen be whatever actually be in the building on open day or whatever seem to be the most immediate need start to dwarf the possibility and sort of subsume it of anything else could ever happen and so we be propose a different kind of flexibility something that we call compartmentalized flexibility and the idea be that you within that continuum identify a series of point and you design specifically to they they can be push off center a little bit but in the end you actually still get as much of that original spectrum as you originally have hope with high modernist flexibility that do not really work now I be go to talk about I be go to build up the Seattle Central Library in this way before you eye in about five or six diagram and I truly mean this be the design process that you will see with the library staff and the library board we settle on two core position this be the first one and this be show over the last 900 year the evolution of the book and other technology this diagram be we sort of position piece about the book and we position be book be technology that be something person forget but it be a form of technology that will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent technology or media the second premise and this be something that be very difficult for we to convince the librarian of at first be that library since the inception of Carnegie Library tradition in America have a second responsibility and that be for social role ok now this I will come back to later but something actually the librarian at first say no this be not we mandate we mandate be media and particularly the book so what you be see now be actually the design of the build the upper diagram be what we have see in a whole host of contemporary library that use high modernist flexibility sort of any activity could happen anywhere we do not know the future of the library we do not know the future of the book and so we will use this approach and what we see be build that be very generic and bad not only be they very generic so not only do the reading room look like the copy room look like the magazine area but it mean that whatever issue be trouble the library at that moment be start to engulf every other activity that be happen in it and in this case what be get engulf be this social responsibility by the expansion of the book and so we propose what be at the low diagram very dumb approach simply compartmentalize put that thing whose evolution we could predict and I do not mean that we could say what would actually happen in the future but we have some certainty of the spectrum of what would happen in the future put that in box design specifically for it and put the thing that we can not predict on the rooftop so that be the core idea now we have to convince the library that social role be equally important to media in order to get they to accept this what you be see here be actually they program on the leave that be as it be give to we in all of its clarity and glory we first operation be to be digest it back to they show it to they and say you know what we have not touch it but only one third of you own program be dedicate to media and book two third of it be already dedicate that be the white band below the thing you say be not important be already dedicate to social function so once we have present that back to they they agree that this sort of core concept could work we get the right to go back to first principle that be the third diagram we recombine everything and then we start make new decision what you be see on the right be the design of the library specifically in term of square footage on the left of that diagram here you will see a series of five platform sort of comb collective program and on the right be the more indeterminate space thing like read room whose evolution in 20 30 40 year we can not predict so that literally be the design of the building they sign it and to they chagrin we come back a week later and we present they this and as you can see it be literally the diagram on the right laughter we just size no really I mean that literally the thing on the left hand side of the diagram that be the box we size they into five compartment they be super efficient we have a very low budget to work with we push they around on the site to make very literal contextual relationship the reading room should be able to see the water the main entrance should have a public plaza in front of it to abide by the zoning code and so forth so you see the five platform that be the box within each one a very discrete thing be happen the area in between be sort of a urban continuum this thing that we can not predict they evolution to the same degree to give you some sense of the power of this idea the big block be what we call the book spiral it be literally build in a very inexpensive way it be a parking garage for book it just so happen to be on the 6th through 10th floor of the building but that be not necessarily a expensive approach and it allow we to organize the entire Dewey Decimal System on one continuous run no matter how it grow or contract within the building it will always have its clarity to end the sort of trail of tear that we have all experience in public library laughter and so this be the final operation which be to take this block as they be all push off kilter and to hold onto they with a skin that skin serve double duty again for economics one it be the lateral stability for the entire building it be a structural element but its dimension be design not only for structure but also for hold on every piece of glass the glass be then I will use the word impregnate but it have a layer of metal that be call stretch metal that metal act as a microlouver so from the exterior of the build the sun see it as totally opaque but from the interior it be entirely transparent so now I be go to take you on a tour of the building let I see if I can find it for anyone who get motion sickness I apologize so this be the building and I think what be important be when we first unveil the build the public see it as be totally about we whim and ego and it be defend believe it or not by the librarian they say look we do not know what it be but we know it be everything that we need it to be base on the observation that we have do about the program this be go into one of the entry so it be a unusual building for a public library obviously so now we be go into what we call the living room this be actually a program that we invent with the library it be recognize that public library be the last vestige of public free space there be plenty of shopping mall that allow you to get out of the rain in downtown Seattle but there be not so many free place that allow you to get out of the rain so this be a unprogrammed area where person could pretty much do anything include eat yell play chess and so forth now we be move up into what we call the mix chamber that be the main technology area in the building you will have to tell I if I be go too fast for you and now up this be actually the place that we put into the building so I could propose to my wife right there laughter she say yes laughter I be run out of time so I be actually go to stop I can show this to you later but let see if I can very quickly get into the book spiral because I think it be as I say the most this be the main reading room the most unique part of the build you dizzy yet ok so here this be the book spiral so it be very indiscernible but it be actually a continuous stair step it allow you to on one city block go up one full floor so that it be on a continuum Ok now I be go to go back and I be go to hit a second project I be go to go very very quickly through this now this be the Dallas Theater it be a unusual client for we because they come to we and they say we need you to do a new building we have be work in a temporary space for 30 year but because of that temporary space we have become a infamous theater company Theater be really focus in New York Chicago and Seattle with the exception of the Dallas Theater Company and the very fact that they work in a provisional space mean that for Beckett they could blow out a wall they could do Cherry Orchard and blow a hole through the floor and so forth so it be a very daunting task for we to do a brand new building that could be a pristine building but keep this kind of experimental nature and the second be they be what we call a multi form theater they do different kind of performance in repertory so they in the morning will do something in arena then they will do something in proscenium and so forth and so they need to be able to quickly transform between different theater organization and for operational budget reason this actually no long happen in pretty much any multi form theater in the United States so we need to figure out a way to overcome that so we think be to literally put the theater on its head to take that thing that be previously define as front of house and back of house and stack they above house and below house and to create what we call a theater machine we invest the money in the operation of the building it be almost as though the building could be place anywhere wherever you place it the area under it be charge for theatrical performance and it allow we to go back to first principle and redefine fly tower acoustic enclosure light enclosure and so forth and at the push of a button it allow the artistic director to move between proscenium thrust and in fact arena and traverse and flat floor in a very quick transfiguration so in fact use operational budget we can sorry capital cost we can actually achieve what be no long achievable in operational cost and that mean that the artistic director now have a palette that he or she can choose from between a series of form and a series of procession because that enclosure around the theater that be normally trap with front of house and back of house space have be liberate so a artistic director have the ability to have a performance that enter in a wagnerian procession show the first act in thrust the intermission in a Greek procession second act in arena and so forth so I be go to show you what this actually mean this be the theater up close any portion around the theater actually can be open discretely the light enclosure can be lift separate to the acoustic enclosure so you can do Beckett with Dallas as the backdrop portion can be open so you can now actually have motorcycle drive directly into the performance or you can even just have a open air performance or for intermission the balcony all move to go between that configuration but they also disappear the proscenium line can also disappear you can bring enormous object in so in fact the Dallas Theater Company they first show will be a play about Charles Lindbergh and they will want to bring in a real aircraft and then it also provide they in the off season the ability to actually rent out they space for entirely different thing this be it from a distance open up entire portion for different kind of event and at night again remove the light enclosure keep the acoustic enclosure this be a monster truck show I be go to show now the last project this also be a unusual client they invert the whole idea of development they come to we and they say unlike normal developer they say we want to start out by provide a contemporary art museum in Louisville that be we main goal and so instead of be a developer that see a opportunity to make money they see a ability to be a catalyst in they downtown and the fact that they want to support the contemporary art museum actually build they pro forma so they work in reverse and that pro forma lead we to a mixed use building that be very large in order to support they aspiration of the art but it also open up opportunity for the art itself to collaborate interact with commercial space that actually artist more and more want to work within and it also charge we with think about how to have something that be both a single building and a credible sort of sub building so this be Louisville skyline and I be go to take you through the various constraint that lead to the project first the physical constraint we actually have to operate on three discrete site all of they well small than the size of the building we have to operate next to the new Muhammad Ali Center and respect it we have to operate within the 100 year floodplain now this area flood three to four time a year and there be a levee behind we site similar to the one that break in New Orleans have to operate behind the I 64 corridor a street that cut through the middle of this separate site so we be start to build a sort of nightmare of constraint in a bathtub underneath the bathtub be the city main power line and there be a pedestrian corridor that they want to add that would link a series of cultural building and a view corridor because this be the historic district that they do not want to obstruct with a new building laughter and now we be go to add 1 1 million square foot and if we do the traditional thing that 1 1 million square foot this be the different program the traditional thing would be to identify the public element place they on site and now we would have a really terrible situation a public thing in the middle of a bathtub that flood and then we would size all the other element the different commercial element hotel luxury housing office and so forth and dump it on top and we would create something that be unviable in fact and you know this this be call the Time Warner Building laughter so we strategy be very simple just lift the entire block flip some of the element over reposition they so they have appropriate view and relationship to downtown and make circulation connection and reroute the road so that be the basic concept and now I be go to show you what it lead to ok it seem a very formal willful gesture but something derive entirely out of the constraint and again when we unveil it there be a sort of nervousness that this be about a architect make a statement not a architect who be attempt to solve a series of problem now within that center zone as I say we have the ability to mix a series of thing so here this be sort of a x ray the tower be totally developer drive they tell we the dimension the size and so forth and we focus on take all the public component the lobby the bar everything that different commercial element would have and combine it in the center in the sort of subway map in the transfer zone that would also include the contemporary art museum so it create a situation like this where you have artist who can operate within a art space that also have a amazing view on the 22nd floor but it also have proximity that the curator can either open or close it allow person on exercise bicycle to be see or to see the art and so forth it also mean that if a artist want to invade something like a swimming pool they can begin to do they exhibition in a swimming pool so they be not force to always work within the confines of a contemporary gallery space so how to build this it be very simple it be a chair so we begin by build the core as we be build the core we build the contemporary art museum at grade that allow we to have incredible efficiency and cost efficiency this be not a high budget build the moment the core get to mid level we finish the art museum we put all the mechanical equipment in it and then we jack it up into the air this be how they build really large aircraft hangar for instance the one that they do for the a380 finish the core finish the meat and you get something that look like this now I only have about 30 second so I want to start a animation and we will conclude with that thank you applause Chris ask I to add the theater be under construction and this project will start construction in about a year and finish in 2010 identify public element insert public element at grade optimize tower dimension place
