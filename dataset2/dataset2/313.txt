I think all of we have be interested at one time or another in the romantic mystery of all that society that collapse such as the classic Maya in the Yucatan the Easter Islanders the Anasazi Fertile Crescent society Angor Wat Great Zimbabwe and so on and within the last decade or two archaeologist have show we that there be environmental problem underlie many of this past collapse but there be also plenty of place in the world where society have be develop for thousand of year without any sign of a major collapse such as Japan Java Tonga and Tikopea so evidently society in some area be more fragile than in other area how can we understand what make some society more fragile than other society the problem be obviously relevant to we situation today because today as well there be some society that have already collapse such as Somalia and Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia there be also society today that may be close to collapse such as Nepal Indonesia and Columbia what about ourselves what be there that we can learn from the past that would help we avoid decline or collapse in the way that so many past society have obviously the answer to this question be not go to be a single factor if anyone tell you that there be a single factor explanation for societal collapse you know right away that they be a idiot this be a complex subject but how can we make sense out of the complexity of this subject in analyze societal collapse I have arrive at a five point framework a checklist of thing that I go through to try and understand collapse and I will illustrate that five point framework by the extinction of the Greenland norse society this be a European society with literate record so we know a good deal about the person and they motivation in ad 984 Vikings go out to Greenland settle Greenland and around 1450 they die out the society collapse and every one of they end up dead why do they all end up dead well in my five point framework the first item on the framework be to look for human impact on the environment person inadvertently destroy the resource base on which they depend and in the case of the viking norse the Vikings inadvertently cause soil erosion and deforestation which be a particular problem for they because they require forest to make charcoal to make iron so they end up a iron age European society virtually unable to make they own iron a second item on my checklist be climate change climate can get warm or cold or dryer or wet in the case of the Vikings in Greenland the climate get cold in the late 1300 and especially in the 1400 but a cold climate be not necessarily fatal because the Inuit the Eskimos inhabit Greenland at the same time do good rather than bad with cold climate so why do not the Greenland Norse as well the third thing on my checklist be relation with neighbor friendly society that may prop up a society and if that friendly support be pull away that may make a society more likely to collapse in the case of the Greenland Norse they have trade with the mother country Norway and that trade dwindle partly because Norway get weak partly because of sea ice between Greenland and Norway the fourth item on my checklist be relation with hostile society in the case of Norse Greenland the hostile be the Inuit the Eskimos share Greenland with whom the Norse get off to bad relationship and we know that the Inuit kill the Norse and probably of great importance may have block access to the outer fjord on which the Norse depend for seal at a critical time of the year and then finally the fifth item on my checklist be the political economic social and cultural factor in the society that make it more or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its environmental problem in the case of the Greenland Norse cultural factor that make it difficult for they to solve they problem be they commitment to a Christian society invest heavily in cathedral they be a competitive rank chiefly society and they scorn for the Inuit from whom they refuse to learn so that be how the five part framework be relevant to the collapse and eventual extinction of the Greenland Norse what about a society today for the past five year I have be take my wife and kid to Southwestern Montana where I work as a teenager on the hay harvest and Montana at first sight seem like the most pristine environment in the United States but scratch the surface and Montana suffer from serious problem go through the same checklist human environmental impact yes acute in Montana toxic problem from mine waste have cause damage of billion of dollar problem from weed weed control cost Montana nearly 200 million dollar a year Montana have lose agricultural area from salinization problem of forest management problem of forest fire second item on my checklist climate change yes the climate in Montana be get warm and dry but Montana agriculture depend especially on irrigation from the snow pack and as the snow be melt for example as the glacier in Glacier National Park be disappear that be bad news for Montana irrigation agriculture third thing on my checklist relation with friendly that can sustain the society in Montana today more than half of the income of Montana be not earn within Montana but be derive from out of state transfer payment from social security investment and so on which make Montana vulnerable to the rest of the United States Fourth relation with hostile Montanans have the same problem as do all American in be sensitive to problem create by hostile overseas affect we oil supply and terrorist attack and finally last item on my checklist question of how political economic social cultural attitude play into this Montanans have long hold value which today seem to be get in the way of they solve they own problem long hold devotion to log and to mine and to agriculture and to no government regulation value that work well in the past but they do not seem to be work well today so I be look at this issue of collapse for a lot of past society and for many present society be there any general conclusion that arise in a way just like Tolstoy statement about every unhappy marriage be different every collapse or endanger society be different they all have different detail but nevertheless there be certain common thread that emerge from this comparison of past society that do or do not collapse and threaten society today one interesting common thread have to do with in many case the rapidity of collapse after a society reach its peak there be many society that do not wind down gradually but they build up get rich and more powerful and then within a short time within a few decade after they peak they collapse for example the classic lowland Maya of the Yucatan begin to collapse in the early 800 literally a few decade after the Maya be build they big monument and Maya population be great or again the collapse of the Soviet Union take place within a couple of decade maybe within a decade of the time when the Soviet Union be at its great power a analogue would be the growth of bacterium in a petri dish this rapid collapse be especially likely where there be a mismatch between available resource and resource consumption or a mismatch between economic outlay and economic potential in a petri dish bacterium grow say they double every generation and five generation before the end the petri dish be 15 16th empty and then the next generation 3 4th empty and the next generation half empty within one generation after the petri dish still be half empty it be full there be no more food and the bacterium have collapse so this be a frequent theme society collapse very soon after reach they peak in power what it mean to put it mathematically be that if you be concerned about a society today you should be look not at the value of the mathematical function the wealth itself but you should be look at the first derivative and the second derivative of the function that be one general theme a second general theme be that there be many often subtle environmental factor that make some society more fragile than other many of that factor be not well understand for example why be it that in the Pacific of that hundred of Pacific island why do Easter Island end up as the most devastating case of complete deforestation it turn out that there be about nine different environmental factor some rather subtle one that be work against the Easter Islanders and they involve fallout of volcanic tephra latitude rainfall perhaps the most subtle of they be that it turn out that a major input of nutrient which protect island environment in the Pacific be from the fallout of continental dust from central Asia Easter of all Pacific island have the least input of dust from Asia restore the fertility of its soil but that be a factor that we do not even appreciate until 1999 so some society for subtle environmental reason be more fragile than other and then finally another generalization I be now teach a course at UCLA to UCLA undergraduate on this collapse of society what really bug my UCLA undergraduate student be how on earth do this society not see what they be do how could the Easter Islanders have deforest they environment what do they say when they be cut down the last palm tree do not they see what they be do how could society not perceive they impact on the environment and stop in time and I would expect that if we human civilization carry on then maybe in the next century person will be ask why on earth do this person today in the year 2003 not see the obvious thing that they be do and take corrective action it seem incredible in the past in the future it will seem incredible what we be do today and so I have be try to develop a hierarchical set of consideration about why society fail to solve they problem why they fail to perceive the problem or if they perceive they why they fail to tackle they or if they tackle they why do they fail to succeed in solve they I will just mention two generalization in this area one blueprint for trouble make collapse likely be where there be a conflict of interest between the short term interest of the decision make elite and the long term interest of the society as a whole especially if the elite be able to insulate themselves from the consequence of they action where what be good in the short run for the elite be bad for the society as a whole there be a real risk of the elite do thing that would bring the society down in the long run for example among the Greenland Norse a competitive rank society what the chief really want be more follower and more sheep and more resource to outcompete the neighboring chief and that lead the chief to do what be call flog the land overstock the land force tenant farmer into dependency and that make the chief powerful in the short run but lead to the society collapse in the long run that same issue of conflict of interest be acute in the United States today especially because the decision maker in the United States be frequently able to insulate themselves from consequence by live in gate compound by drink bottled water and so on and within the last couple of year it be be obvious that the elite in the business world correctly perceive that they can advance they short term interest by do thing that be good for they but bad for society as a whole such as drain a few billion dollar out of Enron and other business they be quite correct that this thing be good for they in the short term although bad for society in the long term so that be one general conclusion about why society make bad decision conflict of interest and the other generalization that I want to mention be that it be particularly hard for a society to make quote unquote good decision when there be a conflict involve strongly hold value that be good in many circumstance but be poor in other circumstance for example the Greenland Norse in this difficult environment be hold together for four and a half century by they share commitment to religion and by they strong social cohesion but that two thing commitment to religion and strong social cohesion also make it difficult for they to change at the end and to learn from the Inuit or today Australia one of the thing that enable Australia to survive in this remote outpost of European civilization for 250 year have be they British identity but today they commitment to a British identity be serve Australian poorly in they need to adapt to they situation in Asia so it be particularly difficult to change course when the thing that get you in trouble be the thing that be also the source of you strength what be go to be the outcome today well all of we know the dozen sort of tick time bomb go on in the modern world time bomb that have fuse of a few decade to all of they not more than 50 year and any one of which can do we in the time bomb of water of soil of climate change invasive species the photosynthetic ceiling population problem toxic etc etc list about 12 of they and while this time bomb none of they have a fuse beyond 50 year and most of they have fuse of a few decade some of they in some place have much short fuse at the rate at which we be go now the Philippines will lose all its accessible loggable forest within five year and the Solomon Islands be only one year away from lose they loggable forest which be they major export and that be go to be spectacular for the economy of the Solomons People often ask I Jared what be the most important thing that we need to do about the world environmental problem and my answer be the most important thing we need to do be to forget about there be any single thing that be the most important thing we need to do instead there be a dozen thing any one of which could do we in and we have get to get they all right because if we solve 11 we fail to solve the 12th we be in trouble for example if we solve we problem of water and soil and population but do not solve we problem of toxic then we be in trouble the fact be that we present course be a non sustainable course which mean by definition that it can not be maintain and the outcome be go to get resolve within a few decade that mean that that of we in this room who be less than 50 or 60 year old will see how this paradox be resolve and that of we who be over the age of 60 may not see the resolution but we child and grandchild certainly will the resolution be go to achieve either of two form either we will resolve this non sustainable time fuse in pleasant way of we own choice by take remedial action or else this conflict be go to get settle in unpleasant way not of we choice namely by war disease or starvation but what be for sure be that we non sustainable course will get resolve in one way or another in a few decade in other word since the theme of this session be choice we have a choice do that mean that we should get pessimistic and overwhelmed I draw the reverse conclusion the big problem face the world today be not at all thing beyond we control we big threat be not a asteroid about to crash into we something we can do nothing about instead all the major threat face we today be problem entirely of we own making and since we make the problem we can also solve the problem that then mean that it be entirely in we power to deal with this problem in particular what can all of we do for that of you who be interested in this choice there be lot of thing you can do there be a lot that we do not understand and that we need to understand and there be a lot that we already do understand but be not do and that we need to be do thank you applause
