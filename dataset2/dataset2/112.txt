Kurt Andersen like many architect David be a hog for the limelight but be sufficiently reticent or at least pretend to be that he ask I to question he rather than speak in fact what we be go to talk about I think be in fact a subject that be probably well serve by a conversation than a address and I guess we have a bit of news clip to precede Dan Rather since the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center many person have flock to downtown New York to see and pay respects at what amount to the 16 acre burial ground now as CBS Jim Axelrod report they be put the finish touch on a new way for person to visit and view the scene Jim Axelrod forget the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty there be a new place in New York where the crowd be thick ground Zero Tourist I have take my step daughter here from Indianapolis this be out of all the tourist site in New York City this be she number one pick JA thousand now line up on low Broadway Tourist I have be want to come down here since this happen JA even on the cold winter day to honor and remember Tourist it be reality it be we it happen here this be ours JA so many in fact that see have become a bit of a problem Tourist I think that person be very frustrated that they be not able to get close to see what be go on JA but that be about to change in record time a team of architect and construction worker design and build a viewing platform to ease the frustration and bring person close Man they will get a incredible panorama and understand I think more completely the sheer totality of the destruction of the place JA if you think about it Ground Zero be unlike most any other tourist site in America unlike the Grand Canyon or the Washington Monument person come here to see what be no longer there David Rockwell the first experience person will have here when they see this be not as a construction site but as this incredibly move burial ground JA the wall be bare by design so person can fill they with they own memorial the way they already have along the current perimeter Tourist from we heart it affect we just as much JA the ramp be make of simple material the kind of plywood you see at construction site which be really the whole point in the face of America bad destruction person be build again Jim Axelrod CBS News New York ka this be not a obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment but certainly David you be know as I know a phrase you hate a entertainment architect you work be highly sensual even hedonistic DR I like that word ka it be about pleasure casino and hotel and restaurant how do the shock that all of we and especially all of we in New York feel on the 11th of September transmute into you desire to do this thing DR well the truth of the matter be post September 11th I feel myself in the role originally first of all as someone who live in Tribeca and whose neighborhood be devastate and as someone who work less than a mile from there that I be in the role of force 100 person who work with I in my firm to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm about create the place we have be create in fact we be finish a book which be call pleasure which be about sensual pleasure in space but I have get to tell you it become impossible to do that we be really paralyzed and I find myself the Friday after September 11th two day afterwards literally unable to motivate anyone to do anything we give the office a few day off and in discuss this with other architect we have see person say in the press that they should rebuild the tower as they be they should rebuild they 50 story tall and I think it be astonishing to speculate as if this be a competition on something that be such a fresh wound and I have a series of discussion first with Rick Scofidio and Liz Diller who collaborate with we on this and several other person and really feel like we have to find relevance in do something and that as person who create place the ultimate way to help be not to pontificate or to make up scenario but to help right now so we try to come up with a way as a group to have a kind of design swat team and that be the mission that we come up with ka be you conscious of suddenly as a designer whose work be all about fulfil want suddenly fulfil need DR well what I be aware of be there be this overwhelming need to act now and we be ask to participate in a few project before this there be a school PS 234 that have be evacuate down at Ground Zero they move to a abandon school we take about 20 or 30 architect and designer and artist and over four day it be like this urban barn raise to renovate it and everyone want to help it be just extraordinary Tom Otterness contribute Maira Kalman contribute and it become this cathartic experience for we ka and that be do effectively by October 8 or something DR yeah ka obviously what you face in try to do something as substantial as this project and this be only one of four that you have design to surround the site you must have run up against the incredibly byzantine entrenched bureaucracy and power that be in New York real estate and New York politics DR well it be a funny thing we finish PS 234 and have dinner with a small group I be actually ask to be a committee chair on a AIA committee to rebuild and I sit in on several meeting and there be the most circuitous grand plan that have to do with long term infrastructure and rebuild the entire city and the fact be that there be immediate wound and need that need to be fill and there be talk about inclusion and want it to be a inclusive process and it be not a inclusive group so we say what be ka it be not a inclusive group DR it be not a inclusive group it be predominantly a white rich corporate group that be not representative of the city ka shock DR yeah surprising so Rick and Liz and Kevin and I come up with the idea the city actually approach we we first approach the city about Pier 94 we see how PS 234 work the family the victim of the family be go to this pier that be incredibly dehumanizing ka on the Hudson River DR yeah and the city actually through Tim Zagat initially and then through Christyne Nicholas then we get to Giuliani say you know we do not want to do anything with Pier 94 right now but we have a observation platform for the family down at Ground Zero that we would like to be a more dignified experience for the family and a way to protect it from the weather so I go down there with Rick and Liz and Kevin and I have get to say it be the most moving experience of my life it be devastate to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it where the family of the victim have leave note to they and there be no mediation between we and the experience there be no filter and I remember on September 11th on 14th Street the roof of we building we can see the World Trade Towers prominently and I see the first building collapse from a conference room on the eighth floor on a tv that we have set up and then everyone be up on the roof so I run up there and it be amazing how much hard it be to believe in real life than it be on tv there be something about the comfort of the filter and how much information be between we and the experience so see this in a very simple dignified way be a very powerful experience so we go back to the city and say we be not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a vip platform but we have spend some time down there at the same time the city have this need they be look for a solution to deal with 30 or 40 thousand person a day who be go down there that have nowhere to go and there be no way to deal with the traffic around the site so deal with it be just a immediate master plan there be a way there have to be a way to get person to move around the site ka but then you have get to figure out a way we will skip over the insanely tedious process of get permit and get everybody on board but simply fund this thing it look like a fairly simple thing but this be a half a million dollar project DR well we know that if it be not privately fund it be not go to happen and we also frankly know that if it do not happen by the end of the Giuliani administration then everyone who we be deal with at the DOT and the Police Department and all of the we be meet with 20 or 30 person with the city at a time and it be set up by the Office of Emergency Management this incredible act on they part because they really want this and they sense that this need to happen ka and there be therefore this tick clock because Giuliani be obviously out three month after that DR yeah so the first thing we have to do be find a way to get this we have to work with the family of the victim through the city to make sure that they know this be happen because this do not want to be a surprise and we also have to be as under the radar screen as we could be in New York because the key be not raise a lot of objection and sort of work as quietly as possible we come up with the idea of set up a foundation mainly because when we find a contractor who would build this he would not agree to do this even if we would pay he the money there need to be a foundation in place so we come up with a foundation and actually what happen be one major developer in New York ka who shall remain nameless I guess DR yeah he initial be JS and he own Rockefeller Center if that help anyone volunteer to help and we meet with he the price from the contractor be between five to 700 000 dollar and Atlantic Heydt who be the large scaffolding contractor in the country volunteer to do it at cost so this developer say you know what we will underwrite the entire expense and we say that be incredible and I think this be the 21st and we know this have to be build and up by the 28th and we have to start construction the next day we have a meeting that evening with he contractor of choice and the contractor show up with the drawing of the platform about half the size that we have draw it ka sort of like the spinal tap scene where you get the tiny little Stonehenge I guess laughter DR in fact it be as if this be go to be window washing scaffolding there be no sense of the fact that this be next to Saint Paul that this be really a place that need to be kind of dignified and a place to reflect and remember and I have get to say that we spend a lot of time in put this together watch the crowd that gather at Saint Paul which be just to the right and move around the site and I live down there so we spend a lot of time look at the need and I think person be amazed at two thing I think they be amazed at the destruction but I think there be a sense of disbelief about the heroics of New Yorkers that I find very moving just the sort of everyday heroics of New Yorkers so we be in this meeting and the contractor literally say I be go to lock the door because this developer will not agree to have you leave till you have sign off on this and we say well this be half the size it do not have any of the design feature that have be agree upon by everyone everyone in the city we would have to go back to the beginning to do this and I convince he that we should leave the room with the agreement to build it as design the next day I get a email from the developer say that he be withdraw all funding so we do not know what to do but we decide to cast a very wide net we email out letter to as many person as we could several person in the audience here who be very helpful ka there be no thought of abandon ship at that point DR No in fact I tell the contractor to go ahead he have already order material base on my go ahead we know that one way or another this be go to happen and we just feel it have to happen ka you be fund it yourself and with contribution and this foundation Richard I think very correctly make the point at the beginning before all the chair designer come out about the history of chair designer impose aesthetic solution on this kind of universal banal common problem of sit it seem to I with this that it be the opposite of that this be a unprecedented singular design problem DR Well here be the issue we know that this be not in the sense of we think about the site and think about the need for a memorial it be important that this not be categorize as a memorial that this be a place for person to reflect to remember a kind of quiet place so it lead we to use design solution that create as few filter between the viewer as we say about the family platform and the experience as possible it be all incredibly humble material it be scaffolding and plywood and it allow by sort of the procession of the movement up by Saint Paul and down the other side it give you about 300 foot to go up 13 foot from the ground to where you get the 360 degree view but the design be drive by a need to be quick cheap safe respectful flexible one of the other thing be this be design to be moveable because when we look at the four platform around the site one of which be a upgrade of the family platform we know that this have to be moveable to respond to change condition and the change definition of what Ground Zero be ka you work I mean we have talk about this before a lot of you work I think be inform by you belief in or you focus on the temporariness of all thing and the evanescence of thing and a kind of eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die sort of sense of existence this be clearly not a work for the age you know a couple of year this thing be not go to be here do that require as a architect a new way of think about what you be do to think of it as this purely temporary installation DR No I do not think so I think this be obviously substantially different from anything we have ever think about do before just by the nature of it where it overlap with thought about we work in general be number one the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get thing do and Kevin Kennon Rick Scofidio Liz Diller and all the person within the city Norman Lear who I speak to four hour before we deadline for fund offer to give we a bridge loan to help we get through it so the notion of collaboration I think this reinforce how important that be and in term of the temporary nature of it we goal be not to create something that would be there long than it need to be I think what we be most interested in be promote a kind of dialogue that we feel may not have be happen enough in this city about what be really happen there and a day or two before it open be Giuliani farewell address where he propose the idea of all of Ground Zero be a memorial which be very controversial but it resonate with a lot of person and I think regardless of what the position be about how this sacred piece of land be to be use have it come out of actually see it in a real encounter I think make it a more powerful dialogue and that be what we be interested in so that very much be in the realm of thing I have be interested in before ka it seem to I among other thing a lovely piece of civic infrastructure it enable that conversation to get serious and six month after the fact and only a few month away from the site be clean we be very quickly now get to the point where that conversation about what should go there be get serious do you have have be as physically involve in the site as you have be do this project have any idea about what should or should not be do DR well I think one thing that should not be do be evaluate I think right now the discussion be a very closed discussion on the master plan the Protetch Gallery recently have a show on idea for building which have some sort of inventive idea of building ka but it have some really terrible idea DR and it also feel a little bit like a kind of competition of idea where I think the focus of idea should be on master planning and use and I think there should be a broad which there be start to be the dialogue be really open up to what do this site really want to be and I truly believe until the issue of memorial be sort out that it be go to be very hard to have a intelligent discussion there be a few discussion right now that I think be very positive about depress the West Side Highway and connect this over so that there be one uninterrupted piece of land ka well I think that be interesting and it get to another issue that be probably inappropriate to discuss six month ago but perhaps be not now which be not many of we love the World Trade Center as a piece of architecture as what it have do to this city and that huge plaza be this a opportunity be the silver line a silver lining here to rebuild some more traditional city grid or not DR I think there be a real opportunity to engage in a discussion of why we live in city and why do we live in place where such dissimilar person collide up against we each day I do not think it have much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thousand new office space regardless of what the number be so yeah I think there be a chance to be look at how we think about city and in fact there be a proposal on the table now for build number seven ka which be the building just north of the Towers DR Right which the tower fall into and the reason that be be hold up be essentially by community outrage that they be not re open the street to connect that back to the rest of the city I think a public dialogue I think you know I would like to see a international competition and a call for idea for use ka whether it be art whether it be housing whether it be what amount of shopping DR Right and we be look for other thing this small foundation we put together be look for other way to help include take a small piece adjacent to the site and invite 10 architect who currently do not have a voice in New York to do artist housing and find other way to encourage the discussion to be against sort of monolithic single solution and more about a multiplicity of thing ka before we end I know you have a piece of digital video of the experience of be on this platform DR John Kamen who be here actually put together a two and a half minute piece that show the platform in use so I think that would be good to end with DR we be look from Fulton Street west one of the tricky issue we have with the Giuliani administration be I have forget how anti graffito he be and essentially we structure be design to be write on ka as you say it be not a memorial but be you conscious of memorial the Vietnam Memorial that kind of form DR we certainly do as much research as we could and we be conscious of other memorial and also the complexity and length of time they really take to do it be 350 person on the committee for Oklahoma City which be why we think of this as a sort of ad hoc spontaneous solution that expand on Union Square and the place that be ad hoc memorial in the city already the scaffolding you can see build up over the street be de mountable what be interesting now be the nature of the site have totally change so that what you be aware of be not just the destruction of the building in Ground Zero but all of the building around it and the scar on the building around it which be enormous this show Saint Paul on the left ka I just want to thank you on behalf of New Yorkers for make this happen and get this do but the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection and its be there almost before you could believe that a response of this magnitude could be accomplish be part of its extraordinary I do not know if beauty be the word but presence DR it be a honor to do and we be thrilled to be able to show it here
