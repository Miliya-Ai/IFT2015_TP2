I want to talk to you today a little bit about predictable irrationality and my interest in irrational behavior start many year ago in the hospital I be burn very badly and if you spend a lot of time in hospital you will see a lot of type of irrationality and the one that particularly bother I in the burn department be the process by which the nurse take the bandage off I now you must have all take a Band Aid off at some point and you must have wonder what be the right approach do you rip it off quickly short duration but high intensity or do you take you Band Aid off slowly you take a long time but each second be not as painful which one of that be the right approach the nurse in my department think that the right approach be the rip one so they would grab hold and they would rip and they would grab hold and they would rip and because I have 70 percent of my body burn it would take about a hour and as you can imagine I hate that moment of rip with incredible intensity and I would try to reason with they and say why do not we try something else why do not we take it a little long maybe two hour instead of a hour and have less of this intensity and the nurse tell I two thing they tell I that they have the right model of the patient that they know what be the right thing to do to minimize my pain and they also tell I that the word patient do not mean to make suggestion or to interfere or this be not just in Hebrew by the way it be in every language I have have experience with so far and you know there be not much there be not much I could do and they keep on do what they be do and about three year later when I leave the hospital I start study at the university and one of the most interesting lesson I learn be that there be a experimental method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way and you can try to examine this question maybe learn something about the world so that be what I do I be still interested in this question of how do you take bandage off burn patient so originally I do not have much money so I go to a hardware store and I buy a carpenter vice and I would bring person to the lab and I would put they finger in it and I would crunch it a little bit laughter and I would crunch it for long period and short period and pain that go up and pain that go down and with break and without break all kind of version of pain and when I finish hurt person a little bit I would ask they so how painful be this or how painful be this or if you have to choose between the last two which one would you choose laughter I keep on do this for a while laughter and then like all good academic project I get more funding I move to sound electrical shock I even have a pain suit that I could get person to feel much more pain but at the end of this process what I learn be that the nurse be wrong here be wonderful person with good intention and plenty of experience and nevertheless they be get thing wrong predictably all the time it turn out that because we do not encode duration in the way that we encode intensity I would have have less pain if the duration would have be long and the intensity be low it turn out it would have be good to start with my face which be much more painful and move toward my leg give I a trend of improvement over time that would have be also less painful and it also turn out that it would have be good to give I break in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain all of this would have be great thing to do and my nurse have no idea and from that point on I start think be the nurse the only person in the world who get thing wrong in this particular decision or be it a more general case and it turn out it be a more general case there be a lot of mistake we do and I want to give you one example of one of this irrationality and I want to talk to you about cheat and the reason I pick cheat be because it be interesting but also it tell we something I think about the stock market situation we be in so my interest in cheat start when Enron come on the scene explode all of a sudden and I start think about what be happen here be it the case that there be kind of a few apple who be capable of do this thing or be we talk a more endemic situation that many person be actually capable of behave this way so like we usually do I decide to do a simple experiment and here be how it go if you be in the experiment I would pass you a sheet of paper with 20 simple math problem that everybody could solve but I would not give you enough time when the five minute be over I would say pass I the sheet of paper and I will pay you a dollar per question person do this I would pay person four dollar for they task on average person would solve four problem other person I would tempt to cheat I would pass they sheet of paper when the five minute be over I would say please shred the piece of paper put the little piece in you pocket or in you backpack and tell I how many question you get correctly person now solve seven question on average now it be not as if there be a few bad apple a few person cheat a lot instead what we see be a lot of person who cheat a little bit now in economic theory cheat be a very simple cost benefit analysis you say what be the probability of be catch how much do I stand to gain from cheat and how much punishment would I get if I get catch and you weigh this option out you do the simple cost benefit analysis and you decide whether it be worthwhile to commit the crime or not so we try to test this for some person we vary how much money they could get away with how much money they could steal we pay they 10 cent per correct question 50 cent a dollar five dollar 10 dollar per correct question you would expect that as the amount of money on the table increase person would cheat more but in fact it be not the case we get a lot of person cheat by steal by a little bit what about the probability of be catch some person shredded half the sheet of paper so there be some evidence leave some person shred the whole sheet of paper some person shred everything go out of the room and pay themselves from the bowl of money that have over 100 dollar you would expect that as the probability of be catch go down person would cheat more but again this be not the case again a lot of person cheat by just by a little bit and they be insensitive to this economic incentive so we say if person be not sensitive to the economic rational theory explanation to this force what could be go on and we think maybe what be happen be that there be two force at one hand we all want to look at ourselves in the mirror and feel good about ourselves so we do not want to cheat on the other hand we can cheat a little bit and still feel good about ourselves so maybe what be happen be that there be a level of cheat we can not go over but we can still benefit from cheat at a low degree as long as it do not change we impression about ourselves we call this like a personal fudge factor now how would you test a personal fudge factor initially we say what can we do to shrink the fudge factor so we get person to the lab and we say we have two task for you today first we ask half the person to recall either 10 book they read in high school or to recall the ten commandment and then we tempt they with cheat turn out the person who try to recall the ten commandment and in we sample nobody could recall all of the ten commandment but that person who try to recall the ten commandment give the opportunity to cheat do not cheat at all it be not that the more religious person the person who remember more of the commandment cheat less and the less religious person the person who could not remember almost any commandment cheat more the moment person think about try to recall the ten commandment they stop cheat in fact even when we give self declare atheist the task of swear on the Bible and we give they a chance to cheat they do not cheat at all now ten commandment be something that be hard to bring into the education system so we say why do not we get person to sign the honor code so we get person to sign I understand that this short survey fall under the MIT Honor Code then they shred it no cheating whatsoever and this be particularly interesting because MIT do not have a honor code laughter so all this be about decrease the fudge factor what about increase the fudge factor the first experiment I walk around MIT and I distribute six pack of Cokes in the refrigerator this be common refrigerator for the undergrad and I come back to measure what we technically call the half lifetime of Coke how long do it last in the refrigerator as you can expect it do not last very long person take it in contrast I take a plate with six one dollar bill and I leave that plate in the same refrigerator no bill ever disappear now this be not a good social science experiment so to do it good I do the same experiment as I describe to you before a third of the person we pass the sheet they give it back to we a third of the person we pass it to they shred it they come to we and say Mr Experimenter I solve x problem give I x dollar a third of the person when they finish shred the piece of paper they come to we and say Mr Experimenter I solve x problem give I x token we do not pay they with dollar we pay they with something else and then they take the something else they walk 12 foot to the side and exchange it for dollar think about the follow intuition how bad would you feel about take a pencil from work home compare to how bad would you feel about take 10 cent from a petty cash box this thing feel very differently would be a step remove from cash for a few second by be pay by token make a difference we subject double they cheat I will tell you what I think about this and the stock market in a minute but this do not solve the big problem I have with Enron yet because in Enron there be also a social element person see each other behave in fact every day when we open the news we see example of person cheat what do this cause we so we do another experiment we get a big group of student to be in the experiment and we prepay they so everybody get a envelope with all the money for the experiment and we tell they that at the end we ask they to pay we back the money they do not make ok the same thing happen when we give person the opportunity to cheat they cheat they cheat just by a little bit all the same but in this experiment we also hire a act student this act student stand up after 30 second and say I solve everything what do I do now and the experimenter say if you have finish everything go home that be it the task be finish so now we have a student a act student that be a part of the group nobody know it be a actor and they clearly cheat in a very very serious way what would happen to the other person in the group will they cheat more or will they cheat less here be what happen it turn out it depend on what kind of sweatshirt they be wear here be the thing we run this at Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh and at Pittsburgh there be two big university Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh all of the subject sit in the experiment be Carnegie Mellon student when the actor who be get up be a Carnegie Mellon student he be actually a Carnegie Mellon student but he be a part of they group cheat go up but when he actually have a University of Pittsburgh sweatshirt cheat go down laughter now this be important because remember when the moment the student stand up it make it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheat because the experimenter say you have finish everything go home and they go with the money so it be not so much about the probability of be catch again it be about the norm for cheat if somebody from we in group cheat and we see they cheat we feel it be more appropriate as a group to behave this way but if it be somebody from another group this terrible person I mean not terrible in this but somebody we do not want to associate ourselves with from another university another group all of a sudden person awareness of honesty go up a little bit like the ten commandment experiment and person cheat even less so what have we learn from this about cheat we have learn that a lot of person can cheat they cheat just by a little bit when we remind person about they morality they cheat less when we get big distance from cheat from the object of money for example person cheat more and when we see cheat around we particularly if it be a part of we in group cheat go up now if we think about this in term of the stock market think about what happen what happen in a situation when you create something where you pay person a lot of money to see reality in a slightly distorted way would they not be able to see it this way of course they would what happen when you do other thing like you remove thing from money you call they stock or stock option derivative mortgage back security could it be that with that more distant thing it be not a token for one second it be something that be many step remove from money for a much long time could it be that person will cheat even more and what happen to the social environment when person see other person behave around they I think all of that force work in a very bad way in the stock market more generally I want to tell you something about behavioral economics we have many intuition in we life and the point be that many of this intuition be wrong the question be be we go to test that intuition we can think about how we be go to test this intuition in we private life in we business life and most particularly when it go to policy when we think about thing like no child leave behind when you create new stock market when you create other policy taxation health care and so on and the difficulty of test we intuition be the big lesson I learn when I go back to the nurse to talk to they so I go back to talk to they and tell they what I find out about remove bandage and I learn two interesting thing one be that my favorite nurse Ettie tell I that I do not take she pain into consideration she say of course you know it be very painful for you but think about I as a nurse take remove the bandage of somebody I like and have to do it repeatedly over a long period of time create so much torture be not something that be good for I too and she say maybe part of the reason be it be difficult for she but it be actually more interesting than that because she say I do not think that you intuition be right I feel my intuition be correct so if you think about all of you intuition it be very hard to believe that you intuition be wrong and she say give the fact that I think my intuition be right she think she intuition be right it be very difficult for she to accept do a difficult experiment to try and check whether she be wrong but in fact this be the situation we be all in all the time we have very strong intuition about all kind of thing we own ability how the economy work how we should pay school teacher but unless we start test that intuition we be not go to do good and just think about how good my life would have be if this nurse would have be willing to check they intuition and how everything would have be good if we just start do more systematic experimentation of we intuition thank you very much
