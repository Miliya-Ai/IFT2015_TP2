you have all see lot of article on climate change and here be yet another New York Times article just like every other darn one you have see it say all the same stuff as all the other one you have see it even have the same amount of headline as all the other one you have see what be unusual about this one maybe be that it be from 1953 and the reason I be say this be that you may have the idea this problem be relatively recent that person have just sort of figure out about it and now with Kyoto and the Governator and person begin to actually do something we may be on the road to a solution the fact be uh uh we have know about this problem for 50 year depend on how you count it we have talk about it endlessly over the last decade or so and we have accomplish close to zip this be the growth rate of co2 in the atmosphere you have see this in various form but maybe you have not see this one what this show be that the rate of growth of we emission be accelerate and that it be accelerate even fast than what we think be the bad case just a few year back so that red line there be something that a lot of skeptic say the environmentalist only put in the projection to make the projection look as bad as possible that emission would never grow as fast as that red line but in fact they be grow fast here be some datum from actually just 10 day ago which show this year minimum of the Arctic Sea ice and it be the low by far and the rate at which the Arctic Sea ice be go away be a lot quick than model so despite all sort of expert like I fly around the planet and burn jet fuel and politician sign treaty in fact you could argue the net effect of all this have be negative because it be just consume a lot of jet fuel laughter no no in term of what we really need to do to put the brake on this very high inertial thing we big economy we have really hardly start really we be do this basically really not very much I do not want to depress you too much the problem be absolutely soluble and even soluble in a way that be reasonably cheap cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military not the cost of medical care cheap mean a few percent of GDP No this be really important to have this sense of scale so the problem be soluble and the way we should go about solve it be say deal with electricity production which cause something like 43 or so percent and rise of co2 emission and we could do that by perfectly sensible thing like conservation and wind power nuclear power and coal to co2 capture which be all thing that be ready for giant scale deployment and work all we lack be the action to actually spend the money to put that into place instead we spend we time talk but nevertheless that be not what I be go to talk to you about tonight what I be go to talk to you about tonight be stuff we might do if we do nothing and it be this stuff in the middle here which be what you do if you do not stop the emission quickly enough and you need to deal somehow break the link between human action that change climate and the climate change itself and that be particularly important because of course while we can adapt to climate change and it be important to be honest here there will be some benefit to climate change oh yes I think it be bad I have spend my whole life work to stop it but one of the reason it be politically hard be there be winner and loser not all loser but of course the natural world polar bear I spend time skiing across the sea ice for week at a time in the high Arctic they will completely lose and there be no adaption so this problem be absolutely soluble this geo engineering idea in it be simple form be basically the follow you could put sign particle say sulfuric acid particle sulfate into the upper atmosphere the stratosphere where they have reflect away sunlight and cool the planet and I know for certain that that will work not that there be not side effect but I know for certain it will work and the reason be it be be do and it be do not by we not by I but by nature here be Mount Pinatubo in the early 90 that put a whole bunch of sulfur in the stratosphere with a sort of atomic bomb like cloud the result of that be pretty dramatic after that and some previous volcano we have you see a quite dramatic cooling of the atmosphere so this low bar be the upper atmosphere the stratosphere and it heat up after this volcano but you will notice that in the upper bar which be the low atmosphere and the surface it cool down because we shield the atmosphere a little bit there be no big mystery about it there be lot of mystery in the detail and there be some bad side effect like it partially destroy the ozone layer and I will get to that in a minute but it clearly cool down and one other thing it be fast it be really important to say so much of the other thing that we ought to do like slow emission be intrinsically slow because it take time to build all the hardware we need to reduce emission and not only that when you cut emission you do not cut concentration because concentration the amount of co2 in the air be the sum of emission over time so you can not step on the brake very quickly but if you do this it be quick and there be time you might like to do something quick another thing you might wonder about be do it work can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the add co2 and produce a climate sort of back to what it be originally and the answer seem to be yes so here be the graph you have see lot of time before that be what the world look like under one particular climate model view with twice the amount of co2 in the air the low graph be with twice the amount of co2 and 1 8 percent less sunlight and you be back to the original climate and this graph from Ken Caldeira it be important to say come because Ken at a meeting that I believe Marty Hoffart be also at in the mid 90 Ken and I stand up at the back of the meeting and say Geo engineering will not work and to the person who be promote it say the atmosphere much more complicated give a bunch of physical reason why it would not do a very good compensation Ken go and run he model and find that it do this topic be also old that report that land on President Johnson desk when I be two year old 1965 that report in fact which have all the modern climate science the only thing they talk about do be geo engineering it do not even talk about cut emission which be a incredible shift in we think about this problem I be not say we should not cut emission we should but it make exactly this point so in a sense there be not much new the one new thing be this essay so I should say I guess that since the time of that original President Johnson report and the various report of the U S National Academy 1977 1982 1990 person always talk about this idea not as something that be foolproof but as a idea to think about but when climate become politically a hot topic if I may make the pun in the last 15 year this become so un pc we could not talk about it it just sink below the surface we be not allow to speak about it but in the last year Paul Crutzen publish this essay say roughly what be all be say before that maybe give we very slow rate of progress in solve this problem and the uncertain impact we should think about thing like this he say roughly what be be say before the big deal be he happen to have win the Nobel prize for ozone chemistry and so person take he seriously when he say we should think about this even though there will be some ozone impact and in fact he have some idea to make they go away there be all sort of press coverage all over the world go right down to Dr Strangelove save the Earth from the economist and that get I think I have work on this topic on and off but not so much technically and I be actually lie in bed think one night and I think about this child toy hence the title of my talk and I wonder if you could use the same physics that make that thing spin round in the child radiometer to levitate particle into the upper atmosphere and make they stay there one of the problem with sulfate be they fall out quickly the other problem be they be right in the ozone layer and I would prefer they above the ozone layer and it turn out I wake up the next morning and I start to calculate this it be very hard to calculate from first principle I be stumped but then I find out that there be all sort of paper already publish that address this topic because it happen already in the natural atmosphere so it seem there be already fine particle that be levitate up to what we call the mesosphere about 100 kilometer up that already have this effect I will tell you very quickly how the effect work there be a lot of fun complexity that I have love to spend the whole evening on but I will not but let say you have sunlight hit some particle and it be unevenly heat so the side face the sun be warm the side away cool gas molecule that bounce off the warm side bounce away with some extra velocity because it be warm and so you see a net force away from the sun that be call the photophoretic force there be a bunch of other version of it that I and some collaborator have think about how to exploit and of course we may be wrong this have not all be peer review we be in the middle of think about it but so far it seem good but it look like we could achieve long atmospheric lifetime much long than before because they be levitate we can move thing out of the stratosphere into the mesosphere in principle solve the ozone problem I be sure there will be other problem that arise finally we could make the particle migrate to over the pole so we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focus on the pole which would have minimal bad impact in the middle of the planet where we live and do the maximum job of what we might need to do which be cool the pole in case of planetary emergency if you like this be a new idea that be creep up that may be essentially a clever idea than put sulfate in whether this idea be right or some other idea be right I think it be almost certain we will eventually think of clever thing to do than just put sulfur in that if engineer and scientist really turn they mind to this it be amazing how we can affect the planet the one thing about this be it give we extraordinary leverage this improve science and engineering will whether we like it or not give we more and more leverage to affect the planet to control the planet to give we weather and climate control not because we plan it not because we want it just because science deliver it to we bite by bit with good knowledge of the way the system work and good engineering tool to effect it now suppose that space alien arrive maybe they be go to land at the U N headquarters down the road here or maybe they will pick a smart spot but suppose they arrive and they give you a box and the box have two knob one knob be the knob for control global temperature maybe another knob be a knob for control co2 concentration you might imagine that we would fight war over that box because we have no way to agree about where to set the knob we have no global governance and different person will have different place they want it set now I do not think that be go to happen it be not very likely but we be build that box the scientist and engineer of the world be build it piece by piece in they lab even when they be do it for other reason even when they be think they be just work on protect the environment they have no interest in crazy idea like engineer the whole planet they develop science that make it easy and easy to do and so I guess my view on this be not that I want to do it I do not but that we should move this out of the shadow and talk about it seriously because soon or late we will be confront with decision about this and it be good if we think hard about it even if we want to think hard about reason why we should never do it I will give you two different way to think about this problem that be the beginning of my thinking about how to think about it but what we need be not just a few oddball like I think about this we need a broad debate a debate that involve musician scientist philosopher writer who get engage with this question about climate engineering and think seriously about what its implication be so here be one way to think about it which be that we just do this instead of cut emission because it be cheap I guess the thing I have not say about this be it be absurdly cheap it be conceivable that say use the sulfate method or this method I have come up with you could create a ice age at a cost of 001 percent of GDP it be very cheap we have a lot of leverage it be not a good idea but it be just important laughter I will tell you how big the lever be the lever be that big and that calculation be not much in dispute you might argue about the sanity of it but the leverage be real laughter so because of this we could deal with the problem simply by stop reduce emission and just as the concentration go up we can increase the amount of geo engineering I do not think anybody take that seriously because under this scenario we walk further and further away from the current climate we have all sort of other problem like ocean acidification that come from co2 in the atmosphere anyway nobody but maybe one or two very odd folk really suggest this but here be a case which be hard to reject let say that we do not do geo engineering we do what we ought to do which be get serious about cut emission but we do not really know how quickly we have to cut they there be a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change be too much so let say that we work hard and we actually do not just tap the brake but we step hard on the brake and really reduce emission and eventually reduce concentration and maybe someday like 2075 October 23 we finally reach that glorious day where concentration have peak and be roll down the other side and we have global celebration and we have actually start to you know we have see the bad of it but maybe on that day we also find that the Greenland ice sheet be really melt unacceptably fast fast enough to put meter of sea level on the ocean in the next 100 year and remove some of the big city from the map that be a absolutely possible scenario we might decide at that point that even though geo engineering be uncertain and morally unhappy that it be a lot good than not geo engineering and that be a very different way to look at the problem it be use this as risk control not instead of action it be say that you do some geo engineering for a little while to take the bad of the heat off not that you would use it as a substitute for action but there be a problem with that view and the problem be the follow knowledge that geo engineering be possible make the climate impact look less fearsome and that make a weak commitment to cut emission today this be what economist call a moral hazard and that be one of the fundamental reason that this problem be so hard to talk about and in general I think it be the underlying reason that it be be politically unacceptable to talk about this but you do not make good policy by hide thing in a drawer I will leave you with three question and then one final quote should we do serious research on this topic should we have a national research program that look at this not just at how you would do it good but also what all the risk and downside of it be right now you have a few enthusiast talk about it some in a positive side some in a negative side but that be a dangerous state to be in because there be very little depth of knowledge on this topic a very small amount of money would get we some many of we maybe now I think we should do that but I have a lot of reservation my reservation be principally about the moral hazard problem and I do not really know how we can well avoid the moral hazard I think there be a serious problem as you talk about this person begin to think they do not need to work so hard to cut emission another thing be maybe we need a treaty a treaty that decide who get to do this right now we may think of a big rich country like the U S do this but it might well be that in fact if China wake up in 2030 and realize that the climate impact be just unacceptable they may not be very interested in we moral conversation about how to do this and they may just decide they would really rather have a geo engineer world than a non geo engineer world and we will have no international mechanism to figure out who make the decision so here be one last thought which be say much much good 25 year ago in the U S National Academy report than I can say today and I think it really summarize where we be here that the co2 problem the climate problem that we have hear about be drive lot of thing innovation in the energy technology that will reduce emission but also I think inevitably it will drive we towards think about climate and weather control whether we like it or not and it be time to begin think about it even if the reason we be think about it be to construct argument for why we should not do it thank you very much
