I draw to well understand thing sometimes I make a lot of drawing and I still do not understand what it be I be draw that of you who be comfortable with digital stuff and even smug about that relationship might be amuse to know that the guy who be well know for the way thing work while prepare for part of a panel for call understand spend two day try to get he laptop to communicate with he new cd burner who know about extension manager I have always manage my own extension so it never even occur to I to read the instruction but I do finally figure it out I have to figure it out because along with the invitation come the frightening reminder that there would be no projector so bring that carousel would no longer be necessary but some alternate form of communication would now I could talk about something that I be know for something that would be particularly appropriate for many of the more technically minded person here or I could talk about something I really care about I decide to go with the latter i be go to talk about Rome now why would I care about Rome particularly well I go to Rhode Island School of Design in the second half of the 60 to study architecture I be lucky enough to spend my last year my fifth year in Rome as a student it change my life not the least reason be the fact that I have spend that first four year live at home drive into RISD everyday drive back I miss the 60 I read about they laughter I understand they be pretty interesting I miss they but I do spend that extraordinary year in Rome and it be a place that be never far from my mind so whenever give a opportunity I try to do something in it or with it or for it I also make draw to help person understand thing thing that I want they to believe I understand and that be what I do as a illustrator that be my job so I be go to show you some picture of Rome I have make a lot of drawing of Rome over the year this be just draw of Rome I get back as often as possible I need to all different material all different style all different time draw from sketchbook look at the detail of Rome Part of the reason I be show you this be that it sort of help illustrate this process I go through of try to figure out what it be I feel about Rome and why I feel it this be sketch of some of the little detail Rome be a city full of surprise I mean we be talk about unusual perspective we be talk about narrow little wind street that suddenly open into vast sun drench piazza never though piazza that be not humanly scale part of the reason for that be the fact that they grow up organically that amazing juxtaposition of old and new the bit of light that come down between the building that sort of create a map that be travel above you head of usually blue especially in the summer compare to the map that you would normally expect to see of conventional street and I begin to think about how I could communicate this in book form how could I share my sense of Rome my understanding of Rome and I be go to show you a bunch of dead end basically the primary reason for all this dead end be when if you be not quite sure where you be go you be certainly not go to get there with any kind of efficiency here be a little map and I think of map at the beginning maybe I should just try and do a little atla of my favorite street and connection in Rome and here be a line of text that actually evolve from the exhaust of a scooter zip across the page here that same line of text wrap around a fountain in a illustration that can be turn upside down and read both way maybe that line of text could be a story to help give some human aspect to this maybe I should get away from this map completely and really be honest about want to show you my favorite bit and piece of Rome and simply kick a soccer ball in the air which happen in so many of the square in the city and let it bounce off of thing and I will simply explain what each of that thing be that the soccer ball hit that seem like a sort of a cheap shot but even though I just start this presentation this be not the first thing that I try to do and I be get sort of desperate eventually I realize that I have really no content that I could count on so I decide to move towards packaging laughter I mean it seem to work for a lot of thing so I think a little box set of four small book might do the trick but one of the idea that emerge from some of that sketch be the notion of travel through Rome in different vehicle at different speed in order to show the different aspect of Rome Sort of a overview of Rome and the plan that you might see from a dirigible quick snapshot of thing you might see from a speeding motor scooter and very slow walk through Rome you might be able to study in more detail some of the wonderful surface and whatnot that you come across anyways I go back to the dirigible notion go to Alberto Santos Dumont find one of he dirigible that have enough dimension so I could actually use it as a scale that I would then juxtapose with some of the thing in Rome this thing would be fly over or past or be park in front of but it would be like have a ruler sort of travel through the page without be a ruler not that you know how long number 11 actually be but you would be able to compare number 11 against the Pantheon with number 11 against the bath of Caracalla and so on and so forth if you be interested this be Beatrix she have a dog name Ajax she have purchase a dirigible a small dirigible she be assemble the structure Ajax be sniff for hole in the balloon before they set off she launch this thing above the Spanish step and set off for a aerial tour of the city over the Spanish step we go a nice way to show that river that stream sort of pour down the hill unfortunately just across the road from it or quite close by be the Column of Marcus Aurelius and the diameter of the dirigible make a impression as you can see as she start try to read the story that spiral around the Column of Marcus Aurelius get a little too close nudge it this give I a chance to suggest to you the structure of the Column of Marcus Aurelius which be really no more than a pile of quarter high thick quarter over the Piazza of Saint Ignacio completely ruin the symmetry but that aside a spectacular place to visit a spectacular framework inside of which you see usually extraordinary blue sky over the Pantheon and the 26 foot diameter Oculus she park she dirigible low the anchor rope and climb down for a close look inside the text here be right side and upside down so that you be force to turn the book around and you can see it from ground point of view and from she point of view look in the hole get a different kind of perspective move you around the space particularly appropriate in a building that can contain perfectly a sphere dimension of the diameter be the same as the distance from the center of the floor to the center of the Oculus unfortunately for she the anchor line get tangle around the foot of some boy scout who be visit the Pantheon and they be immediately yank out and give a extraordinary but terrifying tour of some of the dome of Rome which would from they point of view naturally be hang upside down they bail out as soon as they get to the top of Saint Ivo that little spiral structure you see there she continue on she way over Piazza Navona notice a lot of activity at the Tre Scalini restaurant be remind that it be lunchtime and she be hungry they keep on motoring towards the Campo de Fiori which they soon reach Ajax the dog be put in a basket and low with a list of food into the marketplace which flourish there until about one in the afternoon and then be completely remove and do not appear again until six or seven the follow morning anyway the pooch get back to the dirigible with the stuff unfortunately when she go to unwrap the prosciutto Ajax make a lunge for it she be manage to save the prosciutto but in the process she lose the tablecloth which you can see fly away in the upper left hand corner they continue without they tablecloth look for a place to land this thing so that they can actually have lunch they eventually discover a huge wall that be fill with small hole ideal for dock a dirigible because you have get a place to tie up turn out to be the exterior wall that part of it that remain of the Coliseum so they park themselves there and have a terrific lunch and have a spectacular view at the end of lunch they untie the anchor they set off through the bath of Caracalla and over the wall of the city and then a abandon gatehouse and decide to take one more look at the pyramid of Cestius which have this lightning rod on top unfortunately that be a problem they get a little too close and when you be in a dirigible you have to be very careful about spike so that sort of bring she little story to a conclusion Marcello on the other hand be sort of a lazy guy but he be not due at work until about noon so the alarm go off and it be five to 12 or so he get up leap onto he scooter race through the city past the church of Santa Maria della pace down the alley through the street that tourist may be wander through disturb the quiet backstreet life of Rome at every turn that speed with which he be move I hope I have suggest in this little image which again can be turn around and read from both side because there be text on the bottom and text on the top one of which be upside down in this image so he keep on move approach a unsuspecting waiter who be try to deliver two plate of linguine in a delicate white wine clam sauce to diner who be sit at a table just outside of a restaurant in the street Waiter catch on but it be too late and Marcello keep move in he scooter everything he see from this point on be slightly affect by the linguine but keep on move because this guy be get a job to do remove some scaffolding one of the reason Rome remain the extraordinary place it be that because of scaffolding and the determination to maintain the fabric it be a city that continue to grow and adapt to the need of the particular time in which it find itself or we find it right through the Piazza della Rotonda in front of the Pantheon again wreak havoc and finally get to work Marcello as it turn out be the driver of the number 64 bus and if you have be on the number 64 bus you know that it be drive with the same kind of exuberance as Marcello demonstrate on he scooter and finally Carletto you see he apartment in the upper left hand corner he be look at he table he be plan to propose this evening to he girlfriend of 40 year laughter and he want it to be perfect he be get candle out he be get flower in the middle and he be try to figure out where to put the plate and the glass but he be not happy something wrong the phone ring anyway he be call to the palazzo he saunter he saunter at a good clip but as compare to all the traveling we have just see he be saunter everybody know carletto because he be in entertainment actually he be in television he be actually in television repair which be why person know he so they all have he number he arrive at the palazzo arrive at the big front door enter the courtyard and talk to the custodian who tell he that there be be a disaster in the palazzo nobody be tv be work and there be a big soccer game come up and the crowd be get a little restless and a little nervous he go down to the basement and start to check the wiring and then gradually work he way up to the top of the building apartment by apartment check every television check every connection hope to find out what this problem be he work he way up finally the grand staircase and then a small staircase until he reach the Attic he open the window of the Attic of course and there be a tablecloth wrap around the building television antenna he remove it the problem be solve everybody in the palazzo be happy and of course he also solve he own problem all he have to do now with a perfect table be wait for she to arrive that be the first attempt but it do not seem substantial enough to convey whatever it be I want to convey about Rome so I think well I will just do piazza and I will get inside and underneath and I will show this thing grow and show why they be shape the way they be and so on and then I think that be too complicated no I will just take my favorite bit and piece and I will put they inside the Pantheon but keep the scale so you can see the top of Sant Ivo and the pyramid of Cestius and the Tempietto of Bramante all side by side in this amazing space now that be one draw so I think maybe it be time for Piranesi to meet Escher laughter you see that I be begin to really lose control here and also hope there be a very thin blue line of exhaust that sort of run through this thing that would be kind of the trail that hold it all together then I think wait a minute what be I do a book be not only a neat way of collect and store information it be a series of layer I mean you always peel one layer off another we think of they as page do it a certain way but think of they as layer I mean Rome be a place of layer horizontal layer vertical layer and I think well just peel off a page would allow I to if I get you think about it the right way would allow I to sort of show you the depth of layer the stucco on the wall of most of the building in Rome cover the scar the scar of century of change as this structure have be adapt rather than be tear down if I do a foldout page on the left hand side and let you just unfold it you see behind it what I mean by scar tissue you can see that in 1635 it become essential to make small window because the bad guy be come or whatever adaptation all get bury under the stucco I could peel out a page of this palazzo to show you what be go on inside of it but more importantly I could also show you what it look like at the corner of one of that magnificent building with all the massive stone block or the fake stone block do with brick and stucco which be more often the case so it become slightly three dimensional I could take you down one of that narrow little street into one of that surprising piazza by use a double gate fold double foldout page which if you be like I read a pop up book as a child you hopefully stick you head into you wrap the page around you head and be in that piazza for that brief period of time and I have really not do anything much more complicated than make foldout page but then I think maybe I could be simple here let look at the Pantheon and the Piazza della Rotonda in front of it here be a book completely wide open ok if I do not open the book the whole way if I just open it 90 degree we be look down the front of the Pantheon and we be look sort of at the top more or less down on the square and if I turn the book the other way we be look across the square at the front of the Pantheon No foldout no trick just a book that be not open the whole way that seem promising I think maybe I will do it inside and I can even combine the foldout with the only partially open book so we get inside the Pantheon and it grow and so on and so forth and I think maybe I be on the right track but it sort of lose its human quality so I go back to the notion of story which be always a good thing to have if you be try to get person to pay attention to a book and pick up information along the way Pigeon Progress strike I as a catchy title if it be a homing pigeon it would be call Homer odyssey but it be the journey of the laughter I mean if a title work use it but it would be a journey that go through Rome and show all the thing that I like about Rome it be a pigeon sit on top of a church go off during the day and do normal pigeon stuff come back the whole place be cover with scaffolding and green netting and there be no way this pigeon can get home so it be a homeless pigeon now and it be go to have to find another place to live and that allow I to go through my catalog of favorite thing and we start with the tall one and so on maybe it have to go back and live with family member that be not always a good thing but it do sort of bring pigeon together again and I think that be sort of interesting but maybe there be a person who should be involve in this in some way so I kind of come up with this old guy who spend he life look after sick pigeon he will go anywhere to get they dangerous place and whatnot and they become really friend with this guy and learn to do trick for he and entertain he at lunchtime and stuff like that there be a real bond that develop between this old man and this pigeon but unfortunately he get sick he get really sick at the end of the story he be teach they to spell he name which be Aldo they show up one day after three or four day of not see he he live in this little garret and they spell he name and fly around and he finally get enough strength together to climb up the ladder onto the roof and all the pigeon a la Red Balloon be there wait for he and they carry he off over the wall of the city and I forget to mention this whenever he lose a pigeon he would take that pigeon out beyond the wall of the city in the old Roman custom the dead be never bury within the wall and I think that be a really cheery story laughter that be really go to go a long way so anyway I go through and again if packaging do not work and if the story be not go anywhere I just come up with title and hope that a title will sort of kick I off in the right direction and sometimes it do focus I enough and I will even do a title page so this be all title page that eventually lead I to the solution I settle on which be the story of a young woman who send a message on a homing pigeon she live outside the wall of the city of Rome to someone in the city and the pigeon be fly down above the Appian Way here you can see the tomb and pine and so on and so forth along the way if you see the red line you be see the trail of the pigeon if you do not see the red line you be the pigeon and it become necessary and possible at this point to try to convey what that sense would be like of fly over the city without actually move past the pyramid of Cestius this will seem very familiar to you even if you have not be to Rome recently past the gatehouse this be something that be a little bit unusual this pigeon do something that most homing pigeon do not do it take the scenic route laughter which be a device that I feel be necessary to actually extend this book beyond about four page so we circle around the Coliseum past the Church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin and the Temple of Hercules towards the river we almost collide with the cornice of the Palazzo Farnese design by Michelangelo build of stone take from the Coliseum narrow escape we swoop down over the Campo de Fiori this be one of that thing I show to my student because it be a complete bastardization a denial of any rule of perspective the only rule of perspective that I think matter be if it look believable you have succeed but you try and figure out where the vanish point meet here a couple be on Mars and a couple of other in Cremona but into the piazza in front of Santa Maria della Pace where invariably a soccer game be go on and we be hit by a soccer ball now this be a terrible illustration of be hit by a soccer ball I have all the piece there be Santa Maria della Pace there be a soccer ball there be a little bit of a bird wing nothing be happen so I have to rethink it and if you do want to see Santa Maria della Pace this book be really flexible incredibly interactive just turn it around and look at it the other way through the alley we can see the impact be capture in the red line and then bird manage to pull itself together past this medieval tower one of the few remain medieval tower towards the church of sant agnese and around the dome look down into Piazza Navona which we have already mention and see and fly over a couple of time there be the Bernini statue of the Four Rivers and then past the wonderful Borromini Sant Ivo stop just long enough on the 26 foot diameter Oculus of the Pantheon to catch we breath and then we can swoop inside and around and because we be fly we do not really have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time so this drawing can be orient in any way on the page we get a little exuberant as we pass Gesu it be not surprising to sort of mimic the architecture in this way past the wonderful wall fill with the juxtaposition that I be talk about beautiful carving set into the wall above the neon Ristorante sign and so on and eventually we arrive at the courtyard of the palazzo which be we destination straight up through the courtyard into a little window into the Attic where somebody be work at the drawing board he remove the message from the leg of the bird this be what it say as we look at the drawing board we see what he be work on be in fact a map of the journey that the pigeon have just take and the red line extend through all the sight and if you want the information so that we complete this cycle of understand all you have to do be read this paragraph thank you very much
