in this rather long sort of marathon presentation I have try to break it up into three part the first be a whole lot of example on how it can be a little bit more pleasurable to deal with a computer and really address the quality of the human interface and this will be some simple design quality and they will also be some quality of if you will the intelligence of interaction then the second part will really just be example of new technology new media fall very much into that mold again I will go through they as fast as possible and then the last one will be some example I have be able to collect which I think illustrate this at least as good I can in the world of entertainment person have this belief and I share most of it that we will be use the tv screen or they equivalent for electronic book of the future but then you think my God what a terrible image you get when you look at still picture on TV well it do not have to be terrible and that be a slide take from a tv set and it be pre process to be very sympathetic to the tv medium and it absolutely look beautiful well what be happen how do person get into this mess where you be now all of a sudden sit in front of personal computer and video text teletext system and somewhat horrified by what you see on the screen well you have to remember that tv be design to be look at eight time the distance of the diagonal so you get a 13 inch 19 inch whatever tv and then you should multiply that by eight and that be the distance you should sit away from the tv set now we have put person 18 inch in front of a tv and all the artifact that none of the original designer expect to be see all of a sudden be stare you in the face the shadow mask the scan line all of that and they can be treat very easily there be actually way of get rid of they there be actually way of just make absolutely beautiful picture I be talk here a little bit about display technology let I talk about how you might input information and my favorite example be always finger I be very interested in touch sensitive display high tech high touch be not that what some of you say it be certainly a very important medium for input and a lot of person think that finger be a very low resolution sort of stylus for input to a display in fact they be not it be really a very very high resolution input medium you have to just do it twice you have to touch the screen and then rotate you finger slightly and you can move a cursor with great accuracy and so when you see on the market this system that have just a few light emit diode on the side and be very low resolution it be nice that they exist because it still be good than nothing but it in some sense miss the point namely that finger be a very very high resolution input medium now what be some of the other advantage well the one advantage be that you do not have to pick they up and person do not realize how important that be not have to pick up you finger to use they laughter when you think for a second of the mouse on Macintosh and I will not criticize the mouse too much when you be type what you have you want to now put something first of all you have get to find the mouse you have to probably stop maybe not come to a grind halt but you have get to sort of find that mouse then you find the mouse and you be go to have to wiggle it a little bit to see where the cursor be on the screen and then when you finally see where it be then you have get to move it to get the cursor over there and then Bang you have get to hit a button or do whatever that be four separate step versus type and then touch and type and just do it all in one motion or one and a half depend on how you want to count again what I be try to do be just illustrate the kind of problem that I think face the designer of new computer system and entertainment system and educational system from the perspective of the quality of that interface and another advantage of course of use finger be you have 10 of they and we have never know how to do this technically so this slide be a fake slide we never succeed in use ten finger but there be certain thing you can do obviously with more than one finger input which be rather fascinating what we do stumble across be something again which be typical of the computer field be when you have a bug that you can not get rid of you turn it into a feature and maybe laughter maybe a mouse be a new kind of bug but the bug in we case be in touch sensitive display we want to be able to draw you know rub you finger across the screen to input continuous point and there be just too much friction create between you finger and the glass if glass be the substrate which it usually be so we find that that actually be a feature in the sense you could build a pressure sensitive display and when you touch it with you finger you can actually then introduce all the force on the face of that screen and that actually have a certain amount of value let I see if I can load another disc and show you quickly a example now imagine a screen which be not only touch sensitive now it be pressure sensitive and it be pressure sensitive to the force both in the plane of the screen x y and z at least in one direction we could not figure out how to come in the other direction but let I get rid of the slide and let see if this come on ok so there be the pressure sensitive display in operation the person just if you will push on the screen to make a curve but this be the interesting part I want to stop it for a second because the movie be very badly make and the particular display be build about six year ago and when we move from one room to another room a rather large person sit on it and it get destroy so all we have be this record laughter but imagine that screen have lot of object on it and the person have touch a object one of n like he do there and then push on it now imagine a program where some of that object be physically heavy and some be light one be a anvil on a fuzzy rug and the other one be a ping pong ball on a sheet of glass and when you touch it you have to really push very hard to move that anvil across the screen and yet you touch the ping pong ball very lightly and it just scoot across the screen and what you can do oops I do not mean to do that what you can do be actually feed back to the user the feeling of the physical property so again they do not have to be weight they could be a general try to move troops and he be get to move a aircraft carrier versus a little boat in fact they fund it for that very reason laughter the whole notion then be one that at the interface there be physical property in that transducer in this case it be pressure and touch that allow you to present thing to the user that you could never present before so it be not simply look at the quality or if you will the luxury of that interface but it be actually look at the idea of present thing that previously could not be present before I want to move on to another example which be one of a different sort where we be try to use computer and video disc technology now to come up with a new kind of book here the idea be that you be go to take this book if you will and it be go to come alive you be go to sort of breathe life into it we be so used to do monologue filmmaker for example be the expert in monologue make you make a film and it have a well form begin middle and end and in some sense the art of it be that and you then say there be a opportunity for make conversational movie well what do that mean and it sort of nibble at the core of the whole profession and all the assumption of that medium so book writing be the same thing what I will show you very quickly be a new kind of book where it be mix now with all sort of thing live in there but you have to keep a few thing in mind one be that this book know about itself each frame of the movie have information about itself so it know or at least there be computer readable information in the medium itself it be just not a static movie frame that be one thing the other be that you have to realize that it be a random access medium and you can in fact branch and expand and elaborate and shrink and here again my favorite example be the cookbook the Larousse Gastronomique and I think I use the example all too often but it be a great one because there be a classic ending in that little encyclopedia style cookbook that tell you how to do something like penguin and you get to the end of the recipe and it say Cook until do now that would be if you will the top green track which do not mean too much but you might have to elaborate for I or for somebody who be not a expert and say Cook at 380 degree for 45 minute and then for a real beginner you would go down even far and elaborate more say open the oven preheat wait for the light to go out open the door do not leave it open too long put the penguin in and shut the door laughter whatever and that be a much more elaborate one than you dribble back that be one kind of use of random access and the other be where you want to explain the same thing in different way if you be in a classroom situation and somebody ask a question the last thing you do be repeat what you just say you try and think of a different way of say the same thing or if you know the particular student and that student cognitive style then you might say it in a way that you think would have a good impedance match with that student there be all sort of technique you will use and again this be a different kind of branch so what I will show you be it be a rather boring book but I be afraid sometimes you have to do boring book because you sponsor be not necessarily interested in fiction and entertainment and this be a book on how to repair a transmission now I do not even know what vintage the transmission be but let I just show you very quickly some of it and we will move on Video Narrator and continue to get description for each of this chapter Nicholas Negroponte now this be he table of contents just a picture of the transmission and as you rub you finger across the transmission it highlight the various part Narrator when I find a chapter that I want to see I just touch the text and the system will format page for I to read the word or phrase that be light up in red be glossary word so I can get a different definition by just touch the word and the definition appear superimpose over the illustration NN this be about the oil pan or the oil filter and all that this be relatively important because it set the page Narrator this be another example of a page with glossary word highlight in red I can get a definition of this word just by touch they and the definition will appear in the illustration corner I can get back to the illustration but in this case it be not a single frame but it be actually a movie of someone come into the frame and do the repair that be describe in the text the two head slider be a speed control that allow I to watch the movie at various speed in forward or reverse and the movie be display as a full frame movie I can go back to the beginning and play the movie at full speed here be another step by step procedure only in this case NN okay this movie be everybody hear of sound sync movie this be text sync movie so as the movie play the text get highlight we highlight the text as we go through the movie repairman not too far out Front pole preferably do not loosen they too far if you loosen they too far you will have a big mess NN I suspect that some of you might not even understand that language laughter ok I be at the third and last part of this which I say I would make a attempt to at least give you some example that may be more directly relate to the world of entertainment and of course good education have get to be good entertainment so my first example will be draw from a very recent experiment that we have be do in this case in Senegal where we have try to use personal computer as a pedagogical medium but not as teaching machine at all the whole notion be to use this as a instrument where there be a complete reversal of role the child be if you will the teacher and the machine be the student and the art of computer programming be a vehicle that sort of approximate think about think but teach kid program per se be utterly irrelevant and there be just a few slide I want to go through but there be a story I would like to tell and that be when before we do this in any develop country we be do it in fact in three develop country right now Pakistan Colombia and Senegal we do it in some pretty rough area of New York City and one child whose name I have forget be about seven or eight year old absolutely consider mentally handicapped could not read do not even make it in the low section of the school class and be pretty much not in school though physically there but do hang around the quote computer room where there be quite a few computer and learn this particular language call Logo and learn it with great ease and find it a lot of fun it be very interesting and one day by chance some visitor from the NIE come by in they double breasted suit look at this setup and none of the child who be normally there except for this one child be there he be and he say let I show you how this work and they get a absolutely ingenuous wonderful description of Logo and the child be just zip right through it show they all sort of thing until they ask he how to do something which he could not explain and so he flip through the manual find the explanation and type the command and get it to do what they ask they be delighted and by the time it be time to go see the principal whom they have actually come to see not the computer room they go upstairs and they say this be absolutely remarkable that child be very articulate and show we and even deal with the thing he could not do automatically with that manual it be just absolutely fantastic the principal say there be a dreadful mistake because that child can not read and you obviously have be hoodwink or you have talk about somebody else and they all get up and they all go downstairs and the child be still there and they do something very intelligent they ask the child can you read and the child say no I can not and then they say but wait a minute you just look through that manual and you find and he say oh but that be not read and so they say well what be read then he say well reading be this junk they give I in little book to read it be absolutely irrelevant laughter and I get nothing for it but here with a little bit of effort I get a lot of return and it really mean something to the child the child read beautifully it turn out and be really very competent so it actually mean something and that story have many other anecdote that be similar but wow the key to the future of computer in education be right there and it be when do it mean something to a child there be a myth and it truly be a myth we believe and I be sure a lot of you believe in this room that it be hard to read and write than it be to learn how to speak and it be not but we think speech my God little child pick it up somehow and by the age of two they be do a mediocre job and by three and four they be speak reasonably well and yet you have get to go to school to learn how to read and you have to sit in a classroom and somebody have to teach you hence it must be hard well it be not hard what the truth be be that speaking have great value to a child the child can get a great deal by talk to you read and write be utterly useless there be no reason for a child to read and write except blind faith and that it be go to help you laughter so what happen be you go to school and person say just believe I you be go to like it you be go to like reading and just read and read on the other hand you give a kid a three year old kid a computer and they type a little command and poof something happen and all of a sudden you may not call that reading and writing but a certain bit of type and read stuff on the screen have a huge payoff and it be a lot of fun and in fact it be a powerful educational instrument well in Senegal we find that this be the traditional classroom 120 kid three per desk one teacher a little bit of chalk this student be one of we first student and it be the girl on the left leaning with she chalkboard and she come within two day I want to show you the program she write and remember she hairstyle and that be the program she make that be what mean something to she be do the hair pattern and actually do it within two day a hour each day and find it be to she absolutely the most meaningful piece but root in that little do she know how much knowledge she be acquire about geometry and just math and logic and all the rest and again I could talk for three hour about this subject I will come to my last example and then quit and my last example as some of my former colleague whom I see in the room can imagine what it will be yes it be it be we work that be a while ago and it still be my favorite project of teleconferencing and the reason it remain a favorite project be that we be ask to do a teleconferencing system where you have the follow situation you have five person at five different site they be know person and you have to have this person in teleconference such that each one be utterly convinced that the other four be physically present now that be sufficiently zany that we would obviously jump to the bait and we do and the fact that we know the person we have to take a page out of the history of Walt Disney we actually go so far as to build CRTs in the shape of the person face so if I want to call my friend Peter Sprague on the phone my secretary would get he head out and bring it and set it on the desk laughter and that would be the tv use for the occasion and it be uncanny there be no way I can explain to you the amount of eye contact you get with that physical face project on a 3d CRT of that sort the next thing that we have to do be to persuade they that there need to be spatial correspondence which be straightforward but again it be something that do not fall naturally out of a telecommunications or compute style of think it be a very if you will architectural or spatial concept and that be to recognize that when you sit around the table the actual location of the person become rather important and when somebody get up in fact to go answer a phone or use a bathroom or something the empty seat become if you will that person and you point frequently to the empty seat and you say he or she would not agree and the empty chair be that person and the spatiality be crucial so we say well this will be on round table and the order around the table have to be the same so that at my site I would be if you will real and then at each other site you would have this plastic head and the plastic head sometimes you want to project they and there be a number of scheme which I do not want to dwell on but this be the one that we finally use where we project onto rear screen material that be mold in the face literally in the face of the person and I will show you one more slide where this be actually make from something call a solid photograph and be the screen now we track on the person head the head motion so we transmit with a video the head position and so this head move in about two axis so if I all of a sudden turn to the person to my left and start talk to that person then at the person to my right site he will see this two plastic head talk to each other and then if that person interrupt then that two head may turn and it really be reconstruct quite accurately teleconferencing
