hi I be here to talk to you about the importance of praise admiration and thank you and have it be specific and genuine and the way I get interested in this be I notice in myself when I be grow up and until about a few year ago that I would want to say thank you to someone I would want to praise they I would want to take in they praise of I and I would just stop it and I ask myself why I feel shy I feel embarrassed and then my question become am I the only one who do this so I decide to investigate I be fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility so I get to see person who be face life and death with addiction and sometimes it come down to something as simple as they core wound be they father die without ever say he be proud of they but then they hear from all the family and friend that the father tell everybody else that he be proud of he but he never tell the son it be because he do not know that he son need to hear it so my question be why do not we ask for the thing that we need I know a gentleman marry for 25 year who be longing to hear he wife say thank you for be the breadwinner so I can stay home with the kid but will not ask I know a woman who be good at this she once a week meet with she husband and say I have really like you to thank I for all this thing I do in the house and with the kid and he go oh this be great this be great and praise really do have to be genuine but she take responsibility for that and a friend of mine April who I have have since kindergarten she thanks she child for do they chore and she say why would not I thank it even though they be suppose to do it so the question be why be I block it why be other person block it why can I say I will take my steak medium rare I need size six shoe but I will not say would you praise I this way and it be because I be give you critical datum about I I be tell you where I be insecure I be tell you where I need you help and I be treat you my inner circle like you be the enemy because what can you do with that datum you could neglect I you could abuse it or you could actually meet my need and I take my bike into the bike store I love this same bike and they would do something call true the wheel the guy say you know when you true the wheel it be go to make the bike so much good I get the same bike back and they have take all the little warp out of that same wheel I have have for two and a half year and my bike be like new so I be go to challenge all of you I want you to true you wheel be honest about the praise that you need to hear what do you need to hear go home to you wife go ask she what do she need go home to you husband what do he need go home and ask that question and then help the person around you and it be simple and why should we care about this we talk about world peace how can we have world peace with different culture different language I think it start household by household under the same roof so let make it right in we own backyard and I want to thank all of you in the audience for be great husband great mother friend daughter son and maybe somebody never say that to you but you have do a really really good job and thank you for be here just show up and change the world with you idea thank you applause
