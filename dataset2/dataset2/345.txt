Art this be now for sale at the Metropolitan Museum this be still at the Metropolitan Museum now for sale this be a portrait of my daughter and myself applause this be just some of the thing I have make I make hundred of they for the last 75 year I call myself a maker of thing I do not call myself a industrial designer because I be other thing industrial designer want to make novel thing Novelty be a concept of commerce not a aesthetic concept the industrial design magazine I believe be call Innovation Innovation be not part of the aim of my work well maker of thing they make thing more beautiful more elegant more comfortable than just the craftsman do I have so much to say I have to think what I be go to say well to describe we profession otherwise we be actually concern with the playful search for beauty that mean the playful search for beauty be call the first activity of Man Sarah Smith who be a mathematics professor at MIT write the playful search for beauty be Man first activity that all useful quality and all material quality be develop from the playful search for beauty this be tile the word playful be a necessary aspect of we work because actually one of we problem be that we have to make produce lovely thing throughout all of life and this for I be now 75 year so how can you without dry up make thing with the same pleasure as a gift to other for so long the playful be therefore a important part of we quality as designer let I tell you some about my life as I say I start to do this thing 75 year ago my first exhibition in the United States be at the Sesquicentennial exhibition in 1926 that the Hungarian government send one of my hand draw piece as part of the exhibit my work actually take I through many country and show I a great part of the world this be not that they take I the work do not take I I make the thing particularly because I want to use they to see the world I be incredibly curious to see the world and I make all this thing which then finally do take I to see many country and many culture I start as a apprentice to a Hungarian craftsman and this teach I what the guild system be in Middle Ages the guild system that mean when I be a apprentice I have to apprentice myself in order to become a pottery master in my shop where I study or learn there be a traditional hierarchy of master journeyman and learn worker and apprentice and I work as the apprentice the work as a apprentice be very primitive that mean I have to actually learn every aspect of make pottery by hand we mash the clay with we foot when it come from the hillside after that it have to be knead it have to then go in kind of a mangle and then finally it be prepare for the throw and there I really work as a apprentice my master take I to set oven because this be part of oven make oven setting in the time and finally I have receive a document that I have accomplish my apprenticeship successfully that I have behave morally and this document be give to I by the guild of roof Coverers Rail Diggers Oven setter Chimney sweep and potter laughter I also get at the time a workbook which explain my right and my working condition and I still have that workbook first I set up a shop in my own garden and make pottery which I sell on the marketplace in Budapest and there I be sit and my then boyfriend I do not mean it be a boyfriend like it be mean today but my boyfriend and I sit at the market and sell the pot my mother think that this be not very proper so she sit with we to add propriety to this activity laughter however after a while there be a new factory be build in Budapest a pottery factory a large one and I visit it with several lady and ask all sort of question of the director then the director ask I why do you ask all this question I say I also have a pottery so he ask I could he please visit I and then finally he do and explain to I that what I do now in my shop be a anachronism that the industrial revolution have break out and that I rather should join the factory there he make a art department for I where I work for several month however everybody in the factory spend he time at the art department the director there say there be several woman cast and produce my design now in mold and this be sell also to America I remember that it be quite successful however the director the chemist model maker everybody concern himself much more with the art department that mean with my work than make toilet so finally they get a letter from the center from the bank who own the factory say make toilet set behind the art department and that be my end so this give I the possibility because now I be a journeyman and journeyman also take they satchel and go to see the world so as a journeyman I put a ad into the paper that I have study that I be a down to earth potter journeyman and I be look for a job as a journeyman and I get several answer and I accept the one which be farth from home and practically I think halfway to America and that be in Hamburg then I first take this job in Hamburg at a art pottery where everything be do on the wheel and so I work in a shop where there be several potter and the first day I be come to take my place at the turntable there be three or four turntable and one of they behind where I be sit be a hunchback a deaf mute hunchback who smell very bad so I douse he in cologne every day which he think be very nice and therefore he bring bread and butter every day which I have to eat out of courtesy the first day I come to work in this shop there be on my wheel a surprise for I my colleague have thoughtfully put on the wheel where I be suppose to work a very nicely model natural man organ laughter after I brush they off with a hand motion they be very
