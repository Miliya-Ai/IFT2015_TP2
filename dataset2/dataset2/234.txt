well I be involve in other thing besides physics in fact mostly now in other thing one thing be distant relationship among human language and the professional historical linguist in the U S and in Western Europe mostly try to stay away from any long distance relationship big grouping grouping that go back a long time long than the familiar family they do not like that they think it be crank I do not think it be crank and there be some brilliant linguist mostly Russian who be work on that at Santa Fe Institute and in Moscow and I would love to see where that lead do it really lead to a single ancestor some 20 25 000 year ago and what if we go back beyond that single ancestor when there be presumably a competition among many language how far back do that go how far back do modern language go how many ten of thousand of year do it go back Chris Anderson do you have a hunch or a hope for what the answer to that be Murray Gell Mann well I would guess that modern language must be old than the cave painting and cave engraving and cave sculpture and dance step in the soft clay in the cave in Western Europe in the Aurignacian Period some 35 000 year ago or early I can not believe they do all that thing and do not also have a modern language so I would guess that the actual origin go back at least that far and maybe further but that do not mean that all or many or most of today attest language could not descend perhaps from one that be much young than that like say 20 000 year or something of that kind it be what we call a bottleneck CA Well Philip Anderson may have be right you may just know more about everything than anyone so it be be a honor thank you Murray Gell Mann applause
