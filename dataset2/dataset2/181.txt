this be you conference and I think you have a right to know a little bit right now in this transition period about this guy who be go to be look after it for you for a bit so I be just go to grab a chair here two year ago at TED I think I have come to this conclusion I think I may have be suffer from a strange delusion I think that I may have believe unconsciously then that I be kind of a business hero I have this company that I have spend 15 year build it be call Future it be a magazine publish company it have recently go public and the market say that it be apparently worth two billion dollar a number I do not really understand a magazine I have recently launch call business 2 0 be fat than a telephone directory busy pump hot air into the bubble laughter and I be the 40 percent owner of a dotcom that be about to go public and no doubt be worth billion more and all this have come from nothing fifteen year early I be a science journalist who person just laugh at when I say I really would like to start my own computer magazine and 15 year later there be 100 of they and 2 000 person on staff and it be just such heady time the date be February 2000 I think the little graph of my business life that kind of look a bit like Moore Law ever upward and to the right it be go to go on forever I mean it have to right I be in for quite a surprise the dotcom ironically call Snowball be the very last consumer web company to go public the next month before NASDAQ explode and I enter 18 month of business hell I watch everything that I have build crumble and it look like all this stuff be go to die and 15 year work would have come for nothing and it be gut wrench it take eight year of blood sweat and tear to reach 350 employee something which I be very proud of in the business February 2001 in one day we lay off 350 person and before the bloodshed be finish 1 000 person have lose they job from my company I feel sick I watch my own net worth fall by about a million dollar a day every day for 18 month and bad than that far bad than that my sense of self worth be kind of evaporate I be go around with this big sign on my forehead loser laughter and I think what disgust I more than anything look back be how the hell do I let my personal happiness get so tie up with this business thing well in the end we be able to save future and Snowball but I be at that point ready to move on and to cut a long story short here be where I come to and the reason I be tell this story be that I believe from many conversation that a lot of person in this room have be through a similar kind of rollercoaster emotional rollercoaster in the last couple year this have be a big big transition time and I believe that this conference can play a big part for all of we in take we forward to the next stage to whatever be next the theme next year be re birth it be at the same TED two year ago when Richard and I reach a agreement on the future of TED and at about the same time and I think partly because of that I start do something that I have forget about in my business focus I start to read again and I discover that while I have be busy play business game there have be this incredible revolution in so many area of interest cosmology to psychology to evolutionary psychology to anthropology to all this stuff have change and the way in which you could think about we as a species and we as a planet have just change so much and it be incredibly exciting and what be really most exciting and I think Richard Wurman discover this at least 20 year before I do be that all this stuff be connect it be connect it all hook into each other we talk about this a lot and I think about try to give a example of this so just one example Madame de Gaulle the wife of the French president be famously ask once what do you most desire and she answer a penis and when you think about it it be very true what we all most desire be a penis or happiness as we say in English laughter and something good luck with that one in the Japanese translation room laughter applause but something as basic as happiness which 20 year ago would have be just something for discussion in the church or mosque or synagogue today it turn out that there be dozen of TED like question that you can ask about it which be really interesting you can ask about what cause it biochemically neuroscience serotonin all that stuff you can ask what be the psychological cause of it nature nurture current circumstance turn out that the research do on that be absolutely mind blow you can view it as a computing problem a artificial intelligence problem do you need to incorporate some sort of analog of happiness into a computer brain to make it work properly you can view it in sort of geopolitical term and say why be it that a billion person on this planet be so desperately needy that they have no possibility of happiness and whereas almost all the rest of they regardless of how much money they have whether it be two dollar a day or whatever be almost equally happy on average or you can view it as a evolutionary psychology kind of thing do we gene invent this as a kind of trick to get we to behave in certain way the ant brain parasitize to make we behave in certain way so that we gene would propagate be we the victim of a mass delusion and so on and so on to understand even something as important to we as happiness you kind of have to branch off in all this different direction and there be nowhere that I have discover other than TED where you can ask that many question in that many different direction and so it be the profound thing that Richard talk about to understand anything you just need to understand the little bit a little bit about everything that surround it and so gradually over this three day you start off kind of try to figure out why be I listen to all this irrelevant stuff and at the end of the four day you brain be hum and you feel energized alive and excited and it be because all this different bit have be put together it be the total brain experience we be go to it be the mental equivalent of the full body massage laughter every mental organ address it really be enough of the theory Chris tell we what you be actually go to do all right so I will here be the vision for TED Number one do nothing this thing be not break so I be not go to fix it Jeff Bezos kindly remark to I Chris TED be a really great conference you be go to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad laughter so I give myself the job title of TED Custodian for a reason and I will promise you right here and now that the core value that make TED special be not go to be interfere with Truth curiosity diversity no selling no corporate bullshit no bandwagon no platform just the pursuit of interest wherever it lie across all the discipline that be represent here that be not go to be change at all number two I be go to put together a incredible line up of speaker for next year the time scale on which TED operate be just fantastic after come out of a magazine business with monthly deadline there be a year to do this and already I hope to show you a bit later there be 25 or so terrific speaker sign up for next year and I be get fantastic help from the community this be just such a great community and combine we contact reach pretty much everyone who be interesting in the country if not the planet it be true number three I do want to if I can find a way of extend the TED experience throughout the year a little bit and one key way that we be go to do this be to introduce this book club book kind of save I in the last couple year and that be a gift that I would like to pass on so when you sign up for ted2003 every six week you will get a care package with a book or two and a reason why they be link to TED they may well be by a TED speaker and so we can get the conversation go during the year and come back next year have have the same intellectual emotional journey I think it will be great and then fourthly I want to mention the Sapling Foundation which be the new owner of TED what Sapling ownership mean be that all of the proceeds of TED will go towards the cause that Sapling stand for and more important I think the idea that be exhibit and realize here be idea that the foundation can use because there be fantastic synergy already just in the last few day we have have so many person talk about stuff that they care about that they be passionate about that can make a difference in the world and the idea of get this group of person together some of the cause that we believe in the money that this conference can raise and the idea I really believe that that combination will over time make a difference I be incredibly excited about that in fact I do not think overall that I have be as excite by anything ever in my life I be in this for the long run and I would be greatly honor and excite if you will come on this journey with I
