so I think I will talk about death seem to be the passion today actually it be not about death it be inevitable terrible but really what I want to talk about be I be just fascinate by the legacy person leave when they die that be what I want to talk about so Art Buchwald leave he legacy of humor with a video that appear soon after he die say hi I be Art Buchwald and I just die and Mike who I meet at Galapagos a trip which I win at TED be leave note on cyberspace where he be chronicle he journey through cancer and my father leave I a legacy of he handwriting through letter and a notebook in the last two year of he life when he be sick he fill a notebook with he think about I he write about my strength weakness and gentle suggestion for improvement quote specific incident and hold a mirror to my life after he die I realize that no one write to I anymore handwrit be a disappear art I be all for email and thinking while type but why give up old habit for new why can not we have letter write and email exchange in we life there be time when I want to trade all that year that I be too busy to sit with my dad and chat with he and trade all that year for one hug but too late but that be when I take out he letter and I read they and the paper that touch he hand be in mine and I feel connected to he so maybe we all need to leave we child with a value legacy and not a financial one a value for thing with a personal touch a autographed book a soul search letter if a fraction of this powerful TED audience could be inspire to buy a beautiful paper John it will be a recycled one and write a beautiful letter to someone they love we actually may start a revolution where we child may go to penmanship class so what do I plan to leave for my son I collect autographed book and that of you author in the audience know I hound you for they and cd too Tracy I plan to publish my own notebook as I witness my father body be swallow by fire I sit by he funeral pyre and write I have no idea how I be go to do it but I be commit to compile he think and mine into a book and leave that publish book for my son I would like to end with a few verse of what I write at my father cremation and that linguist please pardon the grammar because I have not look at it in the last 10 year I take it out for the first time to come here picture in a frame ash in a bottle boundless energy confine in the bottle force I to deal with reality force I to deal with be grow up I hear you and I know that you would want I to be strong but right now I be be suck down surround and suffocate by this rage emotional water craving to cleanse my soul try to emerge on a firm foot one more time to keep on fighting and flourish just as you teach I you encourage whisper in my whirlpool of despair hold i and heaving I to shore of sanity to live again and to love again thank you
