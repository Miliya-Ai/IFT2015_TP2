the career that I start early on in my life be look for exotic life form in exotic place and at that time I be work in the Antarctic and the Arctic and high desert and low desert until about a dozen year ago when I be really capture by cave and I really be focus most of my research in that direction so I have a really cool day job I get to do some really amazing stuff I work in some of the most extreme cave environment on the planet many of they be try to kill we from the minute we go into they but nevertheless they be absolutely gripping and contain unbelievable biological wonder that be very very different from that that we have on the planet apart from the intrinsic value of the biology and mineralogy and geo microbiology that we do there we be also use this as template for figure out how to go look for life on other planet particularly Mars but also Europa the small icy moon around Jupiter and perhaps someday far beyond we solar system itself I be very passionately interested in the human future on the Moon and Mars particularly and elsewhere in the solar system I think it be time that we transition to a solar system go civilization and species and as a outgrowth of all of this then I wonder about whether we can and whether we even should think about transport earth type life to other planet notably Mars as a first example something I never talk about in scientific meeting be how I actually get to this state and why I do the work that I do why do not I have a normal job a sensible job and then of course I blame the Soviet Union because in the mid 1950 when I be a tiny child they have the audacity to launch a very primitive little satellite call Sputnik which send the western world into a hysterical tailspin and a tremendous amount of money go into the funding of science and mathematics skill for kid and I be a product of that generation like so many other of my peer it really catch hold of we and catch fire and it would be lovely if we could reproduce that again now of course refuse to grow up even though I impersonate a grow up in daily life but I do a fairly good job of that but really retain that childlike quality of not care what other person think about what you be interested in be really critical the next element be the fact that I have apply a value judgment and my value judgment be that the presence of life be good than no life and so life be more valuable than no life and so I think that that hold together a great deal of the work that person in this audience approach I be very interested in Mars of course and that be a product of my be a young undergraduate when the vike Landers land on Mars and that take what have be a tiny little astronomical object in the sky that you would see as a dot and turn it completely into a landscape as that very first primitive picture come raster across the screen and when it become a landscape it also become a destination and alter really the course of my life in my graduate year I work with my colleague and mentor and friend Steve Schneider at the National Center for Atmospheric Research work on global change issue we have write a number of thing on the role of Gaia hypothesis whether or not you could consider Earth as a single entity in any meaningful scientific sense and then as a outgrowth of that I work on the environmental consequence of nuclear war so wonderful thing and grim thing but what it teach I be to look at Earth as a planet with external eye not just as we home and that be a wonderful step away in perspective to try to then think about the way we planet behave as a planet and with the life that be on it and all of this seem to I to be a salient point in history we be get ready to begin to go through the process of leave we planet of origin and out into the wide solar system and beyond so back to Mars how hard be it go to be to find life on Mars Well sometimes it be really very hard for we to find each other even on this planet so find life on another planet be a non trivial occupation and we spend a lot of time try to think about that whether or not you think it be likely to be successful sort of depend on what you think about the chance of life in the universe I think myself that life be a natural outgrowth of the increase complexification of matter over time so you start with the Big Bang and you get hydrogen and then you get helium and then you get more complicated stuff and you get planet form and life be a common planetary base phenomenon in my view certainly in the last 15 year we have see increase number of planet outside of we solar system be confirm and just last month a couple of week ago a planet in the size class of Earth have actually be find and so this be very exciting news so my first bold prediction be that be that in the universe life be go to be everywhere it be go to be everywhere we look where there be planetary system that can possibly support it and that planetary system be go to be very common so what about life on Mars well if somebody have ask I about a dozen year ago what I think the chance of life on Mars would be I would have probably say a couple of percent and even that be consider outrageous at the time I be once sneeringly introduce by a former NASA official as the only person on the planet who still think there be life on Mars of course that official be now dead and I be not so there be a certain amount of glory in outlive you adversary but thing have change greatly over the last dozen year and the reason that they have change be because we now have new information the amazing pathfinder mission that go in 97 and the MER Rover mission that be on Mars as we speak now and the European Space Agency Mars Express have teach we a number of amazing thing there be sub surface ice on that planet and so where there be water there be a very high chance of we kind of life there be clearly sedimentary rock all over the place one of the lander be sit in the middle of a ancient seabed and there be this amazing structure call blueberry which be this little rocky concretion that we be busy make biologically in my lab right now so with all of this thing put together I think that the chance of life be much great than I would have ever think I think that the chance of life have arise on Mars sometime in its past be maybe one in four to maybe even half and half so this be a very bold statement I think it be there and I think we need to go look for it and I think it be underground so the game afoot and this be the game that we play in astro biology how do you try to get a handle on extraterrestrial life how do you plan to look for it how do you know it when you find it because if it be big and obvious we would have already find it it would have already bite we on the foot and it have not so we know that it be probably quite cryptic very critically how do we protect it if we find it and not contaminate it and also even perhaps more critically because this be the only home planet we have how do we protect we from it while we study it so why might it be hard to find well it be probably microscopic and it be never easy to study microscopic thing although the amazing tool that we now have to do that allow we to study thing in much great depth at much small scale than ever before but it be probably hide because if you be out sequestering resource from you environment that make you yummy and other thing might want to eat you or consume you and so there be a game of predator prey that be go to be essentially universal really in any kind of biological system it also may be very very different in its fundamental property its chemistry or its size we say small but what do that mean be it virus sized be it small than that be it big than the big bacterium we do not know and speed of activity which be something that we face in we work with sub surface organism because they grow very very slowly if I be to take a swab off you tooth and plate it on a Petri plate within about four or five hour I would have to see growth but the organism that we work with from the sub surface of Earth very often it be month and in many case year before we see any growth whatsoever so they be intrinsically a slow life form but the real issue be that we be guide by we limit experience and until we can think out of the box of we cranium and what we know then we can not recognize what to look for or how to plan for it so perspective be everything and because of the history that I have just briefly talk to you about I have learn to think about Earth as a extraterrestrial planet and this have be invaluable in we approach to try to study this thing this be my favorite game on airplane where you be in a airplane and you look out the window you see the horizon I always turn my head on the side and that simple change make I go from see this planet as home to see it as a planet it be a very simple trick and I never fail to do it when I be sit in a window seat well this be what we apply to we work this show one of the most extreme cave that we work in this be Cueva de Villa Luz in Tabasco in Mexico and this cave be saturate with sulfuric acid there be tremendous amount of hydrogen sulfide come into this cave from volcanic source and from the breakdown of evaporite mineral below the carbonate in which this cave be form and it be a completely hostile environment for we we have to go in with protective suit and breathing gear and 30 part per million of h2 will kill you this be regularly several hundred part per million so it be a very hazardous environment with co as well and many other gas this extreme physical and chemical parameter make the biology that grow in this place very special because contrary to what you might think this be not devoid of life this be one of the rich cave that we have find on the planet anywhere it be burst with life the extreme on Earth be interesting in they own right but one of the reason that we be interested in they be because they represent really the average condition that we may expect on other planet so this be part of the ability that we have to try to stretch we imagination in term of what we may find in the future there be so much life in this cave and I can not even begin to scratch the surface of it with you but one of the most famous object out of this be what we call Snottites for obvious reason this stuff look like what come out of you two year old nose when he have a cold and this be produce by bacterium who be actually make more sulfuric acid and live at ph right around zero and so this stuff be like battery acid and yet everything in this cave have adapt to it in fact there be so much energy available for biology in this cave that there be actually a huge number of cavefish and the local zoque Indian harvest this twice a year as part of they Easter week celebration and Holy Week celebration this be very unusual for cave in some of the other amazing cave that we work in this be in Lechuguilla cave in New Mexico near Carlsbad and this be one of the most famous cave in the world it be 115 mile of map passage it be pristine it have no natural opening and it be a gigantic biological geo microbiological laboratory in this cave great area be cover by this reddish material that you see here and also this enormous crystal of selenite that you can see dangle down this stuff be produce biologically this be the breakdown product of the bedrock that organism be busy munch they way through they take iron and manganese mineral within the bedrock and they oxidize they and every time they do that they get a tiny little packet of energy and that tiny little packet of energy be what they use then to run they life process interestingly enough they also do this with uranium and chromium and various other toxic metal and so the obvious avenue for bio remediation come from organism like this this organism we now bring into the lab and you can see some of they grow on Petri plate and get they to reproduce the precise biomineral that we find on the wall of this cave so this be signal that they leave in the rock record well even in basalt surface in lava tube cave which be a by product of volcanic activity we find this wall totally cover in many case by this beautiful glisten silver wall or shiny pink or shiny red or shiny gold and this be mineral deposit that be also make by bacterium and you can see in this central image here scan electron micrograph of some of this guy this be garden of this bacterium one of the interesting thing about this particular guy be that they be in the actinomycete and streptomycete group of the bacterium which be where we get most of we antibiotic the sub surface of Earth contain a vast biodiversity and this organism because they be very separate from the surface make a vast array of novel compound and so the potential for exploit this for pharmaceutical and industrial chemical use be completely untapped but probably exceed most of the rest of the biodiversity of the planet so lava tube cave I have just tell you about organism that live here on this planet we know that on Mars and the Moon there be ton of this structure we can see they on the leave you can see a lava tube form at a recent eruption Mount Etna in Sicily and this be the way this tube form and when they hollow out then they become habitat for organism this be all over the planet Mars and we be busy catalogue they now and so there be very interesting cave real estate on Mars at least of that type in order to access this sub surface environment that we be interested in we be very interested in develop the tool to do this you know it be not easy to get into this cave it require crawl climb rope work technical rope work and many other complex human motion in order to access this we face the problem of how can we do this robotically why would we want to do it robotically well we be go to be send robotic mission to Mars long in advance of human mission and then secondly get back to that early point that I make about the preciousness of any life that we may find on Mars we do not want to contaminate it and one of the good way to study something without contaminate it be to have a intermediary and in this case we be imagine intermediary robotic device that can actually do some of that front end work for we to protect any potential life that we find I be not go to go through all of this project now but we be involve in about half a dozen robotic development project in collaboration with a number of different group I want to talk specifically about the array that you see on the top this be hop microbot swarm I be work on this with the Field and Space Robotics Laboratory and my friend Steve Dubowsky at MIT and we have come up with the idea of have little jumping bean like robot that be propel by artificial muscle which be one of the Dubowsky Lab specialty be the EPAMs or artificial muscle and this allow they to hop they behave with a swarm behavior where they relate to each other model after insect swarm behavior and they could be make very numerous and so one can send a thousand of they as you can see in this upper left hand picture a thousand of they could fit into the payload bay that be use for one of the current MER Rovers and this little guy you could lose many of they if you send a thousand of they you could probably get rid of 90 percent of they and still have a mission and so that allow you the flexibility to go into very challenging terrain and actually make you way where you want to go now to wrap this up I want to talk for two second about cave and the human expansion beyond Earth as a natural outgrowth of the work that we do in cave it occur to we a number of year ago that cave have many property that person have use and other organism have use as habitat in the past and perhaps it be time we start to explore that in the context of future Mars and the Moon exploration so we have just finish a NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts Phase II study look at the irreducible set of technology that you would need in order to actually allow person to inhabit lava tube on the Moon or Mars it turn out to be a fairly simple and small list and we have go in the relatively primitive technology direction so we be talk about thing like inflatable liner that can conform to the complex topological shape on the inside of a cave foam in place airlock to deal with this complex topology various way of get breathe gas make from the intrinsic material of this body and the future be there for we to use this lava tube cave on Mars and right now we be in cave and we be do science and recreation but I think in the future we will be use they for habitat and science on this other body now my view of what the current status of potential life on Mars be that it be probably be on the planet maybe one in two chance the question as to whether there be life on Mars that be relate to life on Earth have now be very muddy because we now know from Mars meteorite that have make it to Earth that there be material that can be exchange between that two planet one of the burn question of course be if we go there and find life in the sub surface as I fully expect that we will be that a second genesis of life do life start here and be it transport there do it start there and get transport here this will be a fascinating puzzle as we go into the next half century and where I expect that we will have more and more Mars mission to answer this question thank you
