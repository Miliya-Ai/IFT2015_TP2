so I want to start out with this beautiful picture from my childhood I love the science fiction movie here it be this Island Earth and leave it to Hollywood to get it just right two and a half year in the make laughter I mean even the creationist give we 6 000 but Hollywood go to the chase and in this movie we see what we think be out there fly saucer and alien every world have a alien and every alien world have a fly saucer and they move about with great speed Aliens Well Don Brownlee my friend and I finally get to the point where we get tired of turn on the tv and see the spaceship and see the alien every night and try to write a counter argument to it and put out what do it really take for a Earth to be habitable for a planet to be a earth to have a place where you could probably get not just life but complexity which require a huge amount of evolution and therefore constancy of condition so in 2000 we write Rare Earth in 2003 we then ask let not think about where earth be in space but how long have Earth be Earth if you go back two billion year you be not on a earth like planet any more what we call a earth like planet be actually a very short interval of time well Rare Earth actually teach I a awful lot about meet the public right after I get a invitation to go to a science fiction convention and with all great earnestness walk in David Brin be go to debate I on this and as I walk in the crowd of a hundred start boo lustily I have a girl who come up who say my dad say you be the devil you can not take person alien away from they and expect to be anybody friend well the second part of that soon after and I be talk to Paul Allen I see he in the audience and I hand he a copy of Rare Earth and Jill Tarter be there and she turn to I and she look at I just like that girl in the Exorcist it be it burn it burn because setus do not want to hear this seti want there to be stuff out there I really applaud the SETI effort but we have not hear anything yet and I really do think we have to start think about what be a good planet and what be not now I throw this slide up because it indicate to I that even if SETI do hear something can we figure out what they say because this be a slide that be pass between the two major intelligence on Earth a Mac to a pc and it can not even get the letter right laughter so how be we go to talk to the alien and if they be 50 light year away and we call they up and you blah blah blah blah blah and then 50 year late it come back and they say please repeat I mean there we be we planet be a good planet because it can keep water Mars be a bad planet but it be still good enough for we to go there and to live on its surface if we be protect but Venus be a very bad the bad planet even though it be Earth like and even though early in its history it may very well have harbor earth like life it soon succumb to runaway greenhouse that be a 800 degree Fahrenheit surface because of rampant carbon dioxide well we know from astrobiology that we can really now predict what be go to happen to we particular planet we be right now in the beautiful Oreo of existence of at least life on Planet Earth follow the first horrible microbial age in the Cambrian explosion life emerge from the swamp complexity arise and from what we can tell we be halfway through we have as much time for animal to exist on this planet as they have be here now till we hit the second microbial age and that will happen paradoxically everything you hear about global warming when we hit co2 down to 10 part per million we be no long go to have to have plant that be allow to have any photosynthesis and there go animal so after that we probably have seven billion year the Sun increase in its intensity in its brightness and finally at about 12 billion year after it first start the Earth be consume by a large Sun and this be what be leave so a planet like we be go to have a age and a old age and we be in its golden summer age right now but there be two fate to everything be not there now a lot of you be go to die of old age but some of you horribly enough be go to die in a accident and that be the fate of a planet too Earth if we be lucky enough if it do not get hit by a Hale Bopp or get blast by some supernova nearby in the next seven billion year we will find under you foot but what about accidental death well paleontologist for the last 200 year have be chart death it be strange extinction as a concept be not even think about until Baron Cuvier in France find this first mastodon he could not match it up to any bone on the planet and he say aha it be extinct and very soon after the fossil record start yield a very good idea of how many plant and animal there have be since complex life really begin to leave a very interesting fossil record in that complex record of fossil there be time when lot of stuff seem to be die out very quickly and the father mother geologist call this mass extinction all along it be think to be either a act of God or perhaps long slow climate change and that really change in 1980 in this rocky outcrop near Gubbio where Walter Alvarez try to figure out what be the time difference between this white rock which hold creature of the cretaceous period and the pink rock above which hold tertiary fossil how long do it take to go from one system to the next and what they find be something unexpected they find in this gap in between a very thin clay layer and that clay layer this very thin red layer here be fill with iridium and not just iridium it be fill with glassy spherule and it be fill with quartz grain that have be subject to enormous pressure shock quartz now in this slide the white be chalk and this chalk be deposit in a warm ocean the chalk itself be compose by plankton which have fall down from the sea surface onto the sea floor so that 90 percent of the sediment here be skeleton of live stuff and then you have that millimeter thick red layer and then you have black rock and the black rock be the sediment on the sea bottom in the absence of plankton and that be what happen in a asteroid catastrophe because that be what this be of course this be the famous k t a 10 kilometer body hit the planet the effect of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet and we have very quickly the death of the dinosaur the death of this beautiful ammonite Leconteiceras here and Celaeceras over here and so much else I mean it must be true because we have have two Hollywood blockbuster since that time and this paradigm from 1980 to about 2000 totally change how we geologist think about catastrophe prior to that uniformitarianism be the dominant paradigm the fact that if anything happen on the planet in the past there be present day process that will explain it but we have not witness a big asteroid impact so this be a type of neo catastrophism and it take about 20 year for the scientific establishment to finally come to grip yes we be hit and yes the effect of that hit cause a major mass extinction well there be five major mass extinction over the last 500 million year call the big five they range from 450 million year ago to the last the k t number four but the big of all be the p or the Permian extinction sometimes call the mother of all mass extinction and every one of this have be subsequently blame on large body impact but be this true the most recent the Permian be think to have be a impact because of this beautiful structure on the right this be a Buckminsterfullerene a carbon 60 because it look like that terrible geodesic dome of my late beloved 60 they be call buckyball this evidence be use to suggest that at the end of the Permian 250 million year ago a comet hit we and when the comet hit the pressure produce the buckyball and it capture bit of the comet helium 3 very rare on the surface of the Earth very common in space but be this true in 1990 work on the k t extinction for 10 year I move to South Africa to begin work twice a year in the great Karoo desert I be so lucky to watch the change of that South Africa into the new South Africa as I go year by year and I work on this Permian extinction camping by this Boer graveyard for month at a time and the fossil be extraordinary you know you be gaze upon you very distant ancestor this be mammal like reptile they be culturally invisible we do not make movie about this this be a Gorgonopsian or a Gorgon that be a 18 inch long skull of a animal that be probably seven or eight foot sprawl like a lizard probably have a head like a lion this be the top carnivore the T Rex of its time but there be lot of stuff this be my poor son Patrick laughter this be call paleontological child abuse hold still you be the scale laughter there be big stuff back then fifty five species of mammal like reptile the age of mammal have well and truly start 250 million year ago and then a catastrophe happen and what happen next be the age of dinosaur it be all a mistake it should have never happen but it do now luckily this Thrinaxodon the size of a robin egg here this be a skull I have discover just before take this picture there be a pen for scale it be really tiny this be in the Lower Triassic after the mass extinction have finish you can see the eye socket and you can see the little tooth in the front if that do not survive I be not the thing give this talk something else be because if that do not survive we be not here there be no mammal it be that close one species eke through well can we say anything about the pattern of who survive and who do not here be sort of the end of that 10 year of work the range of stuff the red line be the mass extinction but we have get survivor and thing that get through and it turn out the thing that get through preferentially be cold blood warm blooded animal take a huge hit at this time the survivor that do get through produce this world of crocodile like creature there be no dinosaur yet just this slow saurian scaly nasty swampy place with a couple of tiny mammal hide in the fringe and there they would hide for 160 million year until liberate by that k t asteroid so if not impact what and the what I think be that we return over and over again to the Pre Cambrian world that first microbial age and the microbe be still out there they hate we animal they really want they world back and they have try over and over and over again this suggest to I that life cause this mass extinction because it do be inherently anti Gaian this whole Gaia idea that life make the world good for itself anybody be on a freeway on a Friday afternoon in Los Angeles believe in the Gaia theory no so I really suspect there be a alternative and that life do actually try to do itself in not consciously but just because it do and here be the weapon it seem that it do so over the last 500 million year there be microbe which through they metabolism produce hydrogen sulfide and they do so in large amount hydrogen sulfide be very fatal to we human as small as 200 part per million will kill you you only have to go to the Black Sea and a few other place some lake and get down and you will find that the water itself turn purple it turn purple from the presence of numerous microbe which have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide and we can detect they presence today we can see they but we can also detect they presence in the past and the last three year have see a enormous breakthrough in a brand new field I be almost extinct I be a paleontologist who collect fossil but the new wave of paleontologist my graduate student collect biomarker they take the sediment itself they extract the oil from it and from that they can produce compound which turn out to be very specific to particular microbial group it be because lipid be so tough they can get preserve in sediment and last the hundred of million of year necessary and be extract and tell we who be there and we know who be there at the end of the Permian at many of this mass extinction boundary this be what we find isorenieratene it be very specific it can only occur if the surface of the ocean have no oxygen and be totally saturate with hydrogen sulfide enough for instance to come out of solution this lead Lee Kump and other from Penn State and my group to propose what I call the Kump Hypothesis many of the mass extinction be cause by low oxygen by high co2 and the bad effect of global warm it turn out hydrogen sulfide be produce out of the ocean well what be the source of this in this particular case the source over and over have be flood basalt this be a view of the Earth now if we extract a lot of it and each of this look like a hydrogen bomb actually the effect be even bad this be when deep earth material come to the surface spread out over the surface of the planet well it be not the lava that kill anything it be the carbon dioxide that come out with it this be not Volvos this be volcano but carbon dioxide be carbon dioxide so this be new datum Rob Berner and I from Yale put together and what we try to do now be track the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record and we can do this from a variety of means and put all the red line here when this what I call greenhouse mass extinction take place and there be two thing that be really evident here to I be that this extinction take place when co2 be go up but the second thing that be not show on here the Earth have never have any ice on it when we have have 1 000 part per million co2 we be at 380 and climb we should be up to a thousand in three century at the most but my friend David Battisti in Seattle say he think a 100 year so there go the ice cap and there come 240 foot of sea level rise I live in a view house now I be go to have waterfront all right what be the consequence the ocean probably turn purple and we think this be the reason that complexity take so long to take place on planet earth we have this hydrogen sulfide ocean for a very great long period they stop complex life from exist we know hydrogen sulfide be erupt presently a few place on the planet and I throw this slide in this be I actually two month ago and I throw this slide in because here be my favorite animal chamber nautilus it be be on this planet since the animal first start 500 million year this be a tracking experiment and any of you scuba diver if you want to get involve in one of the cool project ever this be off the great barrier reef and as we speak now this nautilus be track out they behavior to we but the thing about this be that every once in a while we diver can run into trouble so I be go to do a little thought experiment here this be a great White Shark that eat some of my trap we pull it up up it come so it be out there with I at night so I be swim along and it take off my leg I be 80 mile from shore what be go to happen to I well now I die five year from now this be what I hope happen to I I be take back to the boat I be give a gas mask 80 part per million hydrogen sulfide I be then throw in a ice pond I be cool 15 degree low and I could be take to a critical care hospital and the reason I could do that be because we mammal have go through a series of this hydrogen sulfide event and we body have adapt and we can now use this as what I think will be a major medical breakthrough this be Mark Roth he be fund by DARPA try to figure out how to save American after battlefield injury he bleed out pig he put in 80 part per million hydrogen sulfide the same stuff that survive this past mass extinction and he turn a mammal into a reptile I believe we be see in this response the result of mammal and reptile have undergo a series of exposure to h2 I get this email from he two year ago he say I think I have get a answer to some of you question so he now have take mouse down for as many as four hour sometimes six hour and this be brand new datum he send I on the way over here on the top now that be a temperature record of a mouse who have go through the dot line the temperature so the temperature start at 25 centigrade and down it go down it go six hour later up go the temperature now the same mouse be give 80 part per million hydrogen sulfide in this solid graph and look what happen to its temperature its temperature drop it go down to 15 degree centigrade from 35 and come out of this perfectly fine here be a way we can get person to critical care here be how we can bring person cold enough to last till we get critical care now you be all think yeah what about the brain tissue and so this be one of the great challenge that be go to happen you be in a accident you have get two choice you be go to die or you be go to take the hydrogen sulfide and say 75 percent of you be save mentally what be you go to do do we all have to have a little button say let I die this be come towards we and I think this be go to be a revolution we be go to save life but there be go to be a cost to it the new view of mass extinction be yes we be hit and yes we have to think about the long term because we will get hit again but there be a far bad danger confront we we can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world give we a few millennia and we human should last that few millennium will it happen again if we continue it will happen again how many of we fly here how many of we have go through we entire Kyoto quota just for fly this year how many of you have exceed it yeah I have certainly exceed it we have a huge problem face we as a species we have to beat this I want to be able to go back to this reef thank you applause Chris Anderson I have just get one question for you Peter be I understand you right that what you be say here be that we have in we own body a biochemical response to hydrogen sulfide that in you mind prove that there have be past mass extinction due to climate change Peter Ward yeah every single cell in we can produce minute quantity of hydrogen sulfide in great crisis this be what Roth have find out so what we be look at now do it leave a signal do it leave a signal in bone or in plant and we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect how many of this have happen in the past CA it be simultaneously a incredible medical technique but also a terrifying PW blessing and curse
