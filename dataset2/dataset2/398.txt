I be go around the world give talk about Darwin and usually what I be talk about be Darwin strange inversion of reasoning now that title that phrase come from a critic a early critic and this be a passage that I just love and would like to read for you in the theory with which we have to deal absolute ignorance be the artificer so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system that in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine it be not requisite to know how to make it this proposition will be find on careful examination to express in condense form the essential purport of the theory and to express in a few word all Mr Darwin meaning who by a strange inversion of reasoning seem to think absolute ignorance fully qualified to take the place of Absolute Wisdom in the achievement of creative skill exactly exactly and it be a strange inversion a creationist pamphlet have this wonderful page in it test two do you know of any building that do not have a builder yes no do you know of any painting that do not have a painter yes no do you know of any car that do not have a maker yes no if you answer yes for any of the above give detail a ha I mean it really be a strange inversion of reasoning you would have think it stand to reason that design require a intelligent designer but Darwin show that it just false today though I be go to talk about Darwin other strange inversion which be equally puzzle at first but in some way just as important it stand to reason that we love chocolate cake because it be sweet guy go for girl like this because they be sexy we adore baby because they be so cute and of course we be amuse by joke because they be funny this be all backwards it be and Darwin show we why let start with sweet we sweet tooth be basically a evolve sugar detector because sugar be high energy and it just be wire up to the preferer to put it very crudely and that why we like sugar Honey be sweet because we like it not we like it because honey be sweet there nothing intrinsically sweet about honey if you look at glucose molecule till you be blind you would not see why they taste sweet you have to look in we brain to understand why they be sweet so if you think first there be sweetness and then we evolve to like sweetness you have get it backwards that just wrong it the other way round sweetness be bear with the wiring which evolve and there nothing intrinsically sexy about this young lady and it a good thing that there be not because if there be then Mother Nature would have a problem how on earth do you get chimp to mate now you might think ah there a solution hallucination that would be one way of do it but there a quick way just wire the chimp up to love that look and apparently they do that all there be to it over six million year we and the chimp evolve we different way we become bald bodied oddly enough for one reason or another they do not if we have not then probably this would be the height of sexiness we sweet tooth be a evolve and instinctual preference for high energy food it be not design for chocolate cake chocolate cake be a supernormal stimulus the term be owe to Niko Tinbergen who do he famous experiment with gull where he find that that orange spot on the gull beak if he make a big oranger spot the gull chick would peck at it even hard it be a hyperstimulus for they and they love it what we see with say chocolate cake be it a supernormal stimulus to tweak we design wiring and there be lot of supernormal stimulus chocolate cake be one there be lot of supernormal stimulus for sexiness and there be even supernormal stimulus for cuteness here a pretty good example it important that we love baby and that we not be put off by say messy diaper so baby have to attract we affection and we nurture and they do and by the way a recent study show that mother prefer the smell of the dirty diaper of they own baby so nature work on many level here but now if baby do not look the way they do if baby look like this that what we would find adorable that what we would find we would think oh my goodness do I ever want to hug that this be the strange inversion well now finally what about funny my answer be it the same story the same story this be the hard one the one that be not obvious that why I leave it to the end and I will not be able to say too much about it but you have to think evolutionarily you have to think what hard job that have to be do it dirty work somebody get to do it be so important to give we such a powerful inbuilt reward for it when we succeed now I think we have find the answer I and a few of my colleague it a neural system that wire up to reward the brain for do a grubby clerical job we bumper sticker for this view be that this be the joy of debug now I be not go to have time to spell it all out but I will just say that only some kind of debug get the reward and what we be do be we re use humor as a sort of neuroscientific probe by switch humor on and off by turn the knob on a joke now it not funny oh now it funny now we will turn a little bit more now it not funny in this way we can actually learn something about the architecture of the brain the functional architecture of the brain Matthew Hurley be the first author of this we call it the Hurley Model he a computer scientist Reginald Adams a psychologist and there I be and we be put this together into a book thank you very much
