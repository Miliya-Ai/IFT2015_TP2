sustainability represent the what the where and the how of what be catch the who and the why be what be important to I I want to know the person behind my dinner choice I want to know how I impact they I want to know how they impact I I want to know why they fish I want to know how they rely on the water bounty for they living understand all of this enable we to shift we perception of seafood away from a commodity to a opportunity to restore we ecosystem it allow for we to celebrate the seafood that we be also so fortunate to eat so what do we call this I think we call it restorative seafood where sustainability be the capacity to endure and maintain restorative be the ability to replenish and progress restorative seafood allow for a evolve and dynamic system and acknowledge we relationship with the ocean as a resource suggest that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency it be a more hopeful it be a more human and be a more useful way of understand we environment Wallet guide standard issue by lot in the marine conservation world be very handy they be a wonderful tool green yellow and red list of seafood species the association be very easy buy green do not buy red think twice about yellow but in my mind it be really not enough to just eat green list we can not sustain this without the measure of we success really change the fate of the species in the yellow and the red but what if we eat only in the green list you have get pole catch yellowfin tuna here come from sustainable stock Pole catch no bycatch great for fisherman lot of money support local economy but it be a lion of the sea it be a top predator what be the context of this meal be I sit down in a steakhouse to a 16 ounce portion of this do I do this three time a week I might still be in the green list but I be not do myself or you or the ocean any favor the point be that we have to have a context a gauge for we action in all this example I have hear that red wine be great for my health antioxidant and mineral heart healthy that be great I love red wine I be go to drink so much of it I be go to be so healthy well how many bottle be it before you tell I that I have a problem well folk we have a protein problem we have lose this sensibility when it regard we food and we be pay a cost the problem be we be hide that cost beneath the wave we be hide that cost behind the social acceptance of expand waistline and we be hide that cost behind monster profit so the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood be that it really take into account we need restorative seafood might best be represent not by Jaws or by Flipper or the Gordon fisherman but rather by the Jolly Green Giant vegetable they might yet save the ocean Sylvia like to say that blue be the new green well I would like to respectfully submit that broccoli green might then be the new blue we must continue to eat the good seafood possible if at all but we also must eat it with a ton of vegetable the good part about restorative seafood though be that it come on the half shell with a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedge it come in a five ounce portion of tilapia bread with dijon mustard and crispy broil breadcrumb and a steam pile of pecan quinoa pilaf with crunchy grill broccoli so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside with just a hint of chili flake Whooo this be a easy sell and the good part be all of that ingredient be available to every family at the neighborhood Walmart Jamie Oliver be campaign to save America from the way we eat Sylvia be campaign to save the ocean from the way we eat there be a pattern here forget nuclear holocaust it be the fork that we have to worry about we have ravage we Earth and then use the food that we have source to handicap ourselves in more way than one so I think we have this whole eating thing wrong and so I think it be time we change what we expect from we food sustainability be complicated but dinner be a reality that we all very much understand so let start there there be be a lot of movement recently in greening we food system Dan Barber and Alice Waters be lead passionately the green food Delicious Revolution but green food often represent a way for we to disregard the responsibility as eater just because it come from a green source do not mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate we have eco friendly shrimp we can make they we have that technology but we can never have any eco friendly all you can eat shrimp buffet it do not work Heart healthy dinner be a very important part of restorative seafood while we try to manage decline marine population the media recommend increase consumption of seafood study say that ten of thousand of American grandmother grandfather mother and father might be around for another birthday if we include more seafood that be a reward I be not willing to pass up but it be not all about the seafood it be about the way that we look at we plate as a chef I realize the easy thing for I to do be reduce the portion size on my plate a couple thing happen I make more money person start buy appetizer and salad because they know they be not go to fill up on the entree alone person spend more time engage in they meal engage with each other over they meal person get in short more of what they come there for even though they get less protein they get more calorie over the course of a diversified meal they get healthy I make more money this be great environmental consideration be serve with every plate but it be serve with a heap mound of consideration for human interest at the same time one of the other thing we do be begin to diversify the species that we serve small silverfish anchovy mackerel sardine be uncommon shellfish mussel oyster clam tilapia char this be the common species we be direct taste towards more resilience more restorative option this be what we need to favor this be what the green list say but this be also how we can actually begin to restore we environment but what of that big predator that fashionable species that green list tuna that I be talk about early well if you must I have a recipe for you it pretty much work with any big fish in the ocean so here we go start with a 16 ounce portion of big fish get a knife cut it into four portion put it on four plate mound up that four plate with vegetable and then open up the very good bottle of Burgundy you have light the candle and celebrate it celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this invite you friend and neighbor over and repeat once a year maybe I expect a lot from food I expect health and joy and family and community I expect that produce ingredient prepare dish and eat meal be all part of the communion of human interest I be lucky enough that my father be a fantastic cook and he teach I very early on about the privilege that eat represent I remember well the meal of my childhood they be reasonable portion of protein serve with copious quantity of vegetable and small amount of starch usually rice this be still how I largely eat today I get sick when I go to steakhouse I get the meat sweat it be like a hangover from protein it be disgusting but of all the dire news that you will hear and that you have hear about the state of we ocean I have the unfortunate burden of deliver to you possibly the very bad of it and that be this whole time you mother be right eat you vegetable it be pretty straightforward so what be we look for in a meal well for health I be look for wholesome ingredient that be good for my body for joy I be look for butter and salt and sexy thing that make thing taste less like penance for family I be look for recipe that genuflect to my own personal history for community though we start at the very beginning there be no escape the fact that everything we eat have a global impact so try and learn as good you can what that impact be and then take the first step to minimize it we have see a image of we blue planet we world bank but it be more than just a repository of we resource it be also the global geography of the communion we call dinner so if we all take only what we need then we can begin to share the rest we can begin to celebrate we can begin to restore we need to savor vegetable we need to savor small portion of seafood and we need to save dinner thank you
