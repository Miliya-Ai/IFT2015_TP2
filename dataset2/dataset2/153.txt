I would like to do pretty much what I do the first time which be to choose a light hearted theme last time I talk about death and die this time I be go to talk about mental illness but it have to be technological so I will talk about electroshock therapy laughter you know ever since man have any notion that some of he other person he colleague could be different could be strange could be severely depressed or what we now recognize as schizophrenia he be certain that this kind of illness have to come from evil spirit get into the body so the way of treat this disease in early time be to in some way or other exorcise that evil spirit and this be still go on as you know but it be not enough to use the priest when medicine become somewhat scientific in about 450 bc with Hippocrates and that boy they try to look for herb plant that would literally shake the bad spirit out so they find certain plant that could cause convulsion and the herbal the botanical book of up to the late Middle Ages the Renaissance be fill with prescription for cause convulsion to shake the evil spirit out finally in about the sixteenth century a physician whose name be Theophrastus Bombastus Aureolus von Hohenheim call Paracelsus a name probably familiar to some person here laughter good old Paracelsus find that he could predict the degree of convulsion by use a measure amount of camphor to produce the convulsion can you imagine go to you closet pull out a mothball and chew on it if you be feel depressed it be good than Prozac but I would not recommend it so what we see in the seventeenth eighteenth century be the continue search for medication other than camphor that will do the trick well along come Benjamin Franklin and he come close to convulse himself with a bolt of electricity off the end of he kite and so person begin think in term of electricity to produce convulsion and then we fast forward to about 1932 when three Italian psychiatrist who be largely treat depression begin to notice among they patient who be also epileptic that if they have a epileptic a series of epileptic fit a lot of they in a row the depression would very frequently lift not only would it lift but it might never return so they get very interested in produce convulsion measure type of convulsion and they think well we have get electricity we will plug somebody into the wall that always make hair stand up and person shake a lot so they try it on a few pig and none of the pig be kill so they go to the police and they say we know that at the Rome railroad station there be all this lose soul wander around mutter gibberish can you bring one of they to we someone who be as the Italian say cagoot so they find this cagoots guy a 39 year old man who be really hopelessly schizophrenic who be know have be know for month to be literally defecate on himself talk nothing that make any sense and they bring he into the hospital so this three psychiatrist after about two or three week of observation lay he down on a table connect he temple to a very small source of current they think well we will try 55 volt two tenth of a second that be not go to do anything terrible to he so they do that well I have the follow from a firsthand observer who tell I this about 35 year ago when I be think about this thing for some research project of mine he say this fellow remember he be not even put to sleep after this major grand mal convulsion sit right up look at this three fella and say what the fuck be you asshole try to do laughter if I could only say that in Italian well they be happy as could be because he have not say a rational word in the week of observation so they plug he in again and this time they use 110 volt for half a second and to they amazement after it be over he begin speak like he be perfectly well he relapse a little bit they give he a series of treatment and he be essentially cure but of course have schizophrenia within a few month it return but they write a paper about this and everybody in the western world begin use electricity to convulse person who be either schizophrenic or severely depressed it do not work very well on the schizophrenic but it be pretty clear in the 30 and by the middle of the 40 that electroconvulsive therapy be very very effective in the treatment of depression and of course in that day there be no antidepressant drug and it become very very popular they would anesthetize person convulse they but the real difficulty be that there be no way to paralyze muscle so person would have a real grand mal seizure Bones be break especially in old fragile person you could not use it and then in the 1950 late 1950 the so call muscle relaxant be develop by pharmacologist and it get so that you could induce a complete convulsion a electroencephalographic convulsion you could see it on the brain wave without cause any convulsion in the body except a little bit of twitching of the toe so again it be very very popular and very very useful well you know in the middle 60 the first antidepressant come out Tofranil be the first in the late 70 early 80 there be other and they be very effective and patient right group seem to get very upset about the kind of thing that they would witness and so the whole idea of electroconvulsive electroshock therapy disappear but have have a renaissance in the last 10 year and the reason that it have have a renaissance be that probably about 10 percent of the person severe depressive do not respond regardless of what be do for they now why be I tell you this story at this meeting I be tell you this story because actually ever since Richard call I and ask I to talk about as he ask all of he speaker to talk about something that would be new to this audience that we have never talk about never write about I have be plan this moment this reason really be that I be a man who almost 30 year ago have he life save by two long course of electroshock therapy and let I tell you this story I be in the 1960 in a marriage to use the word bad would be perhaps the understatement of the year it be dreadful there be I be sure enough divorced person in this room to know about the hostility the anger who know what be someone who have have a very difficult childhood a very difficult adolescence it have to do with not quite poverty but close it have to do with be bring up in a family where no one speak English no one could read or write English it have to do with death and disease and lot of other thing I be a little prone to depression so as thing get bad as we really begin to hate each other I become progressively depress over a period of a couple of year try to save this marriage which be inevitably not to be save finally I would schedule all my major surgical case I be schedule they for 12 one o clock in the afternoon because I could not get out of bed before about 11 o clock and anybody who be be depress here know what that be like I could not even pull the cover off myself well you be in a university medical center where everybody know everybody and it be perfectly clear to my colleague so my referral begin to decrease as my referral begin to decrease I clearly become increasingly depressed until I think my God I can not work anymore and in fact it do not make any difference because I do not have any patient anymore so with the advice of my physician I have myself admit to the acute care psychiatric unit of we university hospital and my colleague who have know I since medical school in that place say do not worry chap six week you be back in the operating room everything be go to be great well you know what bovine stercus be that prove to be a lot of bovine stercus I know some person who get tenure in that place with lie like that laughter so I be one of they failure but it be not that simple because by the time I get out of that unit I be not functional at all I could hardly see five foot in front of myself I shuffle when I walk I be bow over I rarely bath I sometimes do not shave it be dreadful and it be clear not to I because nothing be clear to I at that time anymore that I would need long term hospitalization in that awful place call a mental hospital so I be admit in 1973 in the spring of 1973 to the Institute of live which use to be call the Hartford Retreat it be found in the eighteenth century the large psychiatric hospital in the state of Connecticut other than the huge public hospital that exist at that time and they try everything they have they try the usual psychotherapy they try every medication available in that day and they do have Tofranil and other thing Mellaril who know what nothing happen except that I get jaundiced from one of this thing and finally because I be well know in Connecticut they decide they well have a meeting of the senior staff all the senior staff get together and I later find out what happen they put all they head together and they decide that there be nothing that could be do for this surgeon who have essentially separate himself from the world who by that time have become so overwhelmed not just with depression and feeling of worthlessness and inadequacy but with obsessional thinking obsessional thinking about coincidence and there be particular number that every time I see they just get I dreadfully upset all kind of ritualistic observance just awful awful stuff remember when you be a kid and you have to step on every line well I be a grown man who have all of this ritual and it get so there be a throb there be a ferocious fear in my head you have see this painting by Edvard Munch the Scream every moment be a scream it be impossible so they decide there be no therapy there be no treatment but there be one treatment which actually have be pioneer at the Hartford hospital in the early 1940 and you can imagine what it be it be pre frontal lobotomy so they decide I do not know this again I find this out later that the only thing that could be do be for this 43 year old man to have a pre frontal lobotomy well as in all hospital there be a resident assign to my case he be 27 year old and he would meet with I two or three time a week and of course I have be there what three or four month at the time and he ask to meet with the senior staff and they agree to meet with he because he be very well think of in that place they think he have a really extraordinary future and he dig in he heel and say no I know this man good than any of you I have meet with he over and over again you have just see he from time to time you have read report and so forth I really honestly believe that the basic problem here be pure depression and all of the obsessional thinking come out of it and you know of course what will happen if you do a pre frontal lobotomy any of the result along the spectrum from pretty bad to terrible terrible terrible be go to happen if he do the good he can he will have no further obsession probably no depression but he affect will be dull he will never go back to surgery he will never be the love father that he be to he two child he life will be change if he have the usual result he will end up like one fly over the cuckoo nest and you know about that just essentially in a stupor the rest of he life well he say can not we try a course of electroshock therapy and you know why they agree they agree to humor he they just think well we will give a course of 10 and so we will lose a little time big deal it do not make any difference so they give the course of 10 and the first the usual course incidentally be six to eight and still be six to eight plug I into the wire put I to sleep give I the muscle relaxant six do not work seven do not work eight do not work at nine I notice and it be wonderful that I could notice anything I notice a change and at 10 I notice a real change and he go back to they and they agree to do another 10 again not a single one of they I think there be about seven or eight of they think this would do any good they think this be a temporary change but lo and behold by 16 by 17 there be demonstrable difference in the way I feel by 18 and 19 I be sleep through the night and by 20 I have the sense I really have the sense that I could overcome this that I be now strong enough that by a act of will I could blow the obsessional thinking away I could blow the depression away and I have never forget I never will forget stand in the kitchen of the unit it be a Sunday morning in January of 1974 stand in the kitchen by myself and think I have get the strength now to do this it be as though that tightly coil wire in my head have be disconnect and I could think clearly but I need a formula I need some thing to say to myself when I begin think obsessionally obsessively well the Gilbert and Sullivan fan in this room will remember Ruddigore and they will remember mad Margaret and they will remember that she be marry to a fellow name Sir Despard Murgatroyd and she use to go nuts every five minute or so in the play and he say to she we must have a word to bring you back to reality and the word my dear will be Basingstoke so every time she get a little nut he would say Basingstoke and she would say Basingstoke it be and she would be fine for a little while well you know I be from the Bronx I can not say Basingstoke but I have something good and it be very simple it be ah fuck it laughter much good than Basingstoke at least for I and it work my God it work every time I would begin think obsessionally again once more after 20 shock treatment I would say ah fuck it and thing get good and good and within three or four month I be discharge from that hospital and I join a group of surgeon where I could work with other person in the community not in New Haven but fairly close by I stay there for three year at the end of three year I go back to New Haven have remarry by that time I bring my wife with I actually to make sure I could get through this my child come back to live with we we have two more child after that resuscitate the career even good than it have be before go right back into the university and begin to write book well you know it be be a wonderful life it be be as I say close to 30 year I stop do surgery about six year ago and become a full time writer as many person know but it be be very exciting it be be very happy every once in a while I have to say ah fuck it every once in a while I get somewhat depressed and a little obsessional so I be not free of all of this but it be work it be always work why have I choose after never ever talk about this to talk about it now well that of you who know some of this book know that one be about death and die one be about the human body and the human spirit one be about the way mystical thought be constantly in we mind and they have always to do with my own personal experience one might think read this book and I have get thousand of letter about they by person who do think this that base on my life history as I have portray in the book my early life history I be someone who have overcome adversity that I be someone who have drunk drink drunk of the bitter dregs of near disaster in childhood and emerge not just unscathed but strengthen I really have it figure out so that I can advise person about death and die so that I can talk about mysticism and the human spirit and I have always feel guilty about that I have always feel that somehow I be a impostor because my reader do not know what I have just tell you it be know by some person in New Haven obviously but it be not generally know so one of the reason that I have come here to talk about this today be to frankly selfishly unburden myself and let it be know that this be not a untroubled mind that have write all of this book but more importantly I think be the fact that a very significant proportion of person in this audience be under 30 and there be many of course who be well over 30 for person under 30 and it look to I like almost all of you I would say all of you be either on the cusp of a magnificent and exciting career or right into a magnificent and exciting career anything can happen to you Things change accident happen something from childhood come back to haunt you you can be throw off the track I hope it happen to none of you but it will probably happen to a small percentage of you to that to whom it do not happen there will be adversity if I with the bleakness of spirit with no spirit that I have in the 1970 and no possibility of recovery as far as that group of very experienced psychiatrist think if I can find my way back from this believe I anybody can find they way back from any adversity that exist in they life and for that who be old who have live through perhaps not something as bad as this but who have live through difficult time perhaps where they lose everything as I do and start out all over again some of this thing will seem very familiar there be recovery there be redemption and there be resurrection there be resurrection theme in every society that have ever be study and it be because not just only do we fantasize about the possibility of resurrection and recovery but it actually happen and it happen a lot perhaps the most popular resurrection theme outside of specifically religious one be the one about the phoenix the ancient story of the phoenix who every 500 year resurrect itself from its own ash to go on to live a life that be even more beautiful than it be before Richard thanks very much
