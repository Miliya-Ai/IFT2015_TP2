Frank Gehry I listen to this scientist this morning Dr Mullis be talk about he experiment and I realize that I almost become a scientist when I be 14 my parent buy I a chemistry set and I decide to make water laughter so I make a hydrogen generator and I make a oxygen generator and I have the two pipe lead into a beaker and I throw a match in laughter and the glass luckily I turn around I have it all in my back and I be about 15 foot away the wall be cover with I have a explosion Richard Saul Wurman really FG People on the street come and knock on the door to see if I be okay rsw huh laughter I would like to start this session again the gentleman to my left be the very famous perhaps overly famous Frank Gehry laughter applause and Frank you have come to a place in you life which be astonishing I mean it be astonishing for a artist for a architect to become actually a icon and a legend in they own time I mean you have become whether you can giggle at it because it be a funny you know it be a strange thought but you building be a icon you can draw a little picture of that building it can be use in ad and you have have not rock star status but celebrity status in do what you want to do for most of you life and I know the road be extremely difficult and it do not seem at least that you sell out whatever they be be very big you keep move ahead in a life where you be dependent on work for somebody but that be a interesting thing for a creative person a lot of we work for person we be in the hand of other person and that be one of the great dilemma we be in a creativity session it be one of the great dilemma in creativity how to do work that big enough and not sell out and you have achieve that and that make you win doubly big triply big it be not quite a question but you can comment on it it be a big issue FG well I have always just I have never really go out look for work I always wait for it to sort of hit I on the head and when I start out I think that architecture be a service business and that you have to please the client and stuff and I realize when I would come into the meeting with this corrugated metal and chain link stuff and person would just look at I like I would just land from Mars but I could not do anything else that be my response to the person in the time and actually it be respond to client that I have who do not have very much money so they could not afford very much I think it be circumstantial until I get to my house where the client be my wife we buy this tiny little bungalow in Santa Monica and for like 50 grand I build a house around it and a few person get excited about it I be visit with a artist Michael Heizer out in the desert near Las Vegas somewhere he be build this huge concrete place and it be late in the evening we have have a lot to drink we be stand out in the desert all alone and think about my house he say do it ever occur to you if you build stuff more permanent somewhere in 2000 year somebody be go to like it laughter so I think yeah that be probably a good idea luckily I start to get some client that have a little more money so the stuff be a little more permanent but I just find out the world be not go to last that long this guy be tell we the other day so where do we go now back to everything so temporary I do not see it the way you characterize it for I every day be a new thing I approach each project with a new insecurity almost like the first project I ever do and I get the sweat I go in and start work I be not sure where I be go if I know where I be go I would not do it when I can predict or plan it I do not do it I discard it so I approach it with the same trepidation obviously over time I have a lot more confidence that it be go to be ok I do run a kind of a business I have get 120 person and you have get to pay they so there be a lot of responsibility involve but the actual work on the project be with I think a healthy insecurity and like the playwright say the other day I could relate to he you be not sure when Bilbao be finish and I look at it I see all the mistake I see they be not mistake I see everything that I would have change and I be embarrassed by it I feel a embarrassment how could I have do that how could I have make shape like that or do stuff like that it be take several year to now look at it detach and say as you walk around the corner and a piece of it work with the road and the street and it appear to have a relationship that I start to like it RSW what be the status of the New York project FG I do not really know Tom Krens come to I with Bilbao and explain it all to I and I think he be nuts I do not think he know what he be do and he pull it off so I think he be Icarus and Phoenix all in one guy laughter he get up there and then he come back up they be still talk about it September 11 generate some interest in move it over to Ground Zero and I be totally against that I just feel uncomfortable talk about or build anything on Ground Zero I think for a long time RSW the picture on the screen be that Disney FG yeah RSW how much further along be it than that and when will that be finish FG that will be finish in 2003 September October and I be hope Kyu and Herbie and Yo Yo and all that guy come play with we at that place luckily today most of the person I be work with be person I really like Richard Koshalek be probably one of the main reason that Disney Hall come to I he be be a cheerleader for quite a long time there be not many person around that be really involve with architecture as client if you think about the world and even just in this audience most of we be involve with building nothing that you would call architecture right and so to find one a guy like that you hang on to he he be become the head of Art Center and there be a building by Craig Ellwood there I know Craig and respect he they want to add to it and it be hard to add to a building like that it be a beautiful minimalist black steel building and Richard want to add a library and more student stuff and it be a lot of acreage I convince he to let I bring in another architect from Portugal Alvaro Siza RSW why do you want that fg I know you would ask that question it be intuitive laughter Alvaro Siza grow up and live in Portugal and be probably consider the Portuguese main guy in architecture I visit with he a few year ago and he show I he early work and he early work have a resemblance to my early work when I come out of college I start to try to do thing contextually in Southern California and you get into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roof and thing like that I try to understand that language as a beginning as a place to jump off and there be so much of it be do by spec builder and it be trivialize so much that it be not I just stop I mean Charlie Moore do a bunch of it but it do not feel good to I Siza on the other hand continue in Portugal where the real stuff be and evolve a modern language that relate to that historic language and I always feel that he should come to Southern California and do a building I try to get he a couple of job and they do not pan out I like the idea of collaboration with person like that because it push you I have do it with Claes Oldenburg and with Richard Serra who do not think architecture be art do you see that thing RSW No what do he say FG he call architecture plumbing laughter fg anyway the Siza thing it be a rich experience it must be like that for Kyu do thing with musician it be similar to that I would imagine where you huh Audience Liquid architecture FG Liquid architecture laughter where you it be like jazz you improvise you work together you play off each other you make something they make something and I think for I it be a way of try to understand the city and what might happen in the city rsw be it go to be near the current campus or be it go to be down near FG No it be near the current campus anyway he be that kind of patron it be not he money of course laughter RSW what be he schedule on that fg I do not know what be the schedule Richard Richard Koshalek Unclear start from 2004 FG 2004 you can come to the opening I will invite you no but the issue of city building in democracy be interesting because it create chaos right everybody do they thing make a very chaotic environment and if you can figure out how to work off each other if you can get a bunch of person who respect each other work and play off each other you might be able to create model for how to build section of the city without resort to the one architect like the Rockefeller Center model which be kind of from another era rsw I find the most remarkable thing my preconception of Bilbao be this wonderful building you go inside and there would be extraordinary space I would see drawing you have present here at TED the surprise of Bilbao be in its context to the city that be the surprise of go across the river of go on the highway around it of walk down the street and find it that be the real surprise of Bilbao FG but you know Richard most architect when they present they work most of the person we know you get up and you talk about you work and it be almost like you tell everybody you be a good guy by say look I be worried about the context I be worried about the city I be worried about my client I worry about budget that I be on time blah blah blah and all that stuff and it be like cleanse yourself so that you can by say all that it mean you work be good somehow and I think everybody I mean that should be a matter of fact like gravity you be not go to defy gravity you have get to work with the building department if you do not meet the budget you be not go to get much work if it leak Bilbao do not leak I be so proud laughter the MIT project they be interview I for MIT and they send they facility person to Bilbao I meet they in Bilbao they come for three day rsw this be the computer build FG yeah the computer building they be there three day and it rain every day and they keep walk around I notice they be look under thing and look for thing and they want to know where the bucket be hide you know person put bucket out I be clean there be not a bloody leak in the place it be just fantastic but you have get to yeah well up until then every building leak so this laughter RSW Frank have a sort of FG ask Miriam RW sort of have a fame he fame be build on that in l a for a while laughter FG you have all hear the Frank Lloyd Wright story when the woman call and say Mr Wright I be sit on the couch and the water pour in on my head and he say Madam move you chair laughter so some year later I be do a build a little house on the beach for Norton Simon and he secretary who be kind of a hell on wheel type lady call I and say Mr Simon sit at he desk and the water come in on he head and I tell she the Frank Lloyd Wright story RSW do not get a laugh FG No not now either laughter but my point be that and I call it the then what ok you solve all the problem you do all the stuff you make nice you love you client you love the city you be a good guy you be a good person and then what what do you bring to it and I think that be what I have always be interested in be that which be a personal kind of expression Bilbao I think show that you can have that kind of personal expression and still touch all the basis that be necessary of fit into the city that be what remind I of it and I think that be the issue you know it be the then what that most client who hire architect most client be not hire architect for that they be hire they to get it do get it on budget be polite and they be miss out on the real value of a architect RSW at a certain point a number of year ago person when Michael Graves be a fashion before teapot FG I do a teapot and nobody buy it laughter rsw do it leak FG no laughter rsw person want a Michael Graves building be that a curse that person want a Bilbao building FG yeah since Bilbao open which be now four five year both Krens and I have be call with at least 100 opportunity China Brazil other part of Spain to come in and do the Bilbao effect and I have meet with some of this person usually I say no right away but some of they come with pedigree and they sound well intention and they get you for at least one or two meeting in one case I fly all the way to Malaga with a team because the thing be sign with seal and various very official seal from the city and that they want I to come and do a building in they port I ask they what kind of build it be when you get here we will explain it Blah blah blah so four of we go and they take we they put we up in a great hotel and we be look over the bay and then they take we in a boat out in the water and show we all this sight in the harbor each one be more beautiful than the other and then we be go to have lunch with the mayor and we be go to have dinner with the most important person in Malaga just before go to lunch with the mayor we go to the harbor commissioner it be a table as long as this carpet and the harbor commissioner be here and I be here and my guy we sit down and we have a drink of water and everybody be quiet and the guy look at I and say now what can I do for you Mr Gehry laughter RSW oh my God FG so I get up I say to my team let get out of here we stand up we walk out they follow the guy that drag we there follow we and he say you mean you be not go to have lunch with the mayor I say nope you be not go to have dinner at all they just bring we there to hustle this group you know to create a project and we get a lot of that luckily I be old enough that I can complain I can not travel laughter I do not have my own plane yet RSW well I be go to wind this up and wind up the meeting because it be be very long but let I just say a couple word FG can I say something be you go to talk about I or you laughter applause rsw once a shit always a shit FG because I want to get
