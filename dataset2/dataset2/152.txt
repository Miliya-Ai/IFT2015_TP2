you know there be a small country nestle in the Himalayan Mountains far from this beautiful mountain where the person of the Kingdom of Bhutan have decide to do something different which be to measure they gross national happiness rather than they gross national product and why not after all happiness be not just a privilege for the lucky few but a fundamental human right for all and what be happiness happiness be the freedom of choice the freedom to choose where to live what to do what to buy what to sell from whom to whom when and how where do choice come from and who get to express it and how do we express it well one way to express choice be through the market well function market provide choice and ultimately the ability to express one pursuit for happiness the great Indian economist Amartya Sen be award the Nobel prize for demonstrate that famine be not so much about the availability of food supply but rather the ability to acquire or entitle oneself to that food through the market in 1984 in what can only be consider one of the great crime of humanity nearly one million person die of starvation in my country of birth Ethiopia not because there be not enough food because there be actually a surplus of food in the fertile region of the south part of the country but because in the north person could not access or entitle themselves to that food that be a turning point for my life most African today by far be farmer and most of Africa farmer be by and large small farmer in term of land that they operate and very very small farmer in term of the capital they have at they disposal African agriculture today be among or be the most under capitalized in the world only seven percent of arable land in Africa be irrigate compare to 40 percent in Asia African farmer only use some 22 kilogram of fertilizer per hectare compare to 144 in Asia Road density be six time great in Asia than it be in rural Africa there be eight time more tractor in Latin America and three time more tractor in Asia than in Africa the small farmer in Africa today live a life without much choice and therefore without much freedom he livelihood be predetermine by the condition of grind poverty he come to the market when price be low with the meager fruit of he hard labor just after the harvest because he have no choice she come back to the market some month later when price be high in what we call the lean season when food be scarce because she have to feed she family and have no choice the real question be how can market be develop in rural Africa to harness the power of innovation and entrepreneurship that we know exist another notable economist Theodore Schultz in 1974 win the Nobel prize for demonstrate that farmer be efficient but poor mean in fact that farmer be rational and profit minded just like everybody else well we do not need now any more Nobel prize to know that farmer want a fair shake at the market and want to make money just like everyone else and one thing be clear which be at least now we know that Africa be open for business and that business be agriculture over two decade ago the world insist to Africa that market must be liberalize that economy must be structurally adjust this mean that government be to remove themselves from the business of buying and selling which they do rather inefficiently and let the private market do its magic well what happen over the last 25 year do Africa feed itself do we farmer turn into highly productive commercial actor I think we be all in this room probably because we know that in fact Africa be the only region in the world where hunger and malnutrition be project to go up over the next 10 year where the food import bill be now double what it be 20 year ago where food production per capita have stagnate and where fertilizer use have decline rather than increase so why do not agriculture market perform to expectation the market reform prompt by the West and I have spend some 15 year travel around the continent do research on agricultural market and have interview trader in 10 to 15 country in this continent hundred of trader try to understand what go wrong with we market reform and it seem to I that the reform might have throw the baby out with the bath water like its agriculture Africa market be highly under capitalized and inefficient we know from we work around the continent that transaction cost of reach the market and the risk of transact in rural agriculture market be extremely high in fact only one third of agricultural output produce in Africa even reach the market Africa market be weak not only because of weak infrastructure in term of road and telecommunications but also because of the virtual absence of necessary market institution such as market information grade and standard and reliable way to connect buyer and seller because of this commodity buyer and seller typically transact in small circle in narrow network of person they know and trust and because of that as grain change hand and I have measure that it change hand four five time in its trajectory from the farmer to the consumer every time it change hand and I have see this all over rural Africa it also change sack and I think that be incredibly peculiar and really realize that that be because as trader would tell I over and over that be the only way person know what they be get in term of the quantity and the product quality and that actually have huge implication for the ability of market to quickly respond to price signal and situation where there be deficit for example it also have very high cost implication I have measure that 26 percent of the marketing margin be simply due to the fact that because of the absence of grade and standard and market information sack have to be constantly change and this lead to very high handling cost for they part small farmer who produce the bulk of we agricultural output in Africa come to the market with virtually no information at all blind trust that they be go to have some sort of demand for they produce and completely at the mercy of the merchant in the only market the near local market they know where they be unable to negotiate good price or reduce they risk speak of risk we have see that price volatility of food crop in Africa be the high in the world in Africa small farmer bear the brunt of this risk in fact in my view there be no region of the world and no period in history that farmer have be expect to bear the kind of market risk that Africa farmer have to bear and in my view there be simply no place in the world that have grow its agriculture on the kind of risk that we farmer in Africa today face in Ethiopia for example the variation in maize price from year to year be as much as 50 percent annually this kind of market risk be mind boggle and have direct implication for not only the incentive of farmer to invest in high productivity technology such as modern seed and fertilizer but also direct implication for food security to give you a example between 2001 and 2002 Ethiopian maize farmer produce two year of bumper harvest that in turn because of the weak marketing system lead to a 80 percent collapse in maize price in the country this make it unprofitable for some farmer to even harvest the grain from the field and we calculate that some 300 000 ton of grain be leave in the field to rot in early 2002 not six month later in July 2002 Ethiopia announce a major food crisis to the same proportion as 1984 14 million person at risk of starvation what also happen that year be in the area where there be good rain and where farmer have previously produce surplus grain farmer have decide to withdraw from the fertilizer market not use fertilizer and actually have drop they use of fertilizer by 27 percent this be a tragic example of arrest development or a budding green revolution stop in its track and this be not just specific to Ethiopia but happen over and over all over Africa well I be not here today to lament about the situation or wring my hand I be here to tell you that change be in the air Africa today be not the Africa wait for aid solution or cookie cutter foreign expert policy prescription Africa have learn or be learn somewhat slowly that market do not happen by themselves in the 1980 it be very fashionable to talk about get price right there be a very influential book about that which be mainly about get government out of the market we now recognize that get market right be about not just price incentive but also invest in the right infrastructure and the appropriate and necessary institution to create the condition to unleash the power of innovation in the market when condition be right we know and see that that innovation be ready to explode in rural Africa just like anywhere else nearly three year ago I decide to leave my comfortable job as a World Bank senior economist in Washington and come back to my country of birth Ethiopia after nearly 30 year abroad I do so for a simple reason after have spend more than a decade understanding study and try to convince policymaker and donor about what be wrong with Africa agricultural market I decide it be time to do something about it I currently lead in Ethiopia a exciting new initiative to establish the first Ethiopia Commodity Exchange or ECX now the commodity exchange itself that concept be not new to the world in fact in 1848 82 grain merchant and farmer get together in a small town at the crossroads of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan to establish a way to trade good amongst themselves that be of course the birth of the Chicago Board of Trade which be the most famous commodity exchange in the world the Chicago Board of Trade be establish then for precisely the same reason that we farmer today would benefit from a commodity exchange in the American Midwest farmer use to load grain onto barge and send it upriver to the Chicago market but once it arrive if no buyer be to be find or if price suddenly drop farmer would incur tremendous loss and in fact would even dump the grain in Lake Michigan rather than spend more money transport it back to they farm well the need to avoid this huge risk and tremendous loss lead to the birth of the future market and the underlie system of grade grain and receipt issue warehouse receipt on the basis of which trade could be do from there the great innovation of all come about in this market which be that buyer and seller could transact grain without actually have to physically or visually inspect the grain that mean that grain could be trade across tremendous distance and even across time as far forward as 18 month into the future this innovation be at the heart of the transformation of American agriculture and the rise of Chicago to a global market agricultural market superpower from where it be a small regional town now over the last century we tend to think of commodity exchange as the purview of western industrialize country and that the reference price for cotton coffee cocoa product produce mainly in the south be actually a reference price or a price discover in this organize commodity exchange in the northern country but that be actually change and we be see a shift power mainly because of information technology a shift in market dominance towards the emerge market and over the last decade you see that the share of western exchange and this be the U S share of exchange in the world have go down by nearly half in just the last decade similarly there be be explosive growth in India for example where rural farmer be use exchange grow here over the last three year by 270 percent a year this be power by low cost vsat technology aggressively try to reach farmer to bring they into the market China Dalian Commodity Exchange three year ago 2004 overtake the Chicago Board of Trade to become the second large commodity exchange in the world now in Ethiopia we be in the process of design the first organized Ethiopia Commodity Exchange we be not try to cut and paste the Chicago model or the India model but create a system uniquely tailor to Ethiopia need and reality Ethiopia small farmer so the ECX be a Ethiopian exchange for Ethiopia we be create a system that serve all market actor that create integrity trust efficiency transparency and enable small farmer to manage the risk that I have describe in the design of we commodity exchange in Ethiopia we have do something rather unique which be to take the approach of a integrate perspective or what we call the ECX Edge the ECX Edge pretty much create the entire ecosystem in which the market will develop itself and this be because one of the thing we have learn over the last decade of study market development in Africa be that the piecemeal approach do not work you have get one donor try to develop market information another try to work on or sponsor grade and standard another ict and yet another on warehousing or warehouse receipt in we approach in Ethiopia we have decide to put together the entire ecosystem or environment in which trade take place that mean that the exchange will operate a trading system which will initially start as a open outcry because we do not think the country ready for full electronic trading but at the same time we will do something which I think no exchange in the world have ever do which be itself to operate something like a internet cafe in the rural area so that farmer and small trader can actually come to a terminal center what we call the remote access terminal center and actually without have to buy a computer or figure out how to dial up or any of that thing simply see the trading that be happen on the Addis Ababa trading floor at the same time what be very fundamental to this market be that and again a innovation that we have design for we exchange be that the exchange will operate warehouse around the country in which grade certification and warehouse receipting will be do and in turn we will operate a in house clearing system to assure that payment be do appropriately in the right amount and at the right time so that basically we create trust and integrity in the system obviously we work with exchange actor and as we be develop the exchange market itself we be also develop the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework the overarching legal framework for make this market work so in fact we proclamation be go to parliament next month what be really important be that the ECX will operate a market information system to disseminate price in real time to farmer around the country use vsat technology to bring a electronic price dissemination directly to farmer what this do be transform fundamentally the farmer relationship to the market whereas before the farmer use to think local meaning that he or she would go to the near local market eight to 10 kilometer away on average and sell whatever they happen to have without any idea of what the price premium or anything else be now farmer come with knowledge of what price be at the national market and they start to think national and even global they start to make not only commercial marketing decision but also plant decision on the basis of information come from the future price market and they come to the market know what grade they product will achieve in term of a price premium so all of this will transform farmer it will also transform the way trader do business it will stop they from do simple back to back limited arbitrage to really think strategically about how to move grain across long distance from surplus region to deficit area can Ethiopia do this it seem very ambitious but it will create new opportunity we believe that this initiative require great political will and we will have to align the financial sector as well as the ict sector and really even the underlying legal framework we believe that the wind of change be here and that we can do it ECX be the market for Ethiopia new millennium which start in about eight month the last parliament of we century open with we president announce to the country that this be the most important economic initiative for the country today we believe that the stake be high but that the return will be even great ECX moreover can become a trading platform for a pan African market in agricultural commodity Ethiopia domestic market be about one billion dollar of value and we feel that over the next five year if Ethiopia can capture even 40 percent just 40 percent of the domestic market and add just 25 percent value to that market the value of the market double Ethiopia agricultural market be 30 percent high than South Africa grain production and in fact Ethiopia be the second large maize producer in Africa so the potential be there the will be there the commitment be there so we feel that we have a win value proposition to transform farmer choice to grow we agriculture and to change Africa so we be in the business of find we happiness thank you very much applause
