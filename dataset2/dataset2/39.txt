well as Alexander Graham Bell famously say on he first successful telephone call hello be that Domino pizza laughter I just really want to thank you very much as another famous man Jerry Garcia say what a strange long trip and he should have say what a strange long trip it be about to become at this very moment you be view my upper half my low half be appear at a different conference laughter in a different country you can it turn out be in two place at once but still I be sorry I can not be with you in person I will explain at another time and though I be a rock star I just want to assure you that none of my wish will include a hot tub but what really turn I on about technology be not just the ability to get more song on mp3 player the revolution this revolution be much big than that I hope I believe what turn I on about the digital age what excite I personally be that you have close the gap between dream and do you see it use to be that if you want to make a record of a song you need a studio and a producer now you need a laptop if you want to make a film you need a mass of equipment and a Hollywood budget now you need a camera that fit in you palm and a couple of buck for a blank dvd imagination have be decouple from the old constraint and that really really excite I I be excited when i glimpse that kind of think writ large what I would like to see be idealism decouple from all constraint political economic psychological whatever the geopolitical world have get a lot to learn from the digital world from the ease with which you sweep away obstacle that no one know could even be budge and that be actually what I would like to talk about today first though I should probably explain why and how I get to this place it be a journey that start 20 year ago you may remember that song we be the World or do they know it be Christmas Band Aid Live Aid another very tall grizzle rock star my friend Sir Bob Geldof issue a challenge to feed the world it be a great moment and it utterly change my life that summer my wife Ali and myself go to Ethiopia we go on the quiet to see for ourselves what be go on we live in Ethiopia for a month work at a orphanage the child have a name for I they call I the girl with the beard laughter do not ask anyway we find Africa to be a magical place big sky big heart big shine continent beautiful royal person anybody who ever give anything to Africa get a lot more back Ethiopia do not just blow my mind it open my mind anyway on we last day at this orphanage a man hand I he baby and say would you take my son with you he know in Ireland that he son would live and that in Ethiopia he son would die it be the middle of that awful famine well I turn he down and it be a funny kind of sick feeling but I turn he down and it be a feeling I can not ever quite forget and in that moment I start this journey in that moment I become the bad thing of all I become a rock star with a cause laughter except this be not the cause be it six and a half thousand African die every single day from AIDS a preventable treatable disease for lack of drug we can get in any pharmacy that be not a cause that be a emergency 11 million AIDS orphan in Africa 20 million by the end of the decade that be not a cause that be a emergency today every day 9 000 more African will catch HIV because of stigmatization and lack of education that be not a cause that be a emergency so what we be talk about here be human right the right to live like a human The right to live period and what we be face in Africa be a unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality the next thing I would like to be clear about be what this problem be and what this problem be not because this be not all about charity this be about justice really this be not about charity this be about justice that be right and that be too bad because we be very good at charity American like Irish person be good at it even the poor neighborhood give more than they can afford we like to give and we give a lot look at the response to the tsunami it be inspire but justice be a tough standard than charity you see Africa make a fool of we idea of justice it make a farce of we idea of equality it mock we piety it doubt we concern it question we commitment because there be no way we can look at what be happen in Africa and if we be honest conclude that it would ever be allow to happen anywhere else as you hear in the film anywhere else not here not here not in America not in Europe in fact a head of state that you be all familiar with admit this to I and it be really true there be no chance this kind of hemorrhaging of human life would be accept anywhere else other than Africa Africa be a continent in flame and deep down if we really accept that African be equal to we we would all do more to put the fire out we be stand around with water can when what we really need be the fire brigade you see it be not as dramatic as the tsunami it be crazy really when you think about it do stuff have to look like a action movie this day to exist in the front of we brain the slow extinguishing of countless life be just not dramatic enough it would appear catastrophe that we can avert be not as interesting as one we could avert funny that anyway I believe that that kind of think offend the intellectual rigor in this room six and a half thousand person die a day in Africa may be Africa crisis but the fact that it be not on the nightly news that we in Europe or you in America be not treat it like a emergency I want to argue with you tonight that that be we crisis I want to argue that though Africa be not the front line in the war against terror it could be soon every week religious extremist take another African village they be attempt to bring order to chaos well why be not we poverty breed despair we know this despair breed violence we know this in turbulent time be not it cheap and smart to make friend out of potential enemy than to defend yourself against they later the war against terror be bind up in the war against poverty and I do not say that Colin Powell say that now when the military be tell we that this be a war that can not be win by military might alone maybe we should listen there be a opportunity here and it be real it be not spin it be not wishful think the problem face the develop world afford we in the developed world a chance to be describe ourselves to the world we will not only transform other person life but we will also transform the way that other life see we and that might be smart in this nervous dangerous time do not you think that on a purely commercial level that anti retroviral drug be great advertisement for western ingenuity and technology do not compassion look well on we and let cut the crap for a second in certain quarter of the world brand EU brand USA be not at its shiny the neon sign be fizz and crack someone put a brick through the window the regional branch manager be get nervous never before have we in the west be so scrutinize we value do we have any we credibility this thing be under attack around the world brand USA could use some Polish and I say that as a fan you know as a person who buy the product but think about it more anti retroviral make sense but that be just the easy part or ought to be but equality for Africa that be a big expensive idea you see the scale of the suffering numb we into a kind of indifference what on earth can we all do about this well much more than we think we can not fix every problem but the one we can I want to argue we must and because we can we must this be the straight truth the righteous truth it be not a theory the fact be that ours be the first generation that can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye look across the ocean to Africa and say this and mean it we do not have to stand for this a whole continent write off we do not have to stand for this applause and let I say this without a trace of irony before I back it up to a bunch of ex hippie forget the 60 we can change the world I can not you can not as individual but we can change the world I really believe that the person in this room look at the Gates Foundation they have do incredible stuff unbelievable stuff but work together we can actually change the world we can turn the inevitable outcome and transform the quality of life for million of life who look and feel rather like we when you be up close I be sorry to laugh here but you do look so different than you do in Haight Ashbury in the 60 laughter but I want to argue that this be the moment that you be design for it be the flowering of the seed you plant in early heady day idea that you gestate in you youth this be what excite I this room be bear for this moment be really what I want to say to you tonight most of you start out want to change the world do not you most of you do the digital world well now actually because of you it be possible to change the physical world it be a fact economist confirm it and they know much more than I do so why then be we not pump we fist into the air probably because when we admit we can do something about it we have get to do something about it it be a pain in the arse this equality business be actually a pain in the arse but for the first time in history we have the technology we have the know how we have the cash we have the life save drug do we have the will I hope this be obvious but I be not a hippie and I be not really one for the warm fuzzy feeling I do not have flower in my hair actually I come from punk rock the clash wear big army boot not sandal but I know toughness when I see it and for all the talk of peace and love on the West Coast there be muscle to the movement that start out here you see idealism detach from action be just a dream but idealism ally with pragmatism with roll up you sleeve and make the world bend a bit be very exciting it be very real it be very strong and it be very present in a crowd like you last year at DATA this organization I help set up we launch a campaign to summon this spirit in the fight against AIDS and extreme poverty we be call it the one campaign it be base on we belief that the action of one person can change a lot but the action of many come together as one can change the world well we feel that now be the time to prove we be right there be moment in history when civilization redefine itself we believe this be one we believe that this could be the time when the world finally decide that the wanton loss of life in Africa be just no long acceptable this could be the time that we finally get serious about change the future for most person who live on planet Earth Momentum have be build lurch a little but it be build this year be a test for we all especially the leader of the g8 nation who really be on the line here with all the world in history watch I have be of late disappointed with the Bush Administration they start out with such promise on Africa they make some really great promise and actually have fulfil a lot of they but some of they they have not they do not feel the push from the ground be the truth but my disappointment have much more perspective when I talk to American person and I hear they worry about the deficit and the fiscal well be of they country I understand that but there be much more push from the ground than you would think if we get organize what I try to communicate and you can help I if you agree be that aid for Africa be just great value for money at a time when America really need it put it in the crass possible term the investment reap huge return not only in life save but in goodwill stability and security that we will gain so this be what I hope that you will do if I could be so bold and not have it deduct from my number of wish laughter what I hope be that beyond individual merciful act that you will tell the politician to do right by Africa by America and by the world give they permission if you like to spend they political capital and you financial capital you national purse on save the life of million of person that be really what I would like you to do because we also need you intellectual capital you idea you skill you ingenuity and you at this conference be in a unique position some of the technology we have be talk about you invent they or at least revolutionize the way that they be use together you have change the zeitgeist from analog to digital and push the boundary and we would like you to give we that energy give we that kind of dream that kind of do as I say there be two thing on the line here there be the continent Africa but there be also we sense of ourselves People be start to figure this out movement be spring up Artists politician pop star priest ceo NGOs mother union student union a lot of person be get together and work under this umbrella I tell you about early the one campaign I think they just have one idea in they mind which be where you live in the world should not determine whether you live in the world applause history like God be watch what we do when the history book get write I think we age will be remember for three thing really it be just three thing this whole age will be remember for the digital revolution yes the war against terror yes and what we do or do not do to put out the fire in Africa some say we can not afford to I say we can not afford not to thank you thank you very much applause okay my three wish the one that TED have offer to grant you see if this be true and I believe it be that the digital world you all create have uncoupled the creative imagination from the physical constraint of matter this should be a piece of piss laughter I should add that this start out as a much long list of wish most of they impossible some of they impractical and one or two of they certainly immoral laughter this business it get to be addictive you know what I mean when somebody else be pick up the tab anyway here be number one I wish for you to help build a social movement of more than one million American activist for Africa that be my first wish I believe it be possible a few minute ago I talk about all the citizen campaign that be spring up you know there be lot out there and with this one campaign as we umbrella my organization DATA and other group have be tap into the energy and the enthusiasm that be out there from Hollywood into the heartland of America we know there be more than enough energy to power this movement we just need you help in make it happen we want all of you here church America corporate America Microsoft America Apple America Coke America Pepsi America nerd America noisy America we can not afford to be cool and sit this one out I do believe if we build a movement that be one million American strong we be not go to be deny we will have the ear of Congress we will be the first page in Condi Rice briefing book and right into the Oval Office if there be one million American and I really know this who be ready to make phone call who be ready to be on email I be absolutely sure that we can actually change the course of history literally for the continent of Africa anyway so I would like you help in get that sign up I know John Gage and Sun Microsystems be already on board for this but there be lot of you we would like to talk to right my second wish number two I would like one media hit for every person on the planet who be live on less than one dollar a day that be one billion media hit could be on Google could be on AOL Steve Case Larry Sergey they have do a lot already it could be NBC it could be ABC actually we be talk to ABC today about the Oscars we have a film produce by Jon Kamen at Radical Media but you know we want we need some airtime for we idea we need to get the math we need to get the statistics out to the American person I really believe that old Truman line that if you give the American person the fact they will do the right thing and the other thing that be important be that this be not Sally Struthers this have to be describe as a adventure not a burden video one by one they step forward a nurse a teacher a homemaker and life be save the problem be enormous every three second one person die another three second one more the situation be so desperate in part of Africa Asia even America that aid group just as they do for the tsunami be unite as one act as one we can beat extreme poverty starvation aid but we need you help one more person letter voice will mean the difference between life and death for million of person please join we by work together American have a unprecedented opportunity we can make history we can start to make poverty history one by one by one please visit one at this address we be not ask for you money we be ask for you voice Bono All right I wish for TED to truly show the power of information its power to rewrite the rule and transform life by connect every hospital health clinic and school in one African country and I would like it to be Ethiopia I believe we can connect every school in Ethiopia every health clinic every hospital we can connect to the internet that be my wish my third wish I think it be possible I think we have the money and brain in the room to do that and that would be a mind blow wish to come true I have be to Ethiopia as I say early it be actually where it all start for I the idea that the internet which change all of we life can transform a country and a continent that have hardly make it to analog let alone digital blow my mind but it do not start out that way the first long distance line from Boston to New York be use in 1885 on the phone it be just nine year late that Addis Ababa be connect by phone to Harare which be 500 kilometer away since then not that much have change the average waiting time to get a landline in Ethiopia be actually about seven or eight year but wireless technology be not dream up then anyway I be Irish and as you can see I know how important talking be communication be very important for Ethiopia will transform the country nurse get good training pharmacist be able to order supply doctor share they expertise in all aspect of medicine it be a very very good idea to get they wire and that be my third and final wish for you at the TED conference thank you very much once again applause
