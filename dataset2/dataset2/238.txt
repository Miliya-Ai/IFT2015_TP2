welcome if I could have the first slide please contrary to calculation make by some engineer bee can fly dolphin can swim and gecko can even climb up the smooth surface now what I want to do in the short time I have be to try to allow each of you to experience the thrill of reveal nature design I get to do this all the time and it be just incredible I want to try to share just a little bit of that with you in this presentation the challenge of look at nature design and I will tell you the way that we perceive it and the way we have use it the challenge of course be to answer this question what permit this extraordinary performance of animal that allow they basically to go anywhere and if we could figure that out how can we implement that design well many biologist will tell engineer and other organism have million of year to get it right they be spectacular they can do everything wonderfully well so the answer be bio mimicry just copy nature directly we know from work on animal that the truth be that be exactly what you do not want to do because evolution work on the just good enough principle not on a perfect principle and the constraint in build any organism when you look at it be really severe natural technology have incredible constraint think about it if you be a engineer and I tell you that you have to build a automobile but it have to start off to be this big then it have to grow to be full size and have to work every step along the way or think about the fact that if you build a automobile I will tell you that you also inside it have to put a factory that allow you to make another automobile laughter and you can absolutely never absolutely never because of history and the inherit plan start with a clean slate so organism have this important history really evolution work more like a tinkerer than a engineer and this be really important when you begin to look at animal instead we believe you need to be inspire by biology you need to discover the general principle of nature and then use this analogy when they be advantageous this be a real challenge to do this because animal when you start to really look inside they how they work appear hopelessly complex there be no detailed history of the design plan you can not go look it up anywhere they have way too many motion for they joint too many muscle even the simple animal we think of something like a insect and they have more neuron and connection than you can imagine how can you make sense of this well we believe and we hypothesize that one way animal could work simply be if the control of they movement tend to be build into they body themselves what we discover be that two four six and eight legged animal all produce the same force on the ground when they move they all work like this kangaroo they bounce and they can be model by a spring mass system that we call the spring mass system because we be biomechanist it be actually a pogo stick they all produce the pattern of a pogo stick how be that true well a human one of you leg work like two leg of a trot dog or work like three leg together as one of a trot insect or four leg as one of a trot crab and then they alternate in they propulsion but the pattern be all the same almost every organism we have look at this way you will see next week I will give you a hint there will be a article come out that say that really big thing like t rex probably could not do this but you will see that next week now what be interesting be the animal then we say bounce along the vertical plane this way and in we collaboration with Pixar in a bug life we discuss the bipedal nature of the character of the ant and we tell they of course they move in another plane as well and they ask we this question they say why model just in the sagittal plane or the vertical plane when you be tell we this animal be move in the horizontal plane this be a good question nobody in biology ever model it this way we take they advice and we model the animal move in the horizontal plane as well we take they three leg we collapse they down as one we get some of the good mathematician in the world from Princeton to work on this problem and we be able to create a model where animal be not only bounce up and down but they be also bounce side to side at the same time and many organism fit this kind of pattern now why be this important to have this model because it be very interesting when you take this model and you perturb it you give it a push as it bump into something it self stabilize with no brain or no reflex just by the structure alone it be a beautiful model let look at the mathematics laughter that be enough laughter the animal when you look at they run appear to be self stabilize like this use basically springy leg that be the leg can do computation on they own the control algorithm in a sense be embed in the form of the animal itself why have not we be more inspire by nature and this kind of discovery well I would argue that human technology be really different from natural technology at least they have be so far think about the typical kind of robot that you see human technology have tend to be large flat with right angle stiff make of metal they have roll device and axle there be very few motor very few sensor whereas nature tend to be small and curved and it bend and twist and have leg instead and appendage and have many muscle and many many sensor so it be a very different design however what be change what be really exciting and I will show you some of that next be that as human technology take on more of the characteristic of nature then nature really can become a much more useful teacher and here be one example that be really exciting this be a collaboration we have with Stanford and they develop this new technique call shape deposition Manufacturing it be a technique where they can mix material together and mold any shape that they like and put in the material property they can embed sensor and actuator right in the form itself for example here be a leg the clear part be stiff the white part be compliant and you do not need any axle there or anything it just bend by itself beautifully so you can put that property in it inspire they to show off this design by produce a little robot they name sprawl we work have also inspire another robot a biologically inspire bounce robot from the University of Michigan and McGill name RHex for robot hexapod and this one autonomous let go to the video and let I show you some of this animal move and then some of the simple robot that have be inspire by we discovery here be what some of you do this morning although you do it outside not on a treadmill here be what we do laughter this be a death head cockroach this be a American cockroach you think you do not have in you kitchen this be a eight legged scorpion six legged ant forty four legged centipede now I say all this animal be sort of work like pogo stick they be bounce along as they move and you can see that in this ghost crab from the beach of Panama and North Carolina it go up to four meter per second when it run it actually leap into the air and have aerial phase when it do it like a horse and you will see it be bounce here what we discover be whether you look at the leg of a human like Richard or a cockroach or a crab or a kangaroo the relative leg stiffness of that spring be the same for everything we have see so far now what good be springy leg then what can they do well we want to see if they allow the animal to have great stability and maneuverability so we build a terrain that have obstacle three time the hip height of the animal that we be look at and we be certain they could not do this and here be what they do the animal run over it and it do not even slow down it do not decrease its preferred speed at all we could not believe that it could do this it say to we that if you could build a robot with very simple springy leg you could make it as maneuverable as any that be ever be build here be the first example of that this be the Stanford shape deposition manufacture robot name sprawl it have six leg there be the tune springy leg it move in a gait that a insect use and here it be go on the treadmill now what be important about this robot compare to other robot be that it can not see anything it can not feel anything it do not have a brain yet it can maneuver over this obstacle without any difficulty whatsoever it be this technique of build the property into the form this be a graduate student this be what he be do to he thesis project very robust if a graduate student do that to he thesis project laughter this be from McGill and University of Michigan this be the rhex make its first outing in a demo laughter same principle it only have six move part six motor but it have springy tune leg it move in the gait of the insect it have the middle leg move in synchrony with the front and the hind leg on the other side sort of a alternate tripod and they can negotiate obstacle just like the animal laughter Voice oh my God applause Robert full it will go on different surface here be sand although we have not perfect the foot yet but I will talk about that later here be RHex enter the wood laughter again this robot can not see anything it can not feel anything it have no brain it be just work with a tune mechanical system with very simple part but inspire from the fundamental dynamics of the animal Voice Ah I love he Bob RF here be it go down a pathway I present this to the jet propulsion lab at NASA and they say that they have no ability to go down crater to look for ice and life ultimately on Mars and he say especially with legged robot because they be way too complicated nothing can do that and I talk next I show they this video with the simple design of rhex here and just to convince they we should go to Mars in 2011 I tint the video orange just to give they the sense of be on Mars laughter applause another reason why animal have extraordinary performance and can go anywhere be because they have a effective interaction with the environment the animal I be go to show you that we study to look at this be the gecko we have one here and notice its position it be hold on now I be go to challenge you I be go show you a video one of the animal be go to be run on the level and the other one be go to be run up a wall which one which they be go at a meter a second how many think the one on the left be run up the wall applause okay the point be it be really hard to tell be not it it be incredible we look at student do this and they could not tell they can run up a wall at a meter a second 15 step per second and they look like they be run on the level how do they do this it be just phenomenal the one on the right be go up the hill how do they do this they have bizarre toe they have toe that uncurl like party favor when you blow they out and then peel off the surface like tape like if we have a piece of tape now we have peel it this way they do this with they toe it be bizarre this peel inspire iRobot that we work with to build Mecho Geckos here be a legged version and a tractor version or a bulldozer version let see some of the gecko move with some video and then I will show you a little bit of a clip of the robot here be the gecko run up a vertical surface there it go in real time there it go again obviously we have to slow this down a little bit you can not use regular camera you have to take 1 000 picture per second to see this and here be some video at 1 000 frame per second now I want you to look at the animal back do you see how much it be bend like that we can not figure that out that be a unsolved mystery we do not know how it work if you have a son or a daughter that want to come to Berkeley come to my lab and we will figure this out okay send they to Berkeley because that be the next thing I want to do here be the gecko mill laughter it be a see through treadmill with a see through treadmill belt so we can watch the animal foot and videotape they through the treadmill belt to see how they move here be the animal that we have here run on a vertical surface pick a foot and try to watch a toe and see if you can see what the animal do see it uncurl and then peel this toe it can do this in 14 millisecond it be unbelievable here be the robot that they inspire the Mecho Geckos from iRobot First we will see the animal toe peel look at that and here be the peel action of the Mecho Gecko it use a pressure sensitive adhesive to do it peel in the animal peel in the Mecho Gecko that allow they climb autonomously can go on the flat surface transition to a wall and then go onto a ceiling there be the bulldozer version now it do not use pressure sensitive glue the animal do not use that but that be what we be limit to at the moment what do the animal do the animal have weird toe and if you look at the toe they have this little leaf there and if you blow they up and zoom in you will see that be there be little striation in this leaf and if you zoom in 270 time you will see it look like a rug and if you blow that up and zoom in 900 time you see there be hair there tiny hair and if you look carefully that tiny hair have striation and if you zoom in on that 30 000 time you will see each hair have split end and if you blow that up they have this little structure on the end the small branch of the hair look like spatula and a animal like that have one billion of this nano size split end to get very close to the surface in fact there be the diameter of you hair a gecko have two million of this and each hair have 100 to 1 000 split end think of the contact of that that be possible we be fortunate to work with another group at Stanford that build we a special manned sensor that we be able to measure the force of a individual hair here be a individual hair with a little split end there when we measure the force they be enormous they be so large that a patch of hair about this size the gecko foot could support the weight of a small child about 40 pound easily now how do they do it we have recently discover this do they do it by friction no force be too low do they do it by electrostatic no you can change the charge they still hold on do they do it by interlock that be kind of a like a velcro like thing no you can put they on molecular smooth surface they do not do it how about suction they stick on in a vacuum how about wet adhesion or capillary adhesion they do not have any glue and they even stick under water just fine if you put they foot under water they grab on how do they do it then believe it or not they grab on by intermolecular force by Van der Waals force you know you probably have this a long time ago in chemistry where you have this two atom they be close together and the electron be move around that tiny force be sufficient to allow they to do that because it be add up so many time with this small structure what we be do be we be take that inspiration of the hair and with another colleague at Berkeley we be manufacture they and just recently we have make a breakthrough where we now believe we be go to be able to create the first synthetic self clean dry adhesive many company be interested in this laughter we also present to Nike even laughter applause we will see where this go we be so excited about this that we realize that that small size scale and where everything get sticky and gravity do not matter anymore we need to look at ant and they foot because one of my other colleague at Berkeley have build a six millimeter silicone robot with leg but it get stuck it do not move very well but the ant do and we will figure out why so that ultimately we will make this move and imagine you be go to be able to have swarm of this six millimeter robot available to run around where be this go I think you can see it already clearly the internet be already have eye and ear you have web cam and so forth but it be go to also have leg and hand you be go to be able to do programmable work through this kind of robot so that you can run fly and swim anywhere we see David Kelly be at the beginning of that with he fish so in conclusion I think the message be clear if you need a message if nature be not enough if you care about search and rescue or mine clearance or medicine or the various thing we be work on we must preserve nature design otherwise this secret will be lose forever thank you applause
