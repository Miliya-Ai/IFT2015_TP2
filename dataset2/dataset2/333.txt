I have like a thing about sleep I do not sleep that much and I have come to this thing about like not sleep much as be a great virtue after year of kind of battle it as be a terrible detriment or something and now I really like sort of sit up you know but for year I have be sit up and I think that like my creativity be greatly motivate by this kind of insomnia I lie awake I think thought I walk aimlessly sometimes I use to walk more at night I walk during the day and I follow person who I think look interesting laughter and sometimes actually once it be on Page Six in the Post that I be cruise this guy like sort of whatever but I be actually just follow because he have this really great shoe on and so I be follow this guy and I take a picture of he shoe and we thank each other and just go on we way but I do that all the time as a matter of fact I think a lot of my design idea come from mistake and trick of the eye because I feel like you know there be so many image out there so many clothes out there and the only one that look interesting to I be the one that look slightly mistaken of course or very very surprising and often I be drive in a taxi and I see a hole in a shirt or something that look very interesting or pretty or functional in some way that I have never see happen before and so I would make the car stop and I would get out of the car and walk and see that in fact there be not a hole but it be a trick of my eye it be a shadow you know or if there be a hole I have think like oh damn there be actually someone thought of that thought already someone make that mistake already so I can not do it anymore I do not know where inspiration come from it do not come for I from research I do not get necessarily inspire by research as a matter of fact one of the most fun thing I have ever ever do in my whole life be this Christmas season at the Guggenheim in New York I read Peter and the Wolf with this beautiful band from Juilliard and I do like you know the narrator and I read it and I see this really smart critic who I love this woman Joan Acocella who be a friend of mine and she come backstage and she say oh you know Isaac do you know that talk about Stalinism and talk about you know like the 30 in Russia and I say how do I know about Stalinism I know about a wolf and a bird and you know he eat the bird and then in the end you hear you know you hear the bird squeak or something you know so I do not really know that I do not really actually I do my own kind of research you know if I be commission to do the costume for a 18th century opera or something like that I will do a lot of research because it be interesting not because it be what I be suppose to do I be very very very inspire by movie the color of movie and the way light make the color light from behind the projection or light from the projection make the color look so impossible and anyway roll this little clip I will just show you I sit up at night and I watch movie and I watch woman in movie a lot and I think about you know they role and about how you have to like watch what you daughter look at because I look at the way woman be portray all the time whether they be kind of glorify in this way or whether they be kind of you know ironically glorify or whether they be you know sort of denigrate or ironically denigrate I go back to color all the time Color be something that motivate I a lot it be rarely color that I find in nature although you know juxtapose next to artificial color natural color be so beautiful so that be what I do I study color a lot but for the most part I think like how can I ever make anything that be as beautiful as that image of Natalie Wood how can I ever make anything as beautiful as Greta Garbo I mean that be just not possible you know and so that be what make I lie awake at night I guess you know I want to show you I be also like a big I go to astrologer and tarot card reader often and that be another thing that motivate I a lot person say oh do that a astrologer tell I to do something so I do it laughter when I be about 21 a astrologer tell I that I be go to meet the man of my dream and that he name be go to be Eric right so you know for year I would go to bar and sort of anyone I meet whose name be Eric I be hump immediately or something laughter and there be time when I be actually so desperate I would just you know walk into a room and just go like Eric and anybody who would turn around I would sort of make a beeline for laughter and I have this really interesting tarot read a long time ago the last card he pull which be represent my destiny be this guy on like a straw boater with a cane and you know sort of spat and this you know a minstrel singer right I want to show you this clip because I do this kind of crazy thing where I do a cabaret act so actually check this out very embarrassing video thank you we can do anything you ask the name of the show be base on this story that I have to tell you about my mother it be sort of a excerpt from a quote of hers I be date this guy right and this have to do with be happy I swear I be date this guy and it be go on for about a year right and we be get serious so we decide to invite they all to dinner we parent and we you know sort of introduce they to each other my mother be sort of very sensitive to he mother who it seem be a little bit skeptical about the whole alternative lifestyle thing you know homosexuality right so my mother be a little offended she turn to she and she say be you kid they have the great life together they eat out they see show they eat out they see show laughter that be the name of the show they eat out they that be on my tombstone when I die he eat out he see show right so in edit this clip I do not have the audacity to edit a clip of I sing at Joe pub so you will have to like go check it out and come see I or something because it be mortifying and yet it feel I do not know how to put this I feel as little comfort as possible be a good thing you know and at least you know in my case because if I just do one thing all the time I do not know I get very very bored I bear very easily and you know I do not say that I do everything well I just say that I do a lot of thing that be all and I kind of try not to look back you know except I guess that be what stay up every night be about like look back and think what a fool you make of yourself you know but I guess that be okay right because if you do many thing you get to feel lousy about everything and not just one you know you do not master feel lousy about one thing yeah exactly I will show you this next thing speak of costume for opera I do work with different choreographer I work with Twyla Tharp a lot and I work with Mark Morris a lot who be one of my good friend and I design three opera with he and the most recent one King Arthur I have be very ingrained in the dance world since I be a teenager I go to perform art high school where I be a actor and many of my friend be ballet dancer again I do not know where inspiration come from I do not know where it come from I start make puppet when I be a kid maybe that be where the whole inspiration thing start from puppet right and then perform art high school there I be in high school meeting dancer and act and somehow from there I get interested in design I go to Parsons School of Design and then I begin my career as a designer I do not really think of myself as a designer I do not really think of myself necessarily as a fashion designer and frankly I do not really know what to call myself I think of myself as a I do not know what I think of myself as it be just that laughter but I must say this whole thing about be slightly bored all the time that be what I think that be a very important thing for a fashion designer you always have to be slightly bored with everything and if you be not you have to pretend to be slightly bored with everything laughter but I be really a little bored with everything I always say to my partner Marisa Gardini who book everything she book everything and she make everything happen and she make all the deal and I always tell she that I find myself with a lot of time on the computer bridge program too much time on computer bridge which be you know like that be so somehow like about ten year ago I think that the most unboring place in the world would be like a t v studio like for a day show some kind of day talk show because it be all of this thing that I love all kind of in one place and if you ever get bored you can look at another thing and do another thing and talk about it right and so I have this t v show and that be a very very very big part of my process actually could you roll the clip please this be one of my favorite clip of Rosie Video Isaac Mizrahi we be back on the set hi there Rosie O Donnell Hello Ben IM look how cute she look with this just a slick back Man she grandmother say Delish IM Ah wow
