thank you for put up this picture of my colleague over here laughter we will be talk about they now I be go try a experiment I do not do experiment normally I be a theorist but I be go see what happen if I press this button sure enough ok I use to work in this field of elementary particle what happen to matter if you chop it up very fine what be it make of and the law of this particle be valid throughout the universe and they be very much connect with the history of the universe we know a lot about four force there must be a lot more but that be at very very small distance and we have not really interact with they very much yet the main thing I want to talk about be this that we have this remarkable experience in this field of fundamental physics that beauty be a very successful criterion for choose the right theory and why on earth could that be so well here be a example from my own experience it be fairly dramatic actually to have this happen three or four of we in 1957 put forward a partially complete theory of one of this force this weak force and it be in disagreement with seven seven count they seven experiment experiment be all wrong and we publish before know that because we figure it be so beautiful it be get ta be right the experiment have to be wrong and they be now we friend over there Albert Einstein use to pay very little attention when person say you know there be a man with a experiment that seem to disagree with special relativity DC Miller what about that and he would say aw that will go away laughter now why do stuff like that work that be the question now yeah what do we mean by beautiful that be one thing I will try to make that clear partially clear why should it work and be this something to do with human being I will let you in on the answer to the last one that I offer and that be it have nothing to do with human being somewhere in some other planet orbit some very distant star maybe in a another galaxy there could well be entity that be at least as intelligent as we be and be interested in science it be not impossible I think there probably be lot very likely none be close enough to interact with we but they could be out there very easily and suppose they have you know very different sensory apparatus and so on they have seven tentacle and they have 14 little funny looking compound eye and a brain shape like a pretzel would they really have different law there be lot of person who believe that and I think it be utter baloney I think there be law out there and we of course do not understand they at any give time very well but we try and we try to get close and close and someday we may actually figure out the fundamental unified theory of the particle and force what I call the fundamental law we may not even be terribly far from it but even if we do not run across it in we lifetime we can still think there be one out there and we be just try to get close and close to it I think that be the main point to be make we express this thing mathematically and when the mathematics be very simple when in term of some mathematical notation you can write the theory in a very brief space without a lot of complication that be essentially what we mean by beauty or elegance here be what I be say about the law they be really there Newton certainly believe that and he say here it be the business of natural philosophy to find out that law the basic law let say here be a assumption the assumption be that the basic law really take the form of a unified theory of all the particle now some person call that a theory of everything that be wrong because the theory be quantum mechanical and I will not go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanic and what it be like and so on you have hear a lot of wrong thing about it anyway laughter there be even movie about it with a lot of wrong stuff but the main thing here be that it predict probability now sometimes that probability be near certainty and in a lot of familiar case they of course be but other time they be not and you have only probability for different outcome so what that mean be that the history of the universe be not determine just by the fundamental law it be the fundamental law and this incredibly long series of accident or chance outcome that be there in addition and the fundamental theory do not include that chance outcome they be in addition so it be not a theory of everything and in fact a huge amount of the information in the universe around we come from that accident and not just from the fundamental law now it be often say that get close and close to the fundamental law by examine phenomenon at low energy and then high energy and then high energy or short distance and then short distance and then still short distance and so on be like peel the skin of a onion and we keep do that and build more powerful machine accelerator for particle we look deep and deep into the structure of particle and in that way we get probably close and close to this fundamental law now what happen be that as we do that as we peel this skin of the onion and we get close and close to the underlying law we see that each skin have something in common with the previous one and with the next one we write they out mathematically and we see they use very similar mathematics they require very similar mathematics that be absolutely remarkable and that be a central feature of what I be try to say today Newton call it that be Newton by the way that one this one be Albert Einstein Hi Al and anyway he say nature conformable to herself personify nature as a female and so what happen be that the new phenomena the new skin the inner skin of the slightly small skin of the onion that we get to resemble the slightly large one and the kind of mathematics that we have for the previous skin be almost the same as what we need for the next skin and that be why the equation look so simple because they use mathematics we already have a trivial example be this Newton find the law of gravity which go like one over the square of the distance between the thing gravitate Coulomb in France find the same law for electric charge here be a example of this similarity you look at gravity you see a certain law then you look at electricity sure enough the same rule it be a very simple example there be lot of more sophisticated example Symmetry be very important in this discussion you know what it mean a circle for example be symmetric under rotation about the center of the circle you rotate around the center of the circle the circle remain unchanged you take a sphere in three dimension you rotate around the center of the sphere and all that rotation leave the sphere alone they be symmetry of the sphere so we say in general that there be a symmetry under certain operation if that operation leave the phenomenon or its description unchanged Maxwell equation be of course symmetrical under rotation of all of space do not matter if we turn the whole of space around by some angle it do not leave the do not change the phenomenon of electricity or magnetism there be a new notation in the 19th century that express this and if you use that notation the equation get a lot simple then Einstein with he special theory of relativity look at a whole set of symmetry of Maxwell equation which be call special relativity and that symmetry then make the equation even short and even pretty therefore let look you do not have to know what this thing mean do not make any difference but you can just look at the form laughter you can look at the form you see above at the top a long list of equation with three component for the three direction of space x y and z then use vector analysis you use rotational symmetry and you get this next set then you use the symmetry of special relativity and you get a even simple set down here show that symmetry exhibit good and good the more and more symmetry you have the good you exhibit the simplicity and elegance of the theory the last two the first equation say that electric charge and current give rise to all the electric and magnetic field the next second equation say that there be no magnetism other than that the only magnetism come from electric charge and current someday we may find some slight hole in that argument but for the moment that be the case now here be a very exciting development that many person have not hear of they should have hear of it but it be a little tricky to explain in technical detail so I will not do it I will just mention it laughter but Chen Ning Yang call by we Frank Yang laughter and Bob Mills put forward 50 year ago this generalization of Maxwell equation with a new symmetry a whole new symmetry Mathematics very similar but there be a whole new symmetry they hope that this would contribute somehow to particle physics do not it do not by itself contribute to particle physics but then some of we generalize it further and then it do and it give a very beautiful description of the strong force and of the weak force so here we say again what we say before that each skin of the onion show a similarity to the adjoining skin so the mathematics for the adjoining skin be very similar to what we need for the new one and therefore it look beautiful because we already know how to write it in a lovely concise way so here be the theme we believe there be a unified theory underlie all the regularity step toward unification exhibit the simplicity symmetry exhibit the simplicity and then there be self similarity across the scale in other word from one skin of the onion to another one Proximate self similarity and that account for this phenomenon that will account for why beauty be a successful criterion for select the right theory here be what Newton himself say Nature be very consonant and conformable to she self one thing he be think of be something that most of we take for grant today but in he day it be not take for grant there be the story which be not absolutely certain to be right but a lot of person tell it four source tell it that when they have the plague in Cambridge and he go down to he mother farm because the university be close he see a apple fall from a tree or on he head or something and he realize suddenly that the force that draw the apple down to the earth could be the same as the force regulate the motion of the planet and the moon that be a big unification for that day although today we take it for grant it be the same theory of gravity so he say that this principle of nature consonance this principle of nature be very remote from the conception of philosopher I forbear to describe it in that book lest I should be account a extravagant freak that be what we all have to watch out for laughter especially at this meeting and so prejudice my reader against all that thing which be the main design of the book now who today would claim that as a mere conceit of the human mind that the force that cause the apple to fall to the ground be the same force that cause the planet and the moon to move around and so on everybody know that it be a property of gravitation it be not something in the human mind the human mind can of course appreciate it and enjoy it use it but it be not it do not stem from the human mind it stem from the character of gravity and that be true of all the thing we be talk about they be property of the fundamental law the fundamental law be such that the different skin of the onion resemble one another and therefore the math for one skin allow you to express beautifully and simply the phenomenon of the next skin I say here that Newton do a lot of thing that year gravity the law of motion the calculus white light compose of all the color of the rainbow and he could have write quite a essay on what I do over my summer vacation laughter so we do not have to assume this principle as separate metaphysical postulate they follow from the fundamental theory they be what we call emergent property you do not need you do not need something more to get something more that be what emergence mean life can emerge from physics and chemistry plus a lot of accident the human mind can arise from neurobiology and a lot of accident the way the chemical bond arise from physics and certain accident it do not diminish the importance of this subject to know that they follow from more fundamental thing plus accident that be a general rule and it be critically important to realize that you do not need something more in order to get something more person keep ask that when they read my book the Quark and the Jaguar and they say be not there something more beyond what you have there presumably they mean something supernatural anyway there be not laughter you do not need something more to explain something more thank you very much applause
