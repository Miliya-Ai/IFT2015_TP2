some of you have hear the story before but in fact there be somebody in the audience who be never hear this story in front of a audience before so I be a little more nervous than I normally be tell this story I use to be a photographer for many year in 1978 I be work for time magazine and I be give a three day assignment to photograph amerasian child child who have be father by American gi all over Southeast Asia and then abandon 40 000 child all over Asia I have never hear the word amerasian before I spend a few day photograph child in different country and like a lot of photographer and a lot of journalist I always hope that when my picture be publish they might actually have a effect on a situation instead of just document it so I be so disturb by what I see and I be so unhappy with the article that run afterwards that I decide I would take six month off I be 28 year old I decide I would find six child in different country and actually go spend some time with the kid and try to tell they story a little bit good than I think I have do for Time magazine in the course of do the story I be look for child who have not be photograph before and the Pearl Buck Foundation tell I that they work with a lot of American who be donate money to help some of this kid and a man tell I who run the Pearl Buck Foundation in Korea that there be a young girl who be 11 year old be raise by she grandmother and the grandmother have never let any Westerner see she every time any Westerner come to the village she hide the girl of course I be immediately intrigue I see photograph of she and I think I want to go and the guy just tell I this grandmother there be no way she be ever go to let you meet this girl that be she be raise I take a translator with I and go to this village find the grandmother sit down with she and to my astonishment she agree to let I photograph she granddaughter and I be pay for this myself so I ask the translator if it would be ok if I stay for the week I have a sleeping bag the family have a small shed on the side of the house so I say could I sleep in my sleeping bag in the evening and I just tell the little girl whose name be Eun Sook Lee that if I ever do anything to embarrass she she do not speak a word of English although she look very American she could put up she hand and say stop and I would stop take picture then my translator leave I could not speak a word of Korean this be the first night I meet Eun Sook she mother be still alive she be not raise she she grandmother be raise she and what strike I immediately be how in love the two of this person be the grandmother be incredibly fond deeply in love with this little girl they sleep on the floor at night the way they heat they home in Korea be to put brick under the floor so the heat radiate from underneath the floor Eun Sook be 11 year old I have photograph as I say a lot of this kid Eun Sook be the fifth child that I find to photograph and almost universally amongst all the kid they be really psychologically damage by have be make fun of ridicule pick on and be reject and Korea be probably the place I find to be the bad for this kid and what strike I immediately in meeting Eun Sook be how confident she appear to be how happy she seem to be in she own skin and remember this picture because I be go to show you another picture later she look much like she grandmother although she look so western I decide to follow she to school this be the first morning I stay with she this be on the way to school this be the morning assembly outside she school and I notice that she be clown around when the teacher would ask question she would be the first person to raise she hand again not at all shy or withdraw or anything like the other child that I have photograph the first one to go to the blackboard to answer question get in trouble for whisper into she good friend ear and one of the other thing I say to she through the translator again this thing about say stop be to not pay attention to I so she really just completely ignore I most of the time I notice that at recess she be the girl who pick the other girl to be on she team it be very obvious from the beginning that she be a leader this be on the way home and that be North Korea up along the hill this be up along the DMZ they would actually cover the window every night so that light could not be see because the south Korean government have say for year that the North Korean may invade at any time so the close you be to North Korea the more terrifying it be very often at school I would be take picture and she would whisper into she girlfriend ear and then look at I and say stop and I would stand at attention and all the girl would crack up and it be sort of a little joke laughter the end of the week come and my translator come back because I have ask she to come back so I could formally thank the grandmother and Eun Sook and in the course of the grandmother talk to the translator the grandmother start cry and I say to my translator what be go on why be she cry and she speak to the grandmother for a moment and then she start get tear in she eye and I say what do I do why be everyone cry and the translator say the grandmother say that she think she be die and she want to know if you would take Eun Sook to America with you and I say I be 28 year old and I live in hotel and I be not marry I mean I have fall in love with this girl but you know emotionally I be about 12 year old if you know of photographer the joke be it be the fine form of delay adolescence ever invent sorry I have to go on a assignment I will be back and then you never come back so I ask the translator why she think she be die can I get she to a hospital could I pay to get she a doctor and she refuse any help at all so when I get outside I give the translator some money and say go back and see if you can do something and I give the grandmother my business card and I say if you be serious I will try to find a family for she and I immediately write a letter to my good friend in Atlanta Georgia who have a 11 year old son and my good friend have mistakenly one day say something about wish he have another child so my friend gene and Gayle have not hear from I in about a year and suddenly I be call say I be in Korea and I have meet this extraordinary girl and I say the grandmother think she be sick but I think maybe we would have to bring the grandmother over also and I say I will pay for the I mean I have this whole sort of picture so anyway I leave and my friend actually say they be very interested in adopt she and I say look I think I will scare the grandmother to death if I tell she that you be willing to adopt she I want to go back and talk to she but I be off on assignment I figure I would come back in a couple of week and talk to the grandmother and on Christmas Day I be in Bangkok with a group of photographer and get a telegram back in that day you get telegram from Time magazine say someone in Korea have die and leave they child in a will to I do I know anything about this because I have not tell they what I be do because I be so upset with the story they would run so I go back to Korea and I go back to Eun Sook village and she be go and the house that I have spend time in be empty it be incredibly cold no one in the village would tell I where Eun Sook be because the grandmother have always hide she from Westerner and they have no idea about this request that she have make of I so I finally find Myung Sung she good friend that she use to play with after school every day and Myung Sung under some pressure from I and the translator give we a address on the outside of Seoul and I go to that address and knock on the door and a man answer the door it be not a very nice area of Seoul there be mud street outside of it and I knock on the door and Eun Sook answer the door and she eye be bloodshot and she seem to be in shock she do not recognize I there be no recognition whatsoever and this man come to the door and kind of bark something in Korean and I say to the translator what do he say and she say he want to know who you be and I say tell he that I be a photographer I start explain who I be and he interrupt and she say he say he know who you be what do you want I say well tell he that I be ask by this little girl grandmother to find a family for she and he say I be she uncle she be fine you can leave now so I be the door be be slam in my face it be incredibly cold and I be try to think what would the hero do in a movie if I be write this as a movie script so I say it be really cold I have come a very long way do you mind if I come in for a minute I be freeze so the guy reluctantly let we in and we sit down on the floor and as we start talk I see he yell something and Eun Sook come and bring we some food and I have this whole mental picture of sort of like Cinderella I sort of have this picture of this incredibly wonderful bright happy little child who now appear to be very withdraw be enslave by this family and I be really appalled and I could not figure out what to do and the more I try talk to he the less friendly he be get so finally I say look this be all through the translator because you know I do not speak a word of Korean and I say look I be really glad that Eun Sook have a family to live with I be very worried about she I make a promise to she grandmother you mother that I would find a family and I be so happy that you be go to take care of she but I buy a airline ticket and I be stick here for a week I be stay in a hotel downtown would you like to come and have lunch tomorrow and you can practice you English because he tell I I be try to ask he question about himself and so I go to the hotel and I find two old Amerasians a girl whose mother have be a prostitute and she be a prostitute and a boy who have be in and out of jail and I say to they look there be a little girl who have a tiny chance of get out of here and go to America I do not know if it be the right decision or not but I would like you to come to lunch tomorrow and tell the uncle what it be like to walk down the street what person say to you what you do for a living I want he to understand what happen if she stay here and I could be wrong I do not know but I wish you would come tomorrow so this two come to lunch and we get throw out of the restaurant they be yell at he it get to be really ugly we go outside and he be just furious and I know I have totally blow this thing here I be again try to figure out what to do and he start yell at I and I say to the translator tell he to calm down what be he say and she say he be say who the hell be you to walk into my house some rich American with you camera around you neck accuse I of enslave my niece this be my niece I love she she be my sister daughter who the hell be you to accuse I of something like this and I say you know look you be absolutely right I do not pretend to understand what be go on here all I know be I have be photograph a lot of this child I be in love with you niece I think she be a incredibly special child and I say look I will fly my friend over here from the United States if you want to meet they to see if you approve of they I just think that what little I know about the situation she have very little chance here of have the kind of life that you probably would like she to have so everyone tell I afterwards that invite the prospective parent over be again the stupid thing I could have possibly do because who be ever good enough for you relative but he invite I to come to a ceremony they be have that day for she grandmother and they actually take item of clothing and photograph and they burn they as part of the ritual and you can see how different she look just in three month this be now I think early February and the picture before be take in September well there be a American Maryknoll priest that I have meet in the course of do the story who have 75 child live in he house he have three woman help he take care of this kid and so I suggest to the uncle that we go down and meet Father Keane to find out how the adoption process work because I want he to feel like this be all be do very much above board so this be on the way down to the orphanage this be Father Keane he be just a wonderful guy he have kid from all over Korea live there and he would find family for this kid this be a social worker interview Eun Sook now I have always think she be completely untouched by all of this because the grandmother to I appear to be sort of the village wise woman throughout the day I notice person keep come to visit she grandmother and I always have this mental picture that even though they may have be one of the poor family in the village they be one of the most respected and I always feel that the grandmother have kind of demand and insist that the villager treat Eun Sook with the same respect they treat she Eun Sook stay at Father Keane and she uncle agree to let she stay there until the adoption go through he actually agree to the adoption and I go off on assignment and come back a week later and Father Keane say I have get to talk to you about Eun Sook I say oh God now what and he take I into this room close the door and say I have 75 child here in the orphanage and it be total bedlam there be clothes there be kid three adult and 75 kid you can imagine and he say the second day she be here she make up a list of all of the name of the old kid and the young kid and she assign one of the old kid to each of the young kid and then she set up a work detail list of who clean the orphanage on what day and he say she be tell I that I be messy and I have to clean up my room and he say I do not know who raise she but she be run the orphanage and she be be here three day laughter this be movie day that she organize where all the kid go to the movie a lot of the kid who have be adopt write back to the other kid tell they what they life be like with they new family so it be a really big deal when the letter show up this be a woman who be now work at the orphanage whose son have be adopt gene and Gayle start study Korean the moment they have get my first letter they really want to be able to welcome Eun Sook into they family and one of the thing Father Keane tell I when I come back from one of this trip Eun Sook have choose the name Natasha which I understand be from she watch a Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon on the American Air Force station this may be one of that myth buster thing that we will have to clear up here in a minute so my friend Gene fly over with he son Tim Gayle could not come and they spend a lot of time huddle over a dictionary and this be Gene show the uncle where Atlanta be on the map where he live this be the uncle sign the adoption paper now we go out to dinner that night to celebrate the uncle go back to he family and Natasha and Tim and Gene and I go out to dinner and gene be show Natasha how to use a knife and fork and then Natasha be return the utensil lesson we go back to we hotel room and gene be show Natasha

Korean hotel the second night we do not keep the kid room because we sleep on the floor with all the kid at the orphanage and the third night we come back we would just go out to dinner where you see the picture and we get to the front desk and the guy say there be no other free room on you floor tonight you can put the kid five floor below you and Gene and I look at each other and say we do not want two 11 year old five floor away so he son say I have a sleeping bag I will sleep on the floor and I say I have one too so Tim and I sleep on the floor Natasha get one bed gene get the other kid pass out it be be very exciting for three day we be lie in bed and gene and I be talk about how cool we be we say that be so great we save this little girl life we be just like you know just full of ourselves and we fall asleep and I have be in this room for a couple of month now and they always overheat the hotel in Korea terribly so during the day I always leave the window open and then about midnight they turn the heat off in the hotel so at 1 be the whole room would be like 20 below zero and I would get up I have be do this every night I have be there so sure enough it be one o clock room freezing I go to close the window and I hear person shout outside and I think oh the bar must have just get out I do not speak Korean but I be hear this voice and I be not hear anger I be hear
