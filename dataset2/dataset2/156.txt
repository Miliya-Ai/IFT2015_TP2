there be a ancient and universal concept that word have power that spell exist and that if we could only pronounce the right word then whoosh you know a avalanche would come and wipe out the hobbit right so this be a very attractive idea because we be very lazy like the Sorcerer apprentice or the world great computer programmer this idea have a lot of traction with we we love the idea that word when pronounce be little more than pure information but they evoke physical action in the real world that help we do work so of course with lot of programmable computer and robot around this be a easy thing to picture how many of you know what I be talk about raise you right hand how many do not know what I be talk about raise you leave hand so that be great so that be too easy you guy have very insecure computer ok so now the thing be this be a different kind of spell this be a computer program make of zero and one it can be pronounce on a computer do something like this the important thing be we can write it in a high level language a computer magician can write this thing it can be compile into zero and one and pronounce by a computer and that be what make computer powerful this high level language that can be compile and so I be here to tell you you do not need a computer to actually have a spell in fact what you can do at the molecular level be that if you encode information you encode a spell or program as molecule then physics can actually directly interpret that information and run a program it be what happen in proteins when this amino acid sequence get pronounce as atom this little letter be sticky for each other it collapse into a three dimensional shape that turn it into a nanomachine that actually cut dna the interesting thing be that if you change the sequence you change the three dimensional folding you get now a dna stapler instead this be the kind of molecular program we want to be able to write the problem be we do not know the machine language of proteins or have a compiler for proteins so I have join a grow band of person that try to make molecular spell use dna we use dna because it be cheap it be easy to handle it be something we understand really well so well in fact that we think we can actually write program language for dna and have molecular compiler so then we think we can do that one of my first question do this be how can you make a arbitrary shape or pattern out of dna I decide to use a type of dna origami where you take a long strand of dna and fold it into whatever shape or pattern you might want so here be a shape I actually spend about a year in my home in my underwear code like Linus Torvalds in that picture before this program take a shape and spit out 250 dna sequence this short dna sequence be what be go to fold the long strand into this shape that we want to make so you send a e mail with this sequence in it to a company and the company pronounce they on a dna synthesizer a machine about the size of a photocopier and they take you e mail and every letter in you e mail they replace with a 30 atom cluster one for each letter a t c and g in dna they string they up in the right sequence and then they send they back to you via fedex so you get 250 of this in the mail in little tube I mix they together add a little bit of salt water and then add this long strand I be tell you about that I have steal from a virus and then what happen be you heat this whole thing up to about boil you cool it down to room temperature and as you do that short strand do the follow thing each one of they bind that long strand in one place and then have a second half that bind that long strand in a distant place and bring that two part of the long strand close together so they stick together so the net effect of all 250 of this strand be to fold the long strand into the shape you be look for it will approximate that shape we do this for real in the test tube in each little drop of water you get 50 billion of this guy with a microscope you can see they on a surface the neat thing be if you change the sequence and change the spell just change the sequence of the staple you can make a molecule that look like this and you know he like to hang out with he buddy a lot of they be actually pretty good if you change the spell again you change the sequence again you get really nice 130 nanometer triangle if you do it again you can get arbitrary pattern so on a rectangle you can paint pattern of North and South America or the word dna so that be dna origami that be one way there be many way of cast molecular spell use dna what we really want to do in the end be learn how to program self assembly so we can build anything right we want to be able to build technological artifact that be maybe good for the world we want to learn how to build biological artifact like person and whale and tree and if it be the case that we can reach that level of complexity if we ability to program molecule get to be that good then that will truly be magic thank you very much applause
