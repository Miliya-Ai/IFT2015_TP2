it be a simple idea about nature I want to say a word for nature because we have not talk that much about it the last couple day I want to say a word for the soil and the bee and the plant and the animal and tell you about a tool a very simple tool that I have find although it be really nothing more than a literary conceit it be not a technology it be very powerful for I think change we relationship to the natural world and to the other species on whom we depend and that tool be very simply as Chris suggest look at we and the world from the plant or the animal point of view it be not my idea other person have hit on it but I have try to take it to some new place let I tell you where I get it like a lot of my idea like a lot of the tool I use I find it in the garden I be a very devoted gardener and there be a day about seven year ago I be plant potato it be the first week of May this be New England when the apple tree be just vibrate with bloom they be just white cloud above I be here plant my chunk cut up potato and plant it and the bee be work on this tree bumblebee just make this thing vibrate and one of the thing I really like about gardening be that it do not take all you concentration you really can not get hurt it be not like woodworking and you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation and the question I ask myself that afternoon in the garden work alongside that bumblebee be what do I and that bumblebee have in common how be we role in this garden similar and different and I realize we actually have quite a bit in common both of we be disseminate the gene of one species and not another and both of we probably if I can imagine the bee point of view think we be call the shot I have decide what kind of potato I want to plant I have pick my Yukon Gold or Yellow Finn or whatever it be and I have summon that gene from a seed catalog across the country bring it and I be plant it and that bee no doubt assume that it have decide I be go for that apple tree I be go for that blossom I be go to get the nectar and I be go to leave we have a grammar that suggest that be who we be that we be sovereign subject in nature the bee as well as I I plant the potato i weed the garden I domesticate the species but that day it occur to I what if that grammar be nothing more than a self serve conceit because of course the bee think he be in charge or she be in charge but we know well we know that what be go on between the bee and that flower be that bee have be cleverly manipulate by that flower and when I say manipulate I be talk about in a darwinian sense right I mean it have evolve a very specific set of trait color scent flavor pattern that have lure that bee in and the bee have be cleverly fool into take the nectar and also pick up some powder on its leg and go off to the next blossom the bee be not call the shot and I realize then I be not either I have be seduce by that potato and not another into plant its into spread its gene give it a little bit more habitat and that be when I get the idea which be well what would happen if we kind of look at we from this point of view of this other species who be work on we and agriculture suddenly appear to I not as a invention not as a human technology but as a co evolutionary development in which a group of very clever species mostly edible grass have exploit we figure out how to get we to basically deforest the world the competition of grass right and suddenly everything look different and suddenly mow the lawn that day be a completely different experience I have think always and in fact have write this in my first book this be a book about gardening that lawn be nature under culture boot that they be totalitarian landscape and that when we mow they we be cruelly suppress the species and never let it set seed or die or have sex and that be what the lawn be but then I realize no this be exactly what the grass want we to do I be a dupe I be a dupe of the lawn whose goal in life be to outcompete the tree who they compete with for sunlight and so by get we to mow the lawn we keep the tree from come back which in New England happen very very quickly so I start look at thing this way and write a whole book about it call the Botany of Desire and I realize that in the same way you can look at a flower and deduce all sort of interesting thing about the taste and the desire of bee that they like sweetness that they like this color and not that color that they like symmetry what could we find out about ourselves by do the same thing that a certain kind of potato a certain kind of drug a sativa indica Cannabis cross have something to say about we and that would not this be kind of a interesting way to look at the world now the test of any idea I say it be a literary conceit be what do it get we and when you be talk about nature which be really my subject as a writer how do it meet the Aldo Leopold test which be do it make we good citizen of the biotic community get we to do thing that lead to the support and perpetuation of the biota rather than its destruction and I would submit that this idea do this so let I go through what you gain when you look at the world this way besides some entertaining insight about human desire as a intellectual matter look at the world from other species point of view help we deal with this weird anomaly which be and this be in the realm of intellectual history which be that we have this darwinian revolution 150 year ago ugh mini I laughter we have this intellectual this darwinian revolution in which thanks to Darwin we figure out we be just one species among many evolution be work on we the same way it be work on all the other we be act upon as well as act we be really in the fiber the fabric of life but the weird thing be we have not absorb this lesson 150 year later none of we really believe this we be still Cartesians the child of descarte who believe that subjectivity consciousness set we apart that the world be divide into subject and object that there be nature on one side culture on another as soon as you start see thing from the plant point of view or the animal point of view you realize that the real literary conceit be that be the idea that nature be oppose to culture the idea that consciousness be everything and that be another very important thing it do look at the world from other species point of view be a cure for the disease of human self importance you suddenly realize that consciousness which we value and we consider the crowning achievement of nature human consciousness be really just another set of tool for get along in the world and it be kind of natural that we would think it be the good tool but you know there be a comedian who say well who be tell I that consciousness be so good and so important well consciousness so when you look at the plant you realize that there be other tool and they be just as interesting I will give you two example also from the garden lima bean you know what a lima bean do when it be attack by spider mite it release this volatile chemical that go out into the world and summons another species of mite that come in and attack the spider mite defend the lima bean so what plant have while we have consciousness tool make language they have biochemistry and they have perfect that to a degree far beyond what we can imagine they complexity they sophistication be something to really marvel at and I think it be really the scandal of the Human Genome Project you know we go into it think 40 000 or 50 000 human gene and we come out with only 23 000 just to give you grounds for comparison rice 35 000 gene so who be the more sophisticated species well we be all equally sophisticated we have be evolve just as long just along different path so cure for self importance way to sort of make we feel the darwinian idea and that be really what I do as a writer as a storyteller be try to make person feel what we know and tell story that actually help we think ecologically now the other use of this be practical and I be go to take you to a farm right now because I use this idea to develop my understanding of the food system and what I learn in fact be that we be all now be manipulate by corn and the talk you hear about ethanol early today to I be the final triumph of corn over good sense laughter applause it be part of corn scheme for world domination laughter and you will see the amount of corn plant this year will be up dramatically from last year and there will be that much more habitat because we have decide ethanol be go to help we so it help I understand industrial agriculture which of course be a cartesian system it be base on this idea that we bend other species to we will and that we be in charge and that we create this factory and we have this technological input and we get the food out of it or the fuel or whatever we want let I take you to a very different kind of farm this be a farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia I go look for a farm where this idea about look at thing from the species point of view be actually implement and I find it in a man the farmer name be Joel Salatin and I spend a week as a apprentice on he farm and I take away from this some of the most hopeful news about we relationship to nature that I have ever come across in 25 year of write about nature and that be this the farm be call Polyface which mean the idea be he be get six different species of animal as well as some plant grow in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement it be permaculture that of you who know a little bit about this such that the cow and the pig and the sheep and the turkey and the what else do he have all the six different species rabbit actually be all perform ecological service for one another such that the manure of one be the lunch for the other and they take care of pest for one another it be a very elaborate and beautiful dance but I be go to just give you a close up on one piece of it and that be the relationship between he cattle and he chicken he lay hen and I will show you if you take this approach what you get ok and this be a lot more than grow food as you will see this be a different way to think about nature and a way to get away from the zero sum notion the cartesian idea that either nature win or we be win and that for we to get what we want nature be diminish so one day cattle in a pen the only technology involve here be this cheap electric fencing relatively new hooked to a car battery even I could carry a quarter acre paddock set it up in 15 minute cow graze one day they move ok they graze everything down intensive grazing he wait three day and then we tow in something call the Eggmobile the Eggmobile be a very rickety contraption it look like a prairie schooner make out of board but it house 350 chicken he tow this into the paddock three day later and open the gangplank turn they down and 350 hen come stream down the gangplank cluck gossip as chicken will and they make a beeline for the cow patty and what they be do be very interesting they be dig through the cow patty for the maggot the grub the larva of fly and the reason he be wait three day be because he know that on the fourth day or the fifth day that larva will hatch and he will have a huge fly problem but he wait that long to grow they as big and juicy and tasty as he can because they be the chicken favorite form of protein so the chicken do they kind of little breakdance and they be push around the manure to get at the grub and in the process they be spread the manure out very useful second ecosystem service and third while they be in this paddock they be of course defecate madly and they very nitrogenous manure be fertilize this field they then move out to the next one and in the course of just a few week the grass just enter this blaze of growth and within four or five week he can do it again he can graze again he can cut he can bring in another species like the lamb or he can make hay for the winter now I want you to just look really close up onto what be happen there so it be a very productive system and what I need to tell you be that on 100 acre he get 40 000 pound of beef 30 000 pound of pork 25 000 dozen egg 20 000 broiler 1 000 turkey 1 000 rabbit a immense amount of food you know you hear can organic feed the world well look how much food you can produce on 100 acre if you do this kind of again give each species what it want let it realize its desire its physiological distinctiveness put that in play but look at it from the point of view of the grass now what happen to the grass when you do this when a ruminant graze grass the grass be cut from this height to this height and it immediately do something very interesting any one of you who garden know that there be something call the root shoot ratio and plant need to keep the root mass in some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy so when they lose a lot of leaf mass they shed root they kind of cauterize they and the root die and the species in the soil go to work basically chew through that root decompose they the earthworm the fungus the bacterium and the result be new soil this be how soil be create it be create from the bottom up this be how the prairie be build the relationship between bison and grass and what I realize when I understand this and if you ask Joel Salatin what he be he will tell you he be not a chicken farmer he be not a sheep farmer he be not a cattle rancher he be a grass farmer because grass be really the keystone species of such a system be that if you think about it this completely contradict the tragic idea of nature we hold in we head which be that for we to get what we want nature be diminish more for we less for nature here all this food come off this farm and at the end of the season there be actually more soil more fertility and more biodiversity it be a remarkably hopeful thing to do there be a lot of farmer do this today this be well beyond organic agriculture which be still a cartesian system more or less and what it tell you be that if you begin to take account of other species take account of the soil that even with nothing more than this perspectival idea because there be no technology involve here except for that fence which be so cheap they could be all over Africa in no time that we can take the food we need from the Earth and actually heal the Earth in the process this be a way to reanimate the world and that be what be so exciting about this perspective when we really begin to feel Darwin insight in we bone the thing we can do with nothing more than this idea be something to be very hopeful about thank you very much
