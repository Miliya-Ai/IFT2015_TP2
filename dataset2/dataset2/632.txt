thank you I have two mission here today the first be to tell you something about pollen I hope and to convince you that it be more than just something that get up you nose and secondly to convince you that every home really ought to have a scanning electron microscope laughter pollen be a flower way of make more flower it carry male sex cell from one flower to another this give we genetic diversity or at least it give the plant genetic diversity and it be really rather good not to mate with yourself that be probably true of human as well mostly Pollen be produce by the anther of flower each anther can carry up to 100 000 grain of pollen so it be quite prolific stuff and it be not just bright flower that have pollen it be also tree and grass and remember that all we cereal crop be grass as well here be a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen the little hole in the middle we will come to a bit late but that be for the pollen tube to come out later on a very tiny tube so that be 20 micrometer across that pollen grain there that be about a 50th of a millimeter but not all pollen be quite so simple look this be Morina this be a plant which I have always think to be rather tedious name after Morin who be a enterprising French gardener who issue the first seed catalog in 1621 but anyway take a look at its pollen this be amazing I think that little hole in the middle there be for the pollen tube and when the pollen find its special female spot in another Morina flower just on the right species what happen like I say pollen carry the male sex cell if you actually do not realize that plant have sex they have rampant promiscuous and really quite interesting and curious sex really laughter a lot my story be actually not about plant propagation but about pollen itself so what be pollen property I hear you ask First of all pollen be tiny yes we know that it be also very biologically active as anyone with hay fever will understand now pollen from plant which be wind disperse like tree and grass and so on tend to cause the most hay fever and the reason for that be they have get to chuck out mass and mass of pollen to have any chance of the pollen reach another plant of the same species here be some example they be very smooth if you look at they of tree pollen that be mean to be carry by the wind again this time sycamore wind disperse so tree very boring flower not really try to attract insect cool pollen though this one I particularly like this be the Monterey Pine which have little air sack to make the pollen carry even further remember that thing be just about 30 micrometer across now it be much more efficient if you can get insect to do you bidding this be a bee leg with the pollen glomm onto it from a mallow plant and this be the outrageous and beautiful flower of the mangrove palm very showy to attract lot of insect to do its bidding the pollen have little barb on it if we look now that little barb obviously stick to the insect well but there be something else that we can tell from this photograph and that be that you might be able to see a fracture line across what would be the equator of this if it be the Earth that tell I that it be actually be fossilize this pollen and I be rather proud to say that this be find just near London and that 55 million year ago London be full of mangrove be not that cool laughter okay so this be another species evolve to be disperse by insect you can tell that from the little barb on there all this picture be take with a scanning electron microscope actually in the lab at Kew Laboratories No coincidence that this be take by Rob Kesseler who be a artist and I think it be someone with a design and artistic eye like he that have manage to bring out the good in pollen laughter now all this diversity mean that you can look at a pollen grain and tell what species it come from and that be actually quite handy if you maybe have a sample and you want to see where it come from so different species of plant grow in different place and some pollen carry further than other so if you have a pollen sample then in principle you should be able to tell where that sample come from and this be where it get interesting for forensic Pollen be tiny it get on to thing and it stick to they so not only do each type of pollen look different but each habitat have a different combination of plant a different pollen signature if you like or a different pollen fingerprint by look at the proportion and combination of different kind of pollen in a sample you can tell very precisely where it come from this be some pollen embed in a cotton shirt similar to the one that I be wear now now much of the pollen will still be there after repeat washing where have it be four very different habitat might look similar but they have get very different pollen signature actually this one be particularly easy this picture be all take in different country but pollen forensic can be very subtle it be be use now to track where counterfeit drug have be make where banknote have come from to look at the provenance of antique and see that they really do come from the place the seller say they do and murder suspect have be track use they clothing certainly in the U K to within a area that be small enough that you can send in tracker dog to find the murder victim so you can tell from a piece of clothing to within about a kilometer or so where that piece of clothing have be recently and then send in dog and finally in a rather grizzly way the Bosnia war crime some of the person bring to trial be bring to trial because of the evidence from pollen which show that body have be bury exhume and then rebury somewhere else I hope I have open you eye if you will excuse the visual pun laughter to some of pollen secret this be a horse chestnut there be a invisible beauty all around we each grain with a story to tell each of we in fact with a story to tell from the pollen fingerprint that be upon we thank you to the colleague at Kew and thank you to palynologist everywhere applause
