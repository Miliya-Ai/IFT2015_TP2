the first question be this we country have two exploration program one be NASA with a mission to explore the great beyond to explore the heaven which we all want to go to if we be lucky and you can see we have Sputnik and we have Saturn and we have other manifestation of space exploration well there be also another program in another agency within we government in ocean exploration it be in NOAA the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and my question be this why be we ignore the ocean here be the reason or not the reason but here be why I ask that question if you compare NASA annual budget to explore the heaven that one year budget would fund NOAA budget to explore the ocean for 1 600 year why why be we look up be it because it be heaven and hell be down here be it a cultural issue why be person afraid of the ocean or do they just assume the ocean be just a dark gloomy place that have nothing to offer I be go to take you on a 16 minute trip on 72 percent of the planet so buckle up ok and what we be go to do be we be go to immerse ourselves in my world and what I be go to try I hope I make the follow point I be go to make it right now in case I forget everything I be go to present to you be not in my textbook when I go to school and most of all it be not even in my college textbook I be a geophysicist and all my Earth science book when I be a student I have to give the wrong answer to get a a we use to ridicule continental drift it be something we laugh at we learn of Marshall Kay geosynclinal cycle which be a bunch of crap in today context it be a bunch of crap but it be the law of geology vertical tectonic all the thing we be go to walk through in we exploration and discovery of the ocean be mostly discovery make by accident mostly discovery make by accident we be look for something and find something else and everything we be go to talk about represent a one tenth of one percent glimpse because that be all we have see I have a characterization this be a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water it give you the false impression it be a map it be not a map in fact I have another version at my office and I ask person why be there mountain here on this area here but there be none over here and they go well gee I do not know say be it a fracture zone be it a hot spot no no that be the only place a ship be most of the southern hemisphere be unexplored we have more exploration ship down there during Captain Cook time than now it be amazing all right so we be go to immerse ourselves in the 72 percent of the planet because you know it be really naive to think that the Easter Bunny put all the resource on the continent laughter you know it be just ludicrous we be always constantly play the zero sum game you know we be go to do this we be go to take it away from something else I believe in just enrich the economy and we be leave so much on the table 72 percent of the planet and as I will point out later in the presentation 50 percent of the United States of America lie beneath the sea 50 percent of we country that we own have all legal jurisdiction have all right to do whatever we want lie beneath the sea and we have good map of Mars than that 50 percent why ok now I begin my exploration the hard way back then actually my first expedition be when I be 17 year old it be 49 year ago do the math I be 66 and I go out to sea on a Scripps ship and we almost get sink by a giant rogue wave and I be too young to be you know I think it be great I be a body surfer and I think wow that be a incredible wave and we almost sink the ship but I become enrapture with mount expedition and over the last 49 year I have do about 120 121 I keep do they expedition but in the early day the only way I could get to the bottom be to crawl into a submarine a very small submarine and go down to the bottom I dive in a whole series of different deep diving submersible Alvin and Sea Cliff and Cyana and all the major deep submersible we have which be about eight in fact on a good day we might have four or five human being at the average depth of the Earth maybe four or five human be out of whatever billion we have get go and so it be very difficult to get there if you do it physically but I be enrapture and in my graduate year be the dawn of plate tectonic and we realize that the great mountain range on Earth lie beneath the sea the mid ocean ridge run around like the seam on a baseball this be on a Mercator projection but if you be to put it on a equal area projection you would see that the mid ocean ridge cover 23 percent of the Earth total surface area almost a quarter of we planet be a single mountain range and we do not enter it until after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin go to the moon so we go to the moon play golf up there before we go to the large feature on we own planet and we interest in this mountain range as Earth scientist in that day be not only because of its tremendous size dominate the planet but the role it play in the genesis of the Earth outer skin because it be along the axis of the mid ocean ridge where the great crustal plate be separate and like a live organism you tear it open it bleed its molten blood rise up to heal that wound from the asthenosphere harden form new tissue and move laterally but no one have actually go down into the actual site of the boundary of creation as we call it into the Rift Valley until a group of seven of we crawl in we little submarine in the summer of 1973 1974 and be the first human being to enter the great rift Valley we go down into the Rift Valley this be all accurate except for one thing it be pitch black it be absolutely pitch black because photon can not reach the average depth of the ocean which be 12 000 foot in the Rift Valley it be 9 000 foot most of we planet do not feel the warmth of the sun most of we planet be in eternal darkness and for that reason you do not have photosynthesis in the deep sea and with the absence of photosynthesis you have no plant life and as a result you have very little animal life live in this underworld or so we think and so in we initial exploration we be totally focus on explore the boundary of creation look at the volcanic feature run along that entire 42 000 mile run along this entire 42 000 mile be ten of thousand of active volcano ten of thousand of active volcano there be more active volcano beneath the sea than on land by two order of magnitude so it be a phenomenally active region it be not just a dark boring place it be a very alive place and it be then be rip open but we be deal with a particular scientific issue back then we could not understand why you have a mountain under tension in plate tectonic theory we know that if you have plate collide it make sense they would crush into one another you would thicken the crust you would uplift it that be why you get you know you get seashell up on Mount Everest it be not a flood it be push up there we understand mountain under compression but we could not understand why we have a mountain under tension it should not be until one of my colleague say it look to I like a thermal blister and the mid ocean ridge must be a cool curve we say let go find out we punch a bunch of heat probe everything make sense except at the axis there be miss heat it be miss heat it be hot it be not hot enough so we come up with multiple hypothesis there be little green person down there take it there be all sort of thing go on but the only logical explanation be that there be hot spring so there must be underwater hot spring we mount a expedition to look for the missing heat and so we go along this mountain range in a area along Galapagos Rift and do we find the missing heat it be amazing this giant chimney huge giant chimney we go up to they with we submersible we want to get a temperature probe we stick it in there look at it it peg off scale the pilot make this great observation that hot laughter and then we realize we probe be make out of the same stuff it could have melt but it turn out the exit temperature be 650 degree f hot enough to melt lead this be what a real one look like on the Juan de Fuca Ridge what you be look at be a incredible pipe organ of chemical come out of the ocean everything you see in this picture be commercial grade copper lead silver zinc and gold so the Easter Bunny have put thing in the ocean floor and you have massive heavy metal deposit that we be make in this mountain range we be make huge discovery of large commercial grade ore along this mountain range but it be dwarf by what we discover we discover a profusion of life in a world that it should not exist in giant tube worm 10 foot tall I remember have to use vodka my own vodka to pickle it because we do not carry formaldehyde we go and find this incredible clam bed sit on the barren rock large clam and when we open they they do not look like a clam and when we cut they open they do not have the anatomy of a clam no mouth no gut no digestive system they body have be totally take over by another organism a bacterium that have figure out how to replicate photosynthesis in the dark through a process we now call chemosynthesis none of it in we textbook none of this in we textbook we do not know about this life system we be not predict it we stumble on it look for some missing heat so we want to accelerate this process we want to get away from this silly trip up and down on a submarine average depth of the ocean 12 000 foot two and half hour to get to work in the morning two and half hour to get to home five hour commute to work three hour of bottom time average distance travel one mile laughter on a 42 000 mile mountain range great job security but not the way to go so I begin design a new technology of telepresence use robotic system to replicate myself so I would not have to cycle my vehicle system we begin to introduce that in we exploration and we continue to make phenomenal discovery with we new robotic technology again look for something else move from one part of the mid ocean ridge to another the scientist be off watch and they come across incredible life form they come across new creature they have not see before but more importantly they discover edifice down there that they do not understand that do not make sense they be not above a magma chamber they should not be there and we call it lose City and Lost City be characterize by this incredible limestone formation and upside down pool look at that how do you do that that be water upside down we go in underneath and tap it and we find that it have the ph of Drano the ph of 11 and yet it have chemosynthetic bacterium live in it and at this extreme environment and the hydrothermal vent be in a acidic environment all the way at the other end in a alkaline environment at a ph of 11 life exist so life be much more creative than we have ever think again discover by accident just two year ago work off Santorini where person be sun themselves on the beach unbeknownst to they in the caldera nearby we find phenomenal hydrothermal vent system and more life system this be two mile from where person go to sunbathe and they be oblivious to the existence of this system again you know we stop at the water edge recently diving off in the Gulf of Mexico find pool of water this time not upside down right side up Bingo you would think you be in air until a fish swim by you be look at brine pool form by salt diapir near that be methane I have never see volcano of methane instead of belch out lava they be belch out big big bubble of methane and they be create this volcano and there be flow not of lava but of the mud come out of the Earth but drive by I have never see this before move on there be more than just natural history beneath the sea human history we discovery of the Titanic the realization that the deep sea be the large museum on Earth it contain more history than all of the museum on land combine and yet we be only now penetrate it find the state of preservation we find the Bismarck in 16 000 foot we then find the Yorktown People always ask do you find the right ship it say Yorktown on the stern laughter more recently find ancient history how many ancient mariner have have a bad day the number a million we have be discover this along ancient trade route where they be not suppose to be this shipwreck sink 100 year before the birth of Christ this one sink carry a prefabricated Home Depot Roman temple and then here be one that sink at the time of Homer at 750 b c more recently into the Black Sea where we be explore because there be no oxygen there it be the large reservoir of hydrogen sulfide on Earth Shipwrecks be perfectly preserve all they organic be perfectly preserve we begin to excavate they we expect to start haul out the body in perfect condition with they dna look at the state of preservation still the ad mark of a carpenter look at the state of that artifact you still see the beeswax drip when they drop they seal it this ship sink 1 500 year ago fortunately we have be able to convince Congress we begin to go on the Hill and lobby and we steal recently a ship from the United States Navy the Okeanos Explorer on its mission its mission be as good as you could get its mission be to go where no one have go before on planet Earth and I be look at it yesterday it be up in Seattle ok applause it come online this summer and it begin its journey of exploration but we have no idea what we be go find when we go out there with we technology but certainly it be go to be go to the unknown America this be that part of the United States that lie beneath the sea we own all of that blue and yet like I say particularly the western territorial trust we do not have map of they we do not have map of they we have map of Venus but not of the western territorial trust the way we be go to run this we have no idea what we be go to discover we have no idea what we be go to discover we be go to discover a ancient shipwreck a phoenician off Brazil or a new rock formation a new life so we be go to run it like a emergency hospital we be go to connect we command center via a high bandwidth satellite link to a building we be build at the University of Rhode Island call the Interspace Center and within that we be go to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine blue gold team switch they off and on run 24 hour a day a discovery be make that discovery be instantly see in the command center a second later but then it be connect through internet too the new internet highway that make internet one look like a dirt road on the information highway with 10 gigabit of bandwidth we will go into area we have no knowledge of it be a big blank sheet on we planet we will map it within hour have the map disseminate out to the major university it turn out that 90 percent of all the oceanographic intellect in this country be at 12 university they be all on I 2 we can then build a command center this be a remote center at the University of Washington she be talk to the pilot she be 5 000 mile away but she be assume command but the beauty of this too be we can then disseminate it to child we can disseminate they can follow this expedition I have start a program where be you Jim Jim Young who help I start a program call the Jason Project more recently we have start a program with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America so that we can use exploration and the excitement of live exploration to motivate they and excite they and then give they what they be already ready for I would not let a adult drive my robot you do not have enough gaming experience but I will let a kid with no license take over control of my vehicle system applause because we want to create we want to create the classroom of tomorrow we have stiff competition and we need to motivate and it be all be do you win or lose a engineer or a scientist by eighth grade the game be not over it be over by the eighth grade it be not begin we need to be not only proud of we university we need to be proud of we middle school and when we have the good middle school in the world we will have the good kid pump out of that system let I tell you because this be what we want this be what we want this be a young lady not watch a football game not watch a basketball game watch exploration live from thousand of mile away and it be just dawn on she what she be see and when you get a jaw drop you can inform you can put so much information into that mind it be in full receive mode applause this I hope will be a future engineer or a future scientist in the battle for truth and my final question my final question why be we not look at move out onto the sea why do we have program to build habitation on Mars and we have program to look at colonize the moon but we do not have a program look at how we colonize we own planet and the technology be at hand thank you very much applause
