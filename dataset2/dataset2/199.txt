I be go to go right into the slide and all I be go to try and prove to you with this slide be that I do just very straight stuff and my idea be in my head anyway they be very logical and relate to what be go on and problem solve for client I either convince client at the end that I solve they problem or I really do solve they problem because usually they seem to like it let I go right into the slide can you turn off the light down I like to be in the dark I do not want you to see what I be do up here laughter anyway I do this house in Santa Monica and it get a lot of notoriety in fact it appear in a porno comic book which be the slide on the right laughter this be in Venice I just show it because I want you to know I be concern about context on the left hand side I have the context of that little house and I try to build a building that fit into that context when person take picture of this building out of that context they look really weird and my premise be that they make a lot more sense when they be photograph or see in that space and then once I deal with the context I then try to make a place that be comfortable and private and fairly serene as I hope you will find that slide on the right and then I do a law school for Loyola in downtown l a i be concern about make a place for the study of law and we continue to work with this client the building on the right at the top be now under construction the garage on the right the gray structure will be tear down finally and several small classroom will be place along this avenue that we have create this campus and it all relate to the client and the student from the very first meeting say they feel deny a place they want a sense of place and so the whole idea here be to create that kind of space in downtown in a neighborhood that be difficult to fit into and it be my theory or my point of view that one do not upstage the neighborhood one make accommodation I try to be inclusive to include the building in the neighborhood whether they be build I like or not in the 60 I start work with paper furniture and make a bunch of stuff that be very successful in Bloomingdale we even make flooring wall and everything out of cardboard and the success of it throw I for a loop I could not deal with the success of furniture I be not secure enough as a architect and so I close it all up and make furniture that nobody would like laughter so nobody would like this and it be in this preliminary to this piece of furniture that Ricky and I work on furniture by the slice and after we fail I just keep fail laughter the piece on the left and that ultimately lead to the piece on the right happen when the kid that be work on this take one of that long string of stuff and fold it up to put it in the wastebasket and I put a piece of tape around it as you see there and realize you could sit on it and it have a lot of resilience and strength and so on so it be a accidental discovery I get into fish laughter I mean the story I tell be that I get mad at postmodernism at po mo and say that fish be 500 million year early than man and if you be go to go back we might as well go back to the beginning and so I start make this funny thing and they start to have a life of they own and get big as the one glass at the Walker and then I slice off the head and the tail and everything and try to translate what I be learn about the form of the fish and the movement and a lot of my architectural idea that come from it accidental again it be a intuitive kind of thing and I just keep go with it and make this proposal for a building which be only a proposal I do this building in Japan I be take out to dinner after the contract for this little restaurant be sign and I love sake and Kobe and all that stuff and after I get I be really drunk I be ask to do some sketch on napkin laughter and I make some sketch on napkin little box and Morandi like thing that I use to do and the client say why no fish and so I make a drawing with a fish and I leave Japan three week later I receive a complete set of draw say we have win the competition laughter now it be hard to do it be hard to translate a fish form because they be so beautiful perfect into a building or object like this and Oldenburg who I work with a little once in a while tell I I could not do it and so that make it even more exciting but he be right I could not do the tail I start to get the head ok but the tail I could not do it be pretty hard the thing on the right be a snake form a ziggurat and I put they together and you walk between they it be a dialog with the context again now if you see a picture of this as it be publish in architectural record they do not show the context so you would think God what a pushy guy this be but a friend of mine spend four hour wander around here look for this restaurant could not find it so laughter as for craft and technology and all that thing that you have all be talk about I be throw for a complete loop this be build in six month the way we send draw to Japan we use the magic computer in Michigan that do carve model and we use to make foam model which that thing scan we make the drawing of the fish and the scale and when I get there everything be perfect except the tail so I decide to cut off the head and the tail and I make the object on the leave for my show at the Walker and it be one of the nice piece I have ever make I think and then Jay Chiat a friend and client ask I to do he headquarters building in l a for reason we do not want to talk about it get delay toxic waste I guess be the key clue to that one and so we build a temporary building I be get good at temporary and we put a conference room in that be a fish and finally Jay drag I to my hometown Toronto Canada and there be a story it be a real story about my grandmother buy a carp on Thursday bring it home put it in the bathtub when I be a kid I play with it in the evening when I go to sleep the next day it be not there and the next night we have gefilte fish laughter and so I set up this interior for Jay office and I make a pedestal for a sculpture and he do not buy a sculpture so I make one I go around Toronto and find a bathtub like my grandmother and I put the fish in it be a joke laughter I play with funny person like Claes Oldenburg we have be friend for a long time and we have start to work on thing a few year ago we do a performance piece in Venice Italy call Il Corso del Coltello the Swiss Army knife and most of the imagery be laughter cla but that two little boy be my son and they be Claes assistant in the play he be the Swiss Army knife he be a souvenir salesman who always want to be a painter and I be Frankie P Toronto p for Palladio dress up like the at t building by Claes laughter with a fish hat the highlight of the performance be at the end this beautiful object the Swiss Army knife which I get credit for participate in and I can tell you it be totally a Oldenburg I have nothing to do with it the only thing I do be I make it possible for they to turn that blade so you could sail this thing in the canal because I love sail laughter we make it into a sailing craft I have be know to mess with thing like chain link fencing I do it because it be a curious thing in the culture when thing be make in such great quantity absorb in such great quantity and there be so much denial about they People hate it and I be fascinate with that which like the paper furniture it be one of that material and I be always draw to that and so I do a lot of dirty thing with chain link which nobody will forgive I for but Claes make homage to it in the Loyola Law School and that chain link be really expensive it be in perspective and everything and then we do a camp together for child with cancer and you can see we start make a building together of course the milk can be he but we be try to collide we idea to put object next to each other like a Morandi like the little bottle compose they like a still life and it seem to work as a way to put he and I together then Jay Chiat ask I to do this building on this funny lot in Venice and I start with this three piece thing and you enter in the middle and Jay ask I what I be go to do with the piece in the middle and he push that and one day I have a oh well the other way I have the binoculars from Claes and I put they there and I could never get rid of they after that Oldenburg make the binoculars incredible when he send I the first model of the real proposal it make my building look sick and it be this interaction between that kind of up the ante stuff that become pretty interesting it lead to the building on the left and I still think the Time magazine picture will be of the binoculars you know leave out the what the hell I use a lot of metal in my work and I have a hard time connect with the craft the whole thing about my house the whole use of rough carpentry and everything be the frustration with the craft available I say if I can not get the craft that I want I will use the craft I can get there be plenty of model for that in Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns and many artist who be make beautiful art and sculpture with junk material I go into the metal because it be a way of build a building that be a sculpture and it be all of one material and the metal could go on the roof as well as the wall the metalworker for the most part do duct behind the ceiling and stuff I be give a opportunity to design a exhibit for the metalworker union of America and Canada in Washington and I do it on the condition that they become my partner in the future and help I with all future metal building etc etc and it be work very well to have this person this craftsman interested in it I just tell the story it be a way of connect at least with some of that person that be so important to the realization of architecture the metal continue into a building Herman Miller in Sacramento and it be just a complex of factory building and Herman Miller have this philosophy of have a place a person place I mean it be kind of a trite thing to say but it be real that they want to have a central place where the cafeteria would be where the person would come and where the person work would interact so it be out in the middle of nowhere and you approach it it be copper and galvanize I use the galvanize and copper in a very light gauge so it would buckle I spend a lot of time undo Richard Meier aesthetic everybody be try to get the panel perfect and I always try to get they sloppy and fuzzy and they end up look like stone this be the central area there be a ramp and that little dome in there be a building by Stanley Tigerman Stanley be instrumental in my get this job and when I be award the contract I at the very beginning ask the client if they would let Stanley do a cameo piece with I because this be idea that we be talk about build thing next to each other make it be all about a metaphor for a city maybe and so Stanley do the little dome thing and we do it over the phone and by fax he would send I a fax and show I something he have make a building with a dome and he have a little tower I tell he no no that be too ongepotchket I do not want the tower so he come back with a simple building but he put some funny detail on it and he move it close to my building and so I decide to put he in a depression I put he in a hole and make a kind of a hole that he sit in and so then he put two bridge this all happen on the fax go back and forth over a couple of week period and he put this two bridge with pink guardrail on it and so then I put this big billboard behind it and I call it David and Goliath and that be my cafeteria in Boston we have that old building on the leave it be a very prominent building off the freeway and we add a floor and clean it up and fix it up and use the kind of I think the language of the neighborhood which have this cornice project cornice mine get a little exuberant but I use lead copper which be a beautiful material and it turn green in 100 year instead of like copper in 10 or 15 we redo the side of the building and re proportion the window so it sort of fit into the space and it surprise both Boston and myself that we get it approve because they have very strict kind of design guideline and they would not normally think I would fit they the detail be very careful with the lead copper and make panel and fit it tightly into the fabric of the exist building in Barcelona on Las Ramblas for some film festival I do the Hollywood sign go and come make a building out of it and they build it I fly in one night and take this picture but they make it a third small than my model without tell I and then more metal and some chain link in Santa Monica a little shopping center and this be a laser laboratory at the University of Iowa in which the fish come back as a abstraction in the back it be the support lab which by some coincidence require no window and the shape fit perfectly I just join the point in the curved part there be all the mechanical equipment that solid wall behind it be a pipe chase a pipe canyon and so it be a opportunity that I seize because I do not have to have any protrude duct or vent or thing in this form it give I a opportunity to make a sculpture out of it this be a small house somewhere they have be build it so long I do not remember where it be it be in the West Valley and we start with the stream and build the house along the stream dam it up to make a lake this be the model the reality with the lake the workmanship be pretty bad and it remind I why I play defensively in thing like my house when you have to do something really cheaply it be hard to get perfect corner and stuff that big metal thing be a passage and in it be you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom which be on the right it be kind of like a whole build town I be ask to do a hospital for schizophrenic adolescent at Yale I think it be fit for I to be do that this be a house next to a Philip Johnson house in Minnesota the owner have a dilemma they ask Philip to do it he be too busy he do not recommend I by the way laughter we end up have to make it a sculpture because the dilemma be how do you build a building that do not look like the language be it go to look like this beautiful estate be sub divide etc etc you have get the idea and so we finally end up make it this person be art collector and we finally make it so it appear very sculptural from the main house and all the window be on the other side and the building be very sculptural as you walk around it it be make of metal and the brown stuff be fin ply it be that form lumber from Finland we use it at Loyola on the chapel and it do not work I keep try to make it work in this case we learn how to detail it in Cleveland there be Burnham Mall on the leave it be never be finish go out to the lake you can see all that new building we build and we have the opportunity to build a building on this site there be a railroad track this be the city hall over here somewhere and the courthouse and the centerline of the mall go out Burnham have design a railroad station that be never build and so we follow Sohio be on the axis here and we follow the axis and they be two kind of goalpost and this be we build which be a corporate headquarters for a insurance company we collaborate with Oldenburg and put the newspaper on top fold the health club be fasten to the garage with a c clamp for cleveland laughter you drive down so it be about a 10 story c clamp and all this stuff at the bottom be a museum and a idea for a very fancy automobile entry this owner have a pet peeve about bad automobile entry and this would be a hotel so the centerline of this thing we have preserve it and it would start to work with the scale of the new building by Pelli and Kohn Pederson Fox etc that be underway it be hard to do high rise I feel much more comfortable down here this be a piece of property in Brentwood and a long time ago about 82 or something after my house I design a house for myself that would be a village of several pavilion around a courtyard and the owner of this lot work for I and build that actual model on the left and she come back I guess wealthy or something something happen and ask I to design a house for she on this site and follow that basic idea of the village we change it as we get into it I lock the house into the site by cut the back end here you see on the photograph of the site slicing into it and put all the bathroom and dress room like a retain wall create a low level zone for the master bedroom which I design like a kind of a barge look like a boat and that be it build the dome be a request from the client she want a dome somewhere in the house she do not care where when you sleep in this bedroom I hope I mean I have not sleep in it yet I have offer to marry she so I could sleep there but she say I do not have to do that but when you be in that room you feel like you be on a kind of barge on some kind of lake and it be very private the landscape be be build around to create a private garden and then up above there be a garden on this side of the living room and one on the other side this be not focus very well I do not know how to do it from here focus the one on the right it be up there leave it be my right anyway you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of tree that be the living room servant quarter a guest bedroom which have this dome with marble on it and then you enter into the living room and then so on this be the bedroom you come down from this level along the stairway and you enter the bedroom here go into the lake and the bed be back in this space with window look out onto the lake this Stonehenge thing be design to give foreground and to create a great depth in this shallow lot the material be lead copper like in the building in Boston and so it be a intent to make this small piece of land it be 100 by 250 into a kind of a estate by separate this area and make the living room and dining room into this pavilion with a high space in it and this happen by accident that I get this right on axis with the dining room table it look like I get a Baldessari painting for free but the idea be the window be all place so you see piece of the house outside eventually this will be screen this tree will come up and it will be very private and you feel like you be in you own kind of village this be for Michael Eisner Disney we be do some work for he and this be in Anaheim California and it be a freeway building you go under this bridge at about 65 mile a hour and there be another bridge here and you be through this room in a split second and the building will sort of reflect that on the backside it be much more humane entrance dining hall etc and then this thing here I be hope as you drive by you will hear the picket fence effect of the sound hit it kind of a fun thing to do I be do a building in Switzerland Basel which be a office building for a furniture company and we struggle with the image this be the early study but they have to sell furniture to normal person so if I do the building and it be too fancy then person might say well the furniture look ok in he thing but no it be not go to look good in my normal building so we have make a kind of pragmatic slab in the second phase here and we have take the conference facility and make a villa out of they so that the communal space be very sculptural and separate and you be look at it from the office and you create a kind of interaction between this piece this be in Paris along the Seine Palais des Sports the Gare de Lyon over here the Minister of Finance the guy that move from the Louvre go in here there be a new library across the river and back in here in this already treed park we be do a very dense building call the American Center which have a theater apartment dance school a art museum restaurant and all kind of it be a very dense program bookstore etc in a very tight small this be the ground level and the French have this extraordinary way of screw thing up by take a beautiful site and cut the corner off they call it the plan coupe and I struggle with that thing how to get around the corner this be the model for it I show you the other model the one this be the way I organize myself so I could make the drawing so I understand the problem I be try to get around this plan coupe how do you do it Apartments etc and this be the kind of study model we do and the one on the left be pretty awful you can see why I be ready to commit suicide when this one be build but out of it come finally this resolution where the elevator piece work frontally to this parallel to this street and also parallel to here and then this kind of twist with this balcony and the skirt kind of like a ballerina lift she skirt to let you into the foyer the restaurant here the apartment and the theater etc so it would all be build in stone in French limestone except for this metal piece and it face into a park and the idea be to make this express the energy of this on the side face the street it be much more normal except I slip a few mansard down so that come on the point this housing unit make a gesture to the corner and this will be some kind of high tech billboard if any of you guy have any idea for it please contact I I do not know what to do Jay Chiat be a glutton for punishment and he hire I to do a house for he in the Hamptons and it be get a fish and I keep think this be go to be the last fish it be like a drug addict I say I be not go to do it anymore I do not want to do it anymore I be not go to do it and then I do it laughter there it be but it be the living room and this piece here be I do not know what it be I just add it so that we would have enough money in the budget so we could take something out applause this be Euro Disney and I have work with all of the guy that present to you early we have have a lot of fun work together I think I be from Mars for they and they be for I but somehow we all manage to work together and I think productively so far this be a shopping thing you come into the Magic Kingdom and the hotel that Tony Baxter group be do out here and then this be a kind of a shopping mall with a rodeo and restaurant and another restaurant what I do because of the Paris sky be quite dull I make a light grid that be perpendicular to the train station to the route of the train it look like it be kind of be there and then crash all this simple form into it the light grid will have a light be light up at night and give a kind of light ceiling in Switzerland Germany actually on the Rhine across from Basel we do a furniture factory and a furniture museum and I try to there be a Nick Grimshaw building over here there be a Oldenburg sculpture over here I try to make a relationship urbanistically and I do not give good slide to show it be just be complete but this piece here be this building and this piece here and here and as you pass by it be always part you see it as all of this piece accrue and become part of a overall neighborhood it be plaster and just zinc and you wonder if this be a museum what it be go to be like inside if it be go to be so busy and crazy that you would not show anything and just wait I be so cunning and clever I make it quiet and wonderful but on the outside it do scream out at you a bit it be actually basically three square room with a couple of skylight and stuff and from the building in the back you see it as a iceberg float by in the hill I know I be over time see that skylight go down and become that one so it be pretty quiet inside this be the Disney Hall the concert hall it be a complicated project it have a chamber hall it be relate to a exist Chandler Pavilion that be build with a lot of love and tear and care and it be not a great building but I approach it optimistically that we would make a compositional relationship between we that would strengthen both of we and the plan of this it be a concert hall this be the foyer which be kind of a garden structure there be commercial at the ground floor this be office which really in the competition we do not have to design but finally there be a hotel there this be the kind of relationship make to the Chandler compose this elevation together and relate they to the building that exist to MOCA etc the acoustician in the competition give we criterion which lead to this compartmentalize scheme which we find out after the competition would not work at all but everybody like this form and like the space and so that be one of the problem of a competition you have to then try and get that back in some way and we study many model this be we original model this be the three building that be the ideal the Concertgebouw Boston and Berlin everybody like the surround actually this be the small hall in size and it have more seat than any of this because it have double balcony we client do not want balcony so and when we meet we new acoustician he tell we this be the right shape or this be the right shape and we try many shape try to get the energy of the original design within a acoustical acceptable format we finally settle on a shape that be the proportion of the Concertgebouw with the slope outside wall which the acoustician say be crucial to this and later decide they be not but now we have they laughter and we idea be to make the seating carriage very sculptural and out of wood and like a big boat sit in this plaster room that be the idea and the corner would have skylight and this column would be structural and the nice thing about introduce column be they give you a kind of sense of proscenium from wherever you sit and create intimacy now this be not a final design this be just on the way to be and so I would not take it literally except the feeling of the space we study the acoustic with laser stuff and they bounce they off this and see where it all work but you get the sense of the hall in section most hall come straight down into a proscenium in this case we be open it back up and get skylight in the four corner and so it will be quite a different shape laughter the original building because it be frog like fit nicely on the site and crank itself well when you get into a box it be hard to do it and here we be struggle with how to put the hotel in and this be a teapot I design for Alessi I just stick it on there but this be how I do work I do take piece and bit and look at it and struggle with it and cut it away and of course it be not go to look like that but it be the crazy way I tend to work and then finally in l a i be ask to do a sculpture at the foot of Interstate Bank Tower the high building in L A Larry Halprin be do the stair and I be ask to do a fish and so I do a snake laughter it be a public space and I make it kind of a garden structure and you can go in it it be a kiva and Larry put some water in there and it work much good than a fish in Barcelona I be ask to do a fish and we be work on that at the foot of a Ritz Carlton Tower be do by Skidmore Owings and Merrill and the Ritz Carlton Tower be be design with expose steel non fire proof much like that old gas tank and so we take the language of this expose steel and use it pervert it into the form of the fish and create a kind of a 19th century contraption that look like that will sit this be the beach and the harbor out in front and this be really a shopping center with department store and we split this bridge originally this be all solid with a hole in it we cut they loose and make several bridge and create a kind of a foreground for this hotel we show this to the hotel person the other day and they be terrify and say that nobody would come to the Ritz Carlton anymore because of this fish laughter and finally I just throw this in Lou Danziger I do not expect Lou Danziger to be here but this be a building I do for he in 1964 I think a little studio and it be sadly for sale time go on and this be my son work with I on a small fast food thing he design the robot as the cashier and the head move and I do the rest of it and the food be not as good as the stuff and so it fail it should have be the other way around the food should have be good first it do not work thank you very much
