I do not speak English I start speak English learn English about a year ago I speak French and I grow up with French so my English be Franglais I be bear in the western Congo in a area around here and then go to university in Kisangani and after I finish I go to this area the Ituri Forest but what I have be do when I be about 14 I grow in my uncle house and my father be a soldier and my uncle be a fisherman and also a poacher what I have be do from 14 to 17 be I be assist they collect ivory tusk meat and whatever they be kill poach hunting in the forest bring it in the main city to get access to the market but finally I get myself involved around 17 to 20 year I become myself a poacher and I want to do it because I believe to continue my study I want to go to university but my father be poor my uncle even so I do it and for three to four year I go to university for three time I apply to biomedical science to be a doctor I do not succeed I be have my inscription my admission to biology and I say no way I be not do it my family poor my area do not have good health care I want to be a doctor to serve they three time that mean three year and I start get old I say oh no I continue so I do tropical ecology and plant botany when I finish I go to the Ituri Forest for my internship it be where I really get passion with what I be do right up to now I be stand in front of you do botany and wildlife conservation that time the Ituri Forest be create as a forest reserve with some animal and also plant and the training center there be build around the scientific Congolese staff and some American scientist also so the Okapi Faunal Reserve protect number I think that be the large number of elephant we have right now in protect area in Congo it have also chimpanzee and it have be name Okapi Faunal Reserve because of this beautiful creature that be a forest giraffe I think you guy know it quite well here we have savanna giraffe but through evolution we have this forest giraffe that live only in Congo it have also some beautiful primate thirteen species high diversity we can find in one single area in Africa and it have the Ituri Forest itself about 1 300 species of plant so far know I join the Wildlife Conservation Society work there in 1995 but I start work with they as a student in 1991 I be appoint as a teaching assistant at my university because I accomplish with honor but I do not like the way the instruction I get be very poor and I want to be form to a training center and a research center with the end of the dictatorship regime of Mobutu Sese Seko that most of you know life become very very difficult and the work we have be do be completely difficult to do and to achieve it when Kabila start he movement to liberate Congo so Mobutu soldier start move and retreat so they start flee from the east to the west and the Okapi Faunal Reserve be there so there be a road from Goma somewhere here and come like this so they might go through pass through the Okapi Faunal Reserve Congo have five of the world rich site of protect area and the Okapi Faunal Reserve be one of they so soldier be flee in the Okapi Faunal Reserve on they way they loot everything torture war oh my god you can not believe every person be look he way where to go we do not know and it be for we the young the first time really we hear the language of war of gun and even person who face the rebellion of 1963 after we independence they do not believe what be happen they be kill person they be do whatever they want because they have power who have be do that young child child soldier you can not ask he how old he be because he have gun but I be from the west work in the east I even at that time be not speak Swahili and when they come they loot everything you can not speak Lingala because Lingala be from Mobutu and everyone speak Lingala be soldier and I be from the same area to he all my friend say we be leave because we be a target but I be not go to the east because I do not know Swahili I stay if I go I will be kill I can not go back to my area it be more than 1 000 kilometer away I stay after they loot everything we have be do research on botany and we have a small herbarium of 4 500 sheet of plant we cut we dry and we pack they we mount they on a folder purpose so that we start they for agriculture for medicine for whatever and for science for the study of the flora and the change of the forest that be person move around that be even Pygmies and this be a bright guy hard work person and pygmy I have be work with he about 10 year and with soldier they go to the forest for poach elephant because he be pygmy he know how to track elephant in the forest he have be attack by a leopard and they abandon he in the forest they come to tell I I have to save he and what I do I give he just antibiotic that we care for tuberculosis and fortunately I save he life and that be the language of the war everywhere there have be constant extraction of mineral kill animal the log timber and so on and what of important thing I think all of you here have a cell phone that mineral have kill a lot five million of Congolese have go because of this Colombo Tantalite they call it Coltan that they use it to make cell phone and it have be in that area all over in Congo extraction and good big business of the war and what I do for the first war after we have lose everything I have to save something even myself my life and life of the staff I bury some of we new vehicle engine I bury it to save it and some of equipment go with they on the top of the canopy to save it he be not collect plant he be go to save we equipment on the canopy and with the material that be leave because they want to destroy it to burn it they do not understand it they do not go to school I pack it and that be I go to hurry to Uganda to try to save that 4 000 material with person carry they on the bike bicycle and after that we succeed I house that 4 000 material at the herbarium of Makerere University and after the war I have be able to bring it back home so that we continue we study the second war come while we do not expect it with friend we have be sit and watch match football and have some good music with WorldSpace radio when it start I think so it be so bad we hear that now from the east again the war start and it be go fast this time I think Kabila will go in place of as he do with Mobutu and the reserve be a target to the rebel three different movement and two militia act in the same area and compete for natural resource and there be no way to work they destroy everything poach oh no way and that be the powerful man we have to meet and to talk to they what be the regulation of the reserve and what be the regulation of the park and they can not do what they be do so we go to meet they that be Coltan extraction gold mining so we start talk with they convince they that we be in a protect area there be regulation that it be prohibit to do log mining and poach specifically but they say you guy you think that soldier who be die be not important and you animal you be protect be most important we do not think so we have to do it because to let we movement advance I say no way you be not go to do it here we start talk with they and I be negotiate try to protect we equipment try to protect we staff and the village of about 1 500 person and we continue but I be do that negotiating with they sometimes we be have meeting and they be talk with Jean Pierre Bemba with Mbusa Nyamwisi with Kabila and I be there sometimes they talk to my own language that be Lingala I hear it and what strategy they be do what they be plan sometimes they be have a helicopter to supply they with ammunition and so on they use I to carry that and I be do count what come from where and where and where I have only this equipment my satellite phone my computer and a plastic solar panel that I hide it in the forest and every time daily after we have meet what compromise we have whatever I go I write a short email send it I do not know how many person I have on my address I send the message what be go about the progress of the war and what they be plan to do they start suspect that what we do on the morning and the afternoon it be on the news BBC RFI laughter something might be go on and one day we go for a meeting applause sorry one day we go to meet the Chief Commander he have the same iridium cell phone like I and he ask I do you know how to use this I say I have never see it laughter I do not know and I have mine on my pocket so it be a chance that they trust I a lot they do not they be not look on I so I be scared and when we finish the meeting I go to return it in the forest and I be send news do whatever report daily to the u n to UNESCO to we institution in New York what have be go and for that they have be have big pressure to leave to free the area because there be no way whatever they do it be know the same time during the first two rebellion they kill all animal in the zoo we have a zoo of 14 Okapis and one of they be pregnant and during the war after a week of heavy war fighting in the area we succeed we have the first Okapi this be the only trouser and shirt remind I of this this be not local population this be rebel they be now happy send the news that they have protect the Okapi with the war because we send the news that they be kill and poach everywhere after a week we celebrate the birthday of that okapi they kill a elephant just 50 meter to the area where the zoo where Okapi be bear and I be mad I oppose it that they be now go to dissect it until I do my report and then I see the Chief Commander and I succeed the elephant just decay and they just get the tusk what we be do after that that be the situation of the war we have to rebuild I have some money I be pay 150 dollar I devote half of it to rebuild the herbarium because we do not have good infrastructure to start plant Wildlife Conservation Society more deal with plant I start this with 70 dollar and start fundraising money to where I have be go I have opportunity to go all over where herbarium for my African material be and they support I a bit and I build this now it be do work to train young Congolese and also what one of the speciality we be do my design be track the global warming effect on biodiversity and what the impact of the Ituri Forest be play to uptake carbon this be one of the study we be do on a 40 hectare plot where we have tag tree and liana from one centimeter and we be track they we have now datum of about 15 year to see how that forest be contribute to the carbon reduction and that be I think it be difficult for I this be a very embarrassing talk I know I do not know where to start where to finish it when I be think to come here what good title I want to say to my talk I do not find this but now I think that I would have title it the Language of Guns where be you person now we be talk about reconstitution rebuild Africa but be gun industry a tool to rebuild or be it a game I think we see the war like a game like soccer football everybody be happy but see what it be do see what be go in Darfur now we say oh my God see what the war in Rwanda that be because of the language of gun I do not think that someone may blame Google because it be do the right thing even if person like Al Qaeda be use Google to connect between they but it be serve million for the good but what be do with gun industry thank you applause Chris Anderson thank you thank you just wait over there it be a amazing story I suspect a lot of person here have the same question I have how can we help you Corneille Ewango that be really embarrassing question I think that now I feel nervous and I think help we person be act sometimes by ignorance I do it myself if I know when I be young that by kill a elephant I be destroy biodiversity I would not have do it many many of you have see the talent of African but there be few who be go to school many be die because of all that kind of pandemic HIV malaria poverty not go to school what you can assist we it be by build capacity how many have get opportunity like I to go to U S do a master and go now I be in the Netherlands to do a ph d but many of they be just here because they do not have money and they can not go even to university they can not even attain the bachelor degree building capacity for the young generation be go to make a good generation and a good future tomorrow for Africa CA thank you thank you applause
