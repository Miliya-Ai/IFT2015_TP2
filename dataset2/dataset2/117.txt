how many Creationists do we have in the room probably none I think we be all Darwinians and yet many Darwinians be anxious a little uneasy would like to see some limit on just how far the darwinism go it be all right you know spiderweb sure they be product of evolution the world wide web not so sure Beaver dam yes Hoover Dam no what do they think it be that prevent the product of human ingenuity from be themselves fruit of the tree of life and hence in some sense obey evolutionary rule and yet person be interestingly resistant to the idea of apply evolutionary thinking to think to we think and so I be go to talk a little bit about that keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here so you be out in the wood or you be out in the pasture and you see this ant crawl up this blade of grass it climb up to the top and it fall and it climb and it fall and it climb try to stay at the very top of the blade of grass what be this ant do what be this in aid of what goal be this ant try to achieve by climb this blade of grass what be in it for the ant and the answer be nothing there be nothing in it for the ant well then why be it do this be it just a fluke yeah it be just a fluke it be a lancet fluke it be a little brain worm it be a parasitic brain worm that have to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow in order to continue its life cycle Salmon swim upstream to get to they spawning grounds and lancet fluke commandeer a passing ant crawl into its brain and drive it up a blade of grass like a all terrain vehicle so there be nothing in it for the ant the ant brain have be hijack by a parasite that infect the brain induce suicidal behavior pretty scary well do anything like that happen with human being this be all on behalf of a cause other than one own genetic fitness of course well it may already have occur to you that Islam mean surrender or submission of self interest to the will of Allah well it be idea not worm that hijack we brain now be I say that a sizable minority of the world population have have they brain hijack by parasitic idea no it be bad than that most person have laughter there be a lot of idea to die for Freedom if you be from New Hampshire laughter Justice Truth Communism many person have lay down they life for communism and many have lay down they life for capitalism and many for Catholicism and many for Islam this be just a few of the idea that be to die for they be infectious yesterday Amory Lovins speak about infectious repititis it be a term of abuse in effect this be unthinking engineering well most of the cultural spread that go on be not brilliant new out of the box think it be infectious repetitis and we might as well try to have a theory of what be go on when that happen so that we can understand the condition of infection host work hard to spread this idea to other I myself be a philosopher and one of we occupational hazard be that person ask we what the meaning of life be and you have to have a bumper sticker you know you have to have a statement so this be mine the secret of happiness be find something more important than you be and dedicate you life to it most of we now that the Me Decade be well in the past now we actually do this one set of idea or another have simply replace we biological imperative in we own life this be what we summum bonum be it be not maximize the number of grandchild we have now this be a profound biological effect it be the subordination of genetic interest to other interest and no other species do anything at all like it well how be we go to think about this it be on the one hand a biological effect and a very large one unmistakable now what theory do we want to use to look at this well many theory but how could something tie they together the idea of replicate idea idea that replicate by pass from brain to brain Richard Dawkins whom you will be hear later in the day invent the term meme and put forward the first really clear and vivid version of this idea in he book the selfish gene now here be I talk about he idea well you see it be not he yes he start it but it be everybody idea now and he be not responsible for what I say about meme I be responsible for what I say about meme actually I think we be all responsible for not just the intend effect of we idea but for they likely misuse so it be important I think to Richard and to I that this idea not be abuse and misuse they be very easy to misuse that be why they be dangerous and it be just about a full time job try to prevent person who be scared of this idea from caricature they and then run off to one dire purpose or another so we have to keep plug away try to correct the misapprehension so that only the benign and useful variant of we idea continue to spread but it be a problem we do not have much time and I be go to go over just a little bit of this and cut out because there be a lot of other thing that be go to be say so let I just point out meme be like virus that be what Richard say back in 93 and you might think well how can that be I mean a virus be you know it be stuff what be a meme make of yesterday Negroponte be talk about viral telecommunications but what be a virus a virus be a string of nucleic acid with attitude laughter that be there be something about it that tend to make it replicate good than the competition do and that be what a meme be it be a information packet with attitude what be a meme make of what be bit make of mom not silicon they be make of information and can be carry in any physical medium what be a word make of sometimes when person say do meme exist I say well do word exist be they in you ontology if they be word be meme that can be pronounced then there be all the other meme that can not be pronounced there be different species of meme remember the shaker gift to be simple simple beautiful furniture and of course they be basically extinct now and one of the reason be that among the creed of Shaker dom be that one should be celibate not just the priest everybody well it be not so surprising that they have go extinct laughter but in fact that be not why they go extinct they survive as long as they do at a time when the social safety net be not there and there be lot of widow and orphan person like that who need a foster home and so they have a ready supply of convert and they could keep it go and in principle it could have go on forever with perfect celibacy on the part of the host the idea be pass on through proselytize instead of through the gene line so the idea can live on in spite of the fact that they be not be pass on genetically a meme can flourish in spite of have a negative impact on genetic fitness after all the meme for Shaker dom be essentially a sterilize parasite there be other parasite that do this which render the host sterile it be part of they plan they do not have to have mind to have a plan I be just go to draw you attention to just one of the many implication of the memetic perspective which I recommend I have not time to go into more of it in Jared Diamond wonderful book gun germ and steel he talk about how it be germ more than gun and steel that conquer the new hemisphere the western hemisphere that conquer the rest of the world when European explorer and traveler spread out they bring with they the germ that they have become essentially immune to that they have learn how to tolerate over hundred and hundred of year thousand of year of live with domesticate animal who be the source of that pathogen and they just wipe out this pathogen just wipe out the native person who have no immunity to they at all and we be do it again we be do it this time with toxic idea yesterday a number of person Nicholas Negroponte and other speak about all the wonderful thing that be happen when we idea get spread out thanks to all the new technology all over the world and I agree it be largely wonderful largely wonderful but among all that idea that inevitably flow out into the whole world thanks to we technology be a lot of toxic idea now this have be realize for some time Sayyid Qutb be one of the founding father of fanatical Islam one of the ideologue that inspire Osama bin Laden One have only to glance at its press film fashion show beauty contest ballroom wine bar and broadcasting station meme this meme be spread around the world and they be wipe out whole culture they be wipe out language they be wipe out tradition and practice and it be not we fault anymore than it be we fault when we germ lay waste to person that have not develop the immunity we have a immunity to all of the junk that lie around the edge of we culture we be a free society so we let pornography and all this thing we shrug they off they be like a mild cold they be not a big deal for we but we should recognize that for many person in the world they be a big deal and we should be very alert to this as we spread we education and we technology one of the thing that we be do be we be the vector of meme that be correctly view by the host of many other meme as a dire threat to they favorite meme the meme that they be prepared to die for well now how be we go to tell the good meme from the bad meme that be not the job of the science of memetic memetic be morally neutral and so it should be this be not the place for hate and anger if you have have a friend who be die of AIDS then you hate HIV but the way to deal with that be to do science and understand how it spread and why in a morally neutral perspective get the fact work out the implication there be plenty of room for moral passion once we have get the fact and can figure out the good thing to do and as with germ the trick be not to try to annihilate they you will never annihilate the germ what you can do however be foster public health measure and the like that will encourage the evolution of avirulence that will encourage the spread of relatively benign mutation of the most toxic variety that be all the time I have so thank you very much for you attention
