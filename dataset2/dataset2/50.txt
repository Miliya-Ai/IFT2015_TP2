let I show you some image of what I consider to be the city of tomorrow so that be Kibera the large squatter community in Nairobi this be the squatter community in Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Bombay India what be call Mumbai this day this be Hosinia the large and most urbanized favela in Rio de Janeiro and this be Sultanbelyi which be one of the large squatter community in Istanbul they be what I consider to be the city of tomorrow the new urban world now why do I say that to tell you about that I have to talk about this fellow here he name be Julius and I meet Julius the last week that I be live in Kibera so I have be there almost three month and I be tour around the city go to different squatter area and Julius be tag along and he be bug eyed and at certain point we be walk around he grab my hand for support which be something most Kenyan would never consider do they be very polite and they do not get so forward so quickly and I find out later that it be Julius first day in Nairobi and he be one of many so close to 200 000 person a day migrate from the rural to the urban area that be and I be go to be fair to the statistician who talk this morning not almost 1 5 million person a week but almost 1 4 million person a week but I be a journalist and we exaggerate so almost 1 5 million person a week close to 70 million person a year and if you do the math that be 130 person every minute so that will be in the 18 minute that I be give to talk here between two and three thousand person will have journey to the city and here be the statistics today a billion squatter one in six person on the planet 2030 two billion squatter one in four person on the planet and the estimate be that in 2050 there will be three billion squatter good than one in three person on earth so this be the city of the future and we have to engage they and I be think this morning of the good life and before I show you the rest of my presentation I be go to violate TED rule here and I be go to read you something from my book as quickly as I can because I think it say something about reverse we perception of what we think the good life be so the hut be make of corrugated metal set on a concrete pad it be a 10 by 10 cell Armstrong O Brian Jr share it with three other man Armstrong and he friend have no water they buy it from a nearby tap owner no toilet the family in this compound share a single pit latrine and no sewer or sanitation they do have electricity but it be illegal service tap from someone else wire and could only power one feeble bulb this be Southland a small shanty community on the western side of Nairobi Kenya but it could have be anywhere in the city because more than half the city of Nairobi live like this 1 5 million person stuff into mud or metal hut with no service no toilet no right Armstrong explain the brutal reality of they situation they pay 1 500 shilling in rent about 20 buck a month a relatively high price for a Kenyan shantytown and they could not afford to be late with the money in case you owe one month the landlord will come with he henchman and bundle you out he will confiscate you thing Armstrong say not one month one day he roommate Hilary Kibagendi Onsomu who be cook ugali the spongy white cornmeal concoction that be the staple food in the country cut into the conversation they call they landlord a Wabenzi meaning that he be a person who have enough money to drive a Mercedes Benz Hilary serve the ugali with a fry of meat and tomato the sun slam down on the thin steel roof and we perspire as we eat after we finish Armstrong straighten he tie put on a wool sport jacket and we head out into the glare outside a mound of garbage form the border between Southland and the adjacent legal neighborhood of Langata it be perhaps eight foot tall 40 foot long and 10 foot wide and it be set in a wide watery ooze as we pass two boy be climb the mount Kenya of trash they could not have be more than five or six year old they be barefoot and with each step they toe sink into the muck send hundred of fly scatter from the rancid pile I think they might be play King of the Hill but I be wrong once atop the pile one of the boy lower he shorts squat and defecate the fly buzz hungrily around he leg when 20 family 100 person or so share a single latrine a boy poop on a garbage pile be perhaps no big thing but it stand in jar contrast to something Armstrong have say as we be eat that he treasure the quality of life in he neighborhood for Armstrong Southland be not constrain by its material condition instead the human spirit radiate out from the metal wall and garbage heap to offer something no legal neighborhood could freedom this place be very addictive he have say it be a simple life but nobody be restrict you nobody be control what you do once you have stay here you can not go back he mean back beyond that mountain of trash back in the legal city of legal building with legal lease and legal right once you have stay here he say you can stay for the rest of you life so he have hope and this be where this community start this be perhaps the most primitive shanty that you can find in Kibera little more than a stick and mud hut next to a garbage heap this be get ready for the monsoon in Bombay India this be home improvement put plastic tarp on you roof this be in Rio de Janeiro and it be get a bit well right we be see scavenge terra cotta tile and little piece of sign and plaster over the brick some color and this be Sulay Montakaya house in Sultanbelyi and it be get even well he be get a fence he scavenge a door he be get new tile on the roof and then you get Rocinha and you can see that it be get even well the building here be multi story they develop you can see on the far right one where it seem to just stack on top of each other room after room after room and what person do be they develop they home on one or two story and they sell they loggia or roof right and someone else build on top of they building and then that person sell the roof right and someone else build on top of they building all of this building be make out of reinforce concrete and brick and then you get Sultanbelyi in Turkey where it be even build to a high level of design the crud in the front be mattress stuffing and you see that all over Turkey People dry out or air out they mattress stuff on they roof but the green building on behind you can see that the top floor be not occupy so person be build with the possibility of expansion and it be build to a pretty high standard of design and then you finally get squatter home like this which be build on the suburban model hey that be a single family home in the squatter community that be also in Istanbul Turkey they be quite vital place this community this be the main drag of Rocinha the Estrada da Gavea and there be a bus route that run through it lot of person out on the street this community in this city be actually more vital than the illegal community they have more thing go on in they this be a typical pathway in Rocinha call a beco this be how you get around the community it be on very steep ground they be build on the hill inland from the beach in Rio and you can see that the house be just cantilever over the natural obstruction so that be just a rock in the hillside and this beco be normally very crowded and person hump furniture up they or refrigerator up they all sort of thing Beer be all carry in on you shoulder Beer be a very important thing in Brazil this be commerce in Kenya right along the train track so close to the train track that the merchant sometimes have to pull the merchandise out of the way this be a marketplace also in Kenya Toi Market lot of dealer in almost everything you want to buy that green thing in the foreground be mango this be a shopping street in Kibera and you can see that there be a soda dealer a health clinic two beauty salon a bar two grocery store and a church and more it be a typical downtown street it just happen to be self build this here on the right hand side be what be call a if you look at the fine print under the awn it be a hotel and what hotel mean in Kenya and India be a eat place so that be a restaurant person steal electrical power this be Rio People tap in and they have thief who be call grillo or cricket and they steal the electrical power and wire the neighborhood person burn trash to get rid of the garbage and they dig they own sewer channel talk about more plastic bag than plankton and sometimes they have natural trash disposal and when they have more money they cement they street and they put in sewer and good water pipe and stuff like that this be water go to Rio People run they water pipe all over the place and that little hut right there have a pump in it and that be what person do they steal electricity they install a pump and they tap into the water main and pump water up to they house so the question be how do you go from the mud hut village to the more developed city to the even highly developed Sultanbelyi I say there be two thing one be person need a guarantee they will not be evict that do not necessarily mean property right and I would disagree with Hernando de Soto on that question because property right create a lot of complication they be most often sell to person and person then wind up in debt and have to pay back the debt and sometimes have to sell they property in order to pay back the debt there be a whole variety of other reason why property right sometimes do not work in this case but they do need security of tenure and they need access to politics and that can mean two thing that can mean community organizing from below but it can also mean possibility from above and I say that because the system in Turkey be notable Turkey have two great law that protect squatter one be that it be call gecekondu in Turkish which mean build overnight and if you build you house overnight in Turkey you can not be evict without due process of law if they do not catch you during the night and the second aspect be that once you have 2 000 person in the community you can petition the government to be recognize as a legal sub municipality and when you be a legal sub municipality you suddenly have politics you be allow to have a elect government collect tax provide municipal service and that be exactly what they do so this be the civic leader of the future the woman in the center be Geeta Jiwa she live in one of that tent on the highway median in Mumbai that be Sureka Gundi she also live with she family on the tent along the same highway median they be very outspoken they be very active they can be community leader this woman be nine which mean grandma in Turkish and there be three old lady who live in that be she self build house behind she and they have live there for 30 or 40 year and they be the backbone of the community there this be Richard Muthama Peter and he be a itinerant street photographer in Kibera He make money take picture of the neighborhood and the person in the neighborhood and be a great resource in the community and finally my choice to run for mayor of Rio be Cezinio the fruit merchant with he two kid here and a more honest and give and care man I do not know the future of this community be in the person and in we ability to work with that person so I think the message I take from what I read from the book from what Armstrong say and from all this person be that this be neighborhood the issue be not urban poverty the issue be not the large over arch thing the issue be for we to recognize that this be neighborhood this be a legitimate form of urban development and that city have to engage this resident because they be build the city of the future thank you very much
