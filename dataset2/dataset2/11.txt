I can not help but this wish to think about when you be a little kid and all you friend ask you if a genie could give you one wish in the world what would it be and I always answer well I would want the wish to have the wisdom to know exactly what to wish for well then you would be screw because you would know what to wish for and you would use up you wish and now since we only have one wish unlike last year they have three wish I be not go to wish for that so let get to what I would like which be world peace and I know what you be think you be think the poor girl up there she think she be at a beauty pageant she be not she be at the TED Prize laughter but I really do think it make sense and I think that the first step to world peace be for person to meet each other I have meet a lot of different person over the year and I have film some of they from a dotcom executive in New York who want to take over the world to a military press officer in Qatar who would rather not take over the world if you have see the film control room that be send out you would understand a little bit why applause thank you wow some of you watch it that be great that be great so basically what I would like to talk about today be a way for person to travel to meet person in a different way than because you can not travel all over the world at the same time and a long time ago well about 40 year ago my mom have a exchange student and I be go to show you slide of the exchange student this be Donna this be Donna at the Statue of Liberty this be my mother and aunt teaching Donna how to ride a bike this be Donna eat ice cream and this be Donna teach my aunt how to do a Filipino dance I really think as the world be get small it become more and more important that we learn each other dance move that we meet each other we get to know each other we be able to figure out a way to cross border to understand each other to understand person hope and dream what make they laugh and cry and I know that we can not all do exchange program and I can not force everybody to travel I have already talk about that to Chris and Amy and they say that there be a problem with this you can not force person free will and I totally support that so we be not force person to travel but I would like to talk about another way to travel that do not require a ship or a airplane and just require a movie camera a projector and a screen and that be what I be go to talk to you about today I be ask that I speak a little bit about where I personally come from and Cameron I do not know how you manage to get out of that one but I think that build bridge be important to I because of where I come from I be the daughter of a American mother and a Egyptian Lebanese Syrian father so I be the living product of two culture come together no pun intend laughter and I have also be call as a Egyptian Lebanese Syrian American with a Persian name the Middle East Peace Crisis so maybe I start to take picture be some kind of way to bring both side of my family together a way to take the world with I a way to tell story visually it all kind of start that way but I think that I really realize the power of the image when I first go to the garbage collect village in Egypt when I be about 16 my mother take I there she be somebody who believe strongly in community service and decide that this be something that I need to do and so I go there and I meet some amazing woman there there be a center there where they be teach person how to read and write and get vaccination against the many disease you can get from sort through garbage and I begin teach there I teach English and I meet some incredible woman there I meet person that live seven person to a room barely can afford they evening meal yet live with this strength of spirit and sense of humor and just incredible quality I get draw into this community and I begin to take picture there I take picture of wedding and old family member thing that they want memory of about two year after I start take this picture the UN Conference on Population and Development ask I to show they at the conference so I be 18 I be very excited it be my first exhibit of photograph and they be all put up there and after about two day they all come down except for three person be very upset very angry that I be show this dirty side of Cairo and why do not I cut the dead donkey out of the frame and as I sit there I get very depressed I look at this big empty wall with three lonely photograph that be you know very pretty photograph and I be like I fail at this but I be look at this intense emotion and intense feeling that have come out of person just see this photograph here I be this 18 year old pipsqueak that nobody listen to and all of a sudden I put this photograph on the wall and there be argument and they have to be take down and I see the power of the image and it be incredible and I think the most important reaction that I see there be actually from person that would never have go to the garbage village themselves that would never have see that the human spirit could thrive in such difficult circumstance and I think it be at that point that I decide I want to use photography and film to somehow bridge gap to bridge culture bring person together cross border and so that be what really kind of start I off do a stint at MTV make a film call startup com and I have do a couple of music film but in 2003 when the war in Iraq be about to start it be a very surreal feeling for I because before the war start there be kind of this media war that be go on and I be watch television in New York and there seem to be just one point of view that be come across and the coverage go from the US State Department to embed troops and what be come across on the news be that there be go to be this clean war and precision bombing and the Iraqi would be greet the American as liberator and throw flower at they foot in the street of Baghdad and I know that there be a completely other story that be take place in the Middle East where my parent be I know that there be a completely other story be tell and I be think how be person suppose to communicate with each other when they be get completely different message and nobody know what the other be tell how be person suppose to have any kind of common understanding or know how to move together into the future so I know that I have to go there I just want to be in the center I have no plan I have no funding I do not even have a camera at the time I have somebody bring it there because I want to get access to Al Jazeera George Bush favorite channel and a place which I be very curious about because it be dislike by many government across the Arab world and also call the mouthpiece of Osama Bin Laden by some person in the US government so I be think this station that be hate by so many person have to be do something right I have get to go see what this be all about and I also want to go see Central Command which be 10 minute away and that way I could get access to how this news be be create on the Arab side reach the Arab world and on the US and western side reach the US and when I go there and sit there and meet this person that be in the center of it and sit with this character I meet some surprising very complex person and I would like to share with you a little bit of that experience of when you sit with somebody and you film they and you listen to they and you allow they more than a five second sound bite the amazing complexity of person emerge Samir Khader Business as usual Iraq and then Iraq and then Iraq but between we if I be offer a job with Fox I will take it to change the Arab nightmare into the American dream I still have that dream maybe I will never be able to do it but I have plan for my child when they finish high school I will send they to America to study there I will pay for they study and they will stay there Josh rush the night they show the pow and the dead soldier Al Jazeera show they it be powerful because America do not show that kind of image most of the news in America will not show really gory image and this show American soldier in uniform strew about a floor a cold tile floor and it be revolt it be absolutely revolting it make I sick at my stomach and then what hit I be the night before there have be some kind of bombing in Basra and Al Jazeera have show image of the person and they be equally if not more horrifying the image be and I remember have see it in the Al Jazeera office and think to myself wow that be gross that be bad and then go away and probably eat dinner or something and it do not affect I as much so the impact that have on I I realize that I just see person on the other side and that person in the Al Jazeera office must have feel the way I be feel that night and it upset I on a profound level that I be not as bother as much the night before it make I hate war but it do not make I believe that we be in a world that can live without war yet Jehane Noujaim I be overwhelm by the response of the film we do not know whether it would be able to get out there we have no funding for it we be incredibly lucky that it get pick up and when we show the film in both the United States and the Arab world we have such incredible reaction it be amazing to see how person be move by this film in the Arab world and it be not really by the film it be by the character I mean Josh rush be this incredibly complex person who be think about thing and when I show the film in the Middle East person want to meet Josh he kind of redefine we as a American population person start to ask I where be this guy now Al Jazeera offer he a job laughter and Samir on the other hand be also quite a interesting character for the Arab world to see because it bring out the complexity of this love hate relationship that the Arab world have with the West in the United States I be blow away by the motivation the positive motivation of the American person when they have see this film you know we be criticize abroad for believe we be the savior of the world in some way but the flip side of it be that actually when person do see what be happen abroad and person reaction to some of we policy abroad we feel this power that we need to we feel like we have to get the power to change thing and I see this with audience this woman come up to I after the screening and say you know I know this be crazy I see the bomb be load on the plane I see the military go out to war but you do not understand person anger towards we until you see the person in the hospital and the victim of the war and how do we get out of this bubble how do we understand what the other person be think now I do not know whether a film can change the world but I know the power of it I know that it start person think about how to change the world now I be not a philosopher so I feel like I should not go into great depth on this but let film speak for itself and take you to this other world because I believe that film have the ability to take you across border I would like you to just sit back and experience for a couple of minute be take into another world and this couple clip take you inside of two of the most difficult conflict that we be face with today the last 48 hour of two Palestinian suicide bomber paradise now Man as long as there be injustice someone must make a sacrifice woman that be no sacrifice that be revenge if you kill there be no difference between victim and occupier man if we have airplane we would not need martyr that be the difference woman the difference be that the Israeli military be still strong man then let we be equal in death we still have Paradise Woman there be no paradise it only exist in you head Man God forbid may God forgive you if you be not Abu Azzam daughter anyway I would rather have paradise in my head than live in this hell in this life we be dead anyway one only choose bitterness when the alternative be even bitter woman and what about we the one who remain will we win that way do not you see what you be do be destroy we and that you give Israel a alibi to carry on Man so with no alibi Israel will stop woman perhaps we have to turn it into a moral war man how if Israel have no moral woman be careful and the real person build peace through non violence Encounter Point Video Ambulance siren Tel Aviv Israel 1996 Tzvika my wife Ayelet call I and say there be a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv Ayelet what do you know about the casualty Tzvika off screen we be look for three girl we have no information Ayelet one be wind here but we have not hear from the other three Tzvika I say ok that be Bat Chen that be my daughter be you sure she be dead they say yes video police siren and shout over megaphone Bethlehem Occupied Palestinian Territories 2003 George on that day at around 6 30 I be drive with my wife and daughter to the supermarket when we get to here we see three Israeli military jeep park on the side of the road when we pass by the first jeep they open fire on we and my 12 year old daughter Christine be kill in the shooting bereave family Forum Jerusalem Tzvika I be the headmaster for all part George but there be a teacher that be in charge Tzvika yes I have assistant I deal with child all the time one year after they daughter death both Tzvika and George join the forum George at first I think it be a strange idea but after think logically about it I do not find any reason why not to meet they and let they know of we suffer Tzvika there be many thing that touch I we see that there be Palestinian who suffer a lot who lose child and still believe in the peace process and in reconciliation if we who lose what be most precious can talk to each other and look forward to a good future then everyone else must do so too from South Africa A Revolution through Music Amandla Music Video Man Song be something that we communicate with person who otherwise would not have understand where we be come from you could give they a long political speech they would still not understand but I tell you when you finish that song person will be like Damn I know where you nigga be come from I know where you guy be come from death unto apartheid narrator it be about the liberation struggle it be about that child who take to the street fight scream free Nelson Mandela it be about that union who put down they tool and demand freedom yes yes music and singing singing freedom applause Jehane Noujaim I think everybody have that feeling of sit in a theater in a dark room with other stranger watch a very powerful film and they feel that feeling of transformation and what I would like to talk about be how can we use that feeling to actually create a movement through film I have be listen to the talk in the conference and Robert Wright say yesterday that if we have a appreciation for another person humanity then they will have a appreciation for ours and that be what this be about it be about connect person through film get this independent voice out there now Josh rush actually end up leave the military and take a job with Al Jazeera laughter so he feel be that he be at Al Jazeera International because he feel like he can actually use media to bridge the gap between East and West and that be a amazing thing but I have be try to think about way to give power to this independent voice to give power to the filmmaker to give power to person who be try to use film for change and there be incredible organization that be out there do this already there be Witness that you hear from early there be just vision that be work with Palestinian and Israeli who be work together for peace and document that process and get interview out there and use this film to take to Congress to show that it be a powerful tool to show that this be a woman who be have she daughter kill in a attack and she believe that there be peaceful way to solve this there be work Films and there be current tv which be a incredible platform for person around the world to be able to put they applause yeah it be amazing I have watch it and I be blow away by it and its potential to bring voice from around the world independent voice from around the world and create a truly democratic global television so what can we do to create a platform for this organization to create some momentum to get everybody in the world involve in this movement I would like for we to imagine for a second imagine a day when you have everyone come together from around the world you have town and village and theater all from around the world get together and sit in the dark and share a communal experience of watch a film or a couple of film together watch a film which maybe highlight a character that be fight to live or just a character that defy stereotype make a joke sing a song Comedies documentary shorts this amazing power can be use to change person and to bond person together to cross border and have person feel like they be have a communal experience so if you imagine this day when all around the world you have theater and place where we project film if you imagine project from Times Square to Tahrir Square in Cairo the same film in Ramallah the same film in Jerusalem you know we have be talk to a friend of mine about use the side of the great pyramid and the Great Wall of China it be endless what you can imagine in term of where you can project film and where you can have this communal experience and I believe that this one day if we can create it this one day can create momentum for all of this independent voice there be not a organization which be connect the independent voice of the world to get out there and yet I be hear throughout this conference that the big challenge in we future be understand the other and have mutual respect for the other and cross border and if film can do that and if we can get all of this different location in the world to watch this film together this could be a incredible day so we have already make a partnership set up through somebody from the TED community John Camen who introduce I to Steven Apkon from the Jacob Burns Film Center and we start call up everybody and in the last week there have be so many person that have respond to we from as close as Palo Alto to Mongolia and to India there be person that want to be a part of this global day of film to be able to provide a platform for independent voice and independent film to get out there now we have think about a name for this day and I would like to share this with you now the most amazing part of this whole process have be share idea and wish and so I invite you to give brainstorm onto how do this day echo into the future how do we use technology to make this day echo into the future so that we can build community and have this community work together through the internet there be a time many many year ago when all of the continent be stick together and we call that landmass Pangea so what we have like to call this day of film be Pangea Cinema Day and if you just imagine that all of this person in this town would be watch then I think that we can actually really make a movement towards person understand each other good I know that it be very intangible touch person heart and soul but the only way that I know how to do it the only way that I know how to reach out to somebody heart and soul all across the world be by show they a film and I know that there be independent filmmaker and film out there that can really make this happen and that be my wish I guess I be suppose to give you my one sentence wish but we be way out of time Chris Anderson that be a incredible wish Pangea Cinema the day the world come together JN it be more tangible than world peace and it be certainly more immediate but it would be the day that the world come together through film the power of film can lady and gentleman Jehane Noujaim
