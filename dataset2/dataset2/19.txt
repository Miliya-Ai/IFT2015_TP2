Charles Van Doren who be later a senior editor of Britannica say the ideal encyclopedia should be radical it should stop be safe but if you know anything about the history of Britannica since 1962 it be anything but radical still a very completely safe stodgy type of encyclopedia Wikipedia on the other hand begin with a very radical idea and that be for all of we to imagine a world in which every single person on the planet be give free access to the sum of all human knowledge and that be what we be do so Wikipedia you just see the little demonstration of it it be a freely license encyclopedia it be write by thousand of volunteer all over the world in many many language it be write use wiki software which be the type of software he just demonstrate so anyone can quickly edit and save and it go live on the internet immediately and everything about Wikipedia be manage by virtually a all volunteer staff so when Yochai be talk about new method of organization he be exactly describe Wikipedia and what I be go to do today be tell you a little bit more about how it really work on the inside so Wikipedia own by the Wikimedia Foundation which I found a nonprofit organization and we goal the core aim of the Wikimedia Foundation be to get a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet and so if you think about what that mean it mean a lot more than just build a cool website we be really interested in all the issue of the digital divide poverty worldwide empower person everywhere to have the information that they need to make good decision and so we be go to have to do a lot of work that go beyond just the internet and so that be a big part of why we have choose the free licensing model because that empower local entrepreneur or anyone who want to they can take we content and do anything they like with it you can copy it redistribute it and you can do it commercially or non commercially so there be a lot of opportunity that be go to arise around Wikipedia all over the world we be fund by donation from the public and one of the more interesting thing about that be how little money it actually take to run Wikipedia so Yochai show you the graph of what the cost of a printing press be and I be go to tell you what the cost of Wikipedia be but first I will show you how big it be so we have get over 600 000 article in English we have get two million total article across many many different language the big language be German Japanese French all the western European language be quite big but only around one third of all of we traffic to we web cluster to the English Wikipedia which be surprising to a lot of person a lot of person think in a very English centric way on the internet but for we we be truly global we be in many many language how popular we have get to be we be a top 50 website and we be more popular than the New York Times so this be where we get to Yochai discussion this show the growth of Wikipedia we be the blue line there and this be the New York Times over there and what be interesting about this be the New York Times website be a huge enormous corporate operation with I have no idea how many hundred of employee we have exactly one employee and that employee be we lead software developer and he be only be we employee since January 2005 all the other growth before that so the server be manage by a ragtag band of volunteer all the editing be do by volunteer and the way that we be organize be not like any traditional organization you can imagine person be always ask well who be in charge of this or who do that and the answer be anybody who want to pitch in it be a very unusual and chaotic thing we have get over 90 server now in three location this be manage by volunteer system administrator who be online I can go online any time of the day or night and see eight to 10 person wait for I to ask a question or something anything about the server you could never afford to do this in a company you could never afford to have a standby crew of person 24 hour a day and do what we be do at Wikipedia so we be do around 1 4 billion page view monthly so it be really get to be a huge thing and everything be manage by the volunteer and the total monthly cost for we bandwidth be about 5 000 dollar and that be essentially we main cost we could actually do without the employee we hire Brian because he be work part time for two year and full time at Wikipedia so we actually hire he so he could get a life and go to the movie sometimes so the big question when you have get this really chaotic organization be why be not it all rubbish why be the website as good as it be first of all how good be it well it be pretty good it be not perfect but it be much good than you would expect give we completely chaotic model so when you see he make a ridiculous edit to the page about I you think oh this be obviously just go to degenerate into rubbish but when we have see quality test and there have not be enough of this yet and I be really encourage person to do more compare Wikipedia to traditional thing we win hand down so a German magazine compare German Wikipedia which be much much small than English to Microsoft Encarta and to Brockhaus multimedial and we win across the board they hire expert to come and look at article and compare the quality and we be very pleased with that result so a lot of person have hear about the Wikipedia Bush Kerry controversy the media have cover this somewhat extensively it start out with a article in Red Herring the reporter call I up and they I mean I have to say they spell my name right but they really want to say the Bush Kerry election be so contentious it be tear apart the Wikipedia community and so they quote I as say they be the most contentious in the history of Wikipedia what I actually say be they be not contentious at all so it be a slight misquote laughter the article be edit quite heavily and it be true that we do have to lock the article on a couple of occasion Time magazine recently report that Extreme action sometimes have to be take and Wales lock the entry on Kerry and Bush for most of 2004 this come after I tell the reporter that we have to lock it for occasionally a little bit here and there so the truth in general be that the kind of controversy that you would probably think we have within the Wikipedia community be not really controversy at all article on controversial topic be edit a lot but they do not cause much controversy within the community and the reason for this be that most person understand the need for neutrality the real struggle be not between the right and the leave that be where most person assume but it be between the party of the thoughtful and the party of the jerk and no side of the political spectrum have a monopoly on either of that quality the actual truth about the specific Bush Kerry incident be that the Bush Kerry article be lock less than one percent of the time in 2004 and it be not because they be contentious it be just because there be routine vandalism which happen sometimes even on stage laughter sometimes even reporter have report to I that they vandalize Wikipedia and be amazed that it be fix so quickly and I say you know I always say please do not do that that be not a good thing so how do we do this how do we manage the quality control how do it work so there be a few element mostly social policy and some element of the software so the big and the most important thing be we neutral point of view policy this be something that I set down from the very beginning as a core principle of the community that be completely not debatable it be a social concept of cooperation so we do not talk a lot about truth and objectivity the reason for this be if we say we be only go to write the truth about some topic that do not do we a damn bit of good of figure out what to write because I do not agree with you about what be the truth but we have this jargon term of neutrality which have its own long history within the community which basically say any time there be a controversial issue Wikipedia itself should not take a stand on the issue we should merely report on what reputable party have say about it so this neutrality policy be really important for we because it empower a community that be very diverse to come together and actually get some work do so we have very diverse contributor in term of political religious cultural background by have this firm neutrality policy which be non negotiable from the beginning we ensure that person can work together and that the entry do not become simply a war back and forth between the left and the right if you engage in that type of behavior you will be ask to leave the community so real time peer review every single change on the site go to the recent change page so as soon as he make he change it go to the recent change page that recent change page be also feed into a irc channel which be a internet chat channel that person be monitor with various software tool and person can get RSS feed they can get email notification of change and then user can set up they own personal watch list so my page be on quite a few volunteer watch list because it be sometimes vandalize and therefore what happen be someone will notice the change very quickly and then they will just simply revert the change there be a new page feed for example so you can go to a certain page of Wikipedia and see every new page as it be create this be really important because a lot of new page be just garbage that have to be delete you know ASDFASDF but also that be some of the most interesting and fun thing some of the new article person will start a article on some interesting topic other person will find that intriguing and jump in and help and make it much well so we do have edit by anonymous user which be one of the most controversial and intriguing thing about Wikipedia so Chris be able to do he change he do not have to log in or anything he just go on the website and make a change but it turn out that only about 18 percent of all the edit to the website be do by anonymous user and that be a really important thing to understand the vast majority of the edit that go on on the website be from a very close knit community of maybe 600 to 1 000 person who be in constant communication and we have over 40 irc channel 40 mailing list all this person know each other they communicate we have off line meeting this be the person who be do the bulk of the site and they be in a sense semi professional at what they be do the standard we set for ourselves be equal to or high than professional standard of quality we do not always meet that standard but that be what we be strive for and so that tight community be who really care for the site and this be some of the smart person I have ever meet it be my job to say that but it be actually true the type of person who be draw to write a encyclopedia for fun tend to be pretty smart person the tool and the software there be lot of tool that allow we allow we mean the community to self monitor and to monitor all the work this be a example of a page history on flat Earth and you can see some change that be make what be nice about this page be you can immediately take a look at this and see ok I understand now when somebody go and look at they see that someone a anonymous ip number make a edit to my page that sound suspicious who be this person somebody look at it they can immediately see highlight in red all of the change that take place to see ok well this word have change thing like this so that be one tool that we can use to very quickly monitor the history of a page another thing that we do within the community be we leave everything very open end most of the social rule and the method of work be leave completely open end in the software all of that stuff be just on Wiki page and so there be nothing in the software that enforce the rule the example I have get up here be the vote for deletion page so I mention early person type asdfasdf it need to be delete case like that the administrator just delete it there be no reason to have a big argument about it but you can imagine there be a lot of other area where the question be be this notable enough to go in a encyclopedia be the information verifiable be it a hoax be it true be it what so we need a social method for figure out the answer to this and so the method that arise organically within the community be the vote for deletion page and in the particular example we have here it be a film twist issue and the first person say now this be supposedly a film it fail the Google test miserably the Google test be you look in Google and see if it be there because if something be not even in Google it probably do not exist at all it be not a perfect rule but it be a nice starting point for quick research so somebody say delete it please delete it it be not notable and then somebody say wait I find it I find it in a book Film threat Video Guide the 20 Underground Films you must see so the next person say clean it up somebody say I have find it on IMDB keep keep keep and what be interesting about this be that the software be this vote be just text type into a page this be not really a vote so much as it be a dialogue now it be true that at the end of the day a administrator can go through here and take a look at this and say ok 18 delete two keep we will delete it but in other case this could be 18 delete and two keep and we would keep it because if that last two keep say wait a minute nobody else see this but I find it in a book and I find a link to a page that describe it and I be go to clean it up tomorrow so please do not delete it then it would survive and it also matter who the person be who be vote like I say it be a tight knit community down here at the bottom keep real movie rickk rickk be a very famous Wikipedian who do a enormous amount of work with vandalism hoax and vote for deletion he voice carry a lot of weight within the community because he know what he be do so how be all this govern person really want to know about administrator thing like that so the Wikipedia governance model the governance of the community be a very confusing but workable mix of consensus meaning we try not to vote on the content of article because the majority view be not necessarily neutral some amount of democracy all of the administrator this be the person who have the ability to delete page that do not mean that they have the right to delete page they still have to follow all the rule but they be elect by the community sometimes person random troll on the internet like to accuse I of handpick the administrator to bias the content of the encyclopedia I always laugh at this because I have no idea how they be elect actually there be a certain amount of aristocracy you get a hint of that when I mention like RickK voice would carry a lot more weight than someone we do not know I give this talk sometimes with Angela who be just re elect to the board from the community to the Board of the Foundation with more than twice the vote of the person who do not make it and I always embarrass she because I say well Angela for example could get away with do absolutely anything within Wikipedia because she be so admired and so powerful but the irony be of course that Angela can do this because she be the one person who you know would never ever break any rule of Wikipedia and I also like to say she be the only person who actually know all the rule of Wikipedia so and then there be monarchy and that be my role on the community so laughter I be describe this in Berlin once and the next day in the newspaper the headline say I be the queen of England laughter and that be not exactly what I say but laughter the point be my role in the community within the free software world there be be a long standing tradition of the benevolent dictator model so if you look at most of the major free software project they have one single person in charge who everyone agree be the benevolent dictator well I do not like the term benevolent dictator and I do not think that it be my job or my role in the world of idea to be the dictator of the future of all human knowledge compile by the world it just be not appropriate but there be a need still for a certain amount of monarchy a certain amount of sometimes we have to make a decision and we do not want to get bog down too heavily in formal decision make process so as a example of how this can be important we recently have a situation where a neo Nazi website discover Wikipedia and they say oh well this be horrible this Jewish conspiracy of a website and we be go to get certain article delete that we do not like and we see they have a voting process so we be go to send we have 40 000 member and we be go to send they over and they be all go to vote and get this page delete well they manage to get 18 person to show up that be neo Nazi math for you they always think they have get 40 000 member when they have get 18 but they manage to get 18 person to come and vote in a fairly absurd way to delete a perfectly valid article of course the vote end up be about 85 to 18 so there be no real danger to we democratic process on the other hand person say but what be we go to do I mean this could happen what if some group get really seriously organize and come in and want to vote then I say well fuck it we will just change the rule that be my job in the community to say we will not allow we openness and freedom to undermine the quality of the content and so as long as person trust I in my role then that be a valid place for I of course because of the free licensing if I do a bad job the volunteer be more than happy to take and leave I can not tell anyone what to do so the final point here be that to understand how Wikipedia work it be important to understand that we wiki model be the way we work but we be not fanatical web anarchist in fact we be very flexible about the social methodology because ultimately the passion of the community be for the quality of the work not necessarily for the process that we use to generate it thank you applause Ben Saunders yeah hi Ben Saunders Jimmy you mention impartiality be a key to Wikipedia success it strike I that much of the textbook that be use to educate we child be inherently biased have you find Wikipedia be use by teacher and how do you see Wikipedia change education Jimmy Wales yeah so a lot of teacher be begin to use Wikipedia there be a media storyline about Wikipedia which I think be false it build on the storyline of blogger versus newspaper and the storyline be there be this crazy thing Wikipedia but academic hate it and teacher hate it and that turn out to not be true the last time I get a email from a journalist say why do academic hate Wikipedia I send it from my Harvard email address because I be recently appoint a fellow there and I say well they do not all hate it laughter but I think there be go to be huge impact and we actually have a project that I be personally really excited about which be the Wikibooks project which be a effort to create textbook in all the language and that be a much big project it be go to take 20 year or so to come to fruition but part of that be to fulfill we mission of give a encyclopedia to every single person on the planet we do not mean we be go to spam they with AOL style cd we mean we be go to give they a tool that they can use and for a lot of person in the world if I give you a encyclopedia that be write at a university level it do not do you any good without a whole host of literacy material to build you up to the point where you can actually use it the Wikibooks project be a effort to do that and I think that we be go to see it may not even come from we there be all kind of innovation go on but freely license textbook be the next big thing in education
