I be go to try to give you a view of the world as I see it the problem and the opportunity that we face and then ask the question if we should be optimistic or pessimistic and then I will let you in on a secret which be why I be a incurable optimist let I start off show you a Al Gore movie that you may have see before now you have all see Inconvenient Truth this be a little more inconvenient video man extremely dangerous question because with we present knowledge we have no idea what would happen even now man may be unwittingly change the world climate through the waste product of he civilization due to we release through factory and automobile every year of more than six billion ton of carbon dioxide which help air absorb heat from the sun we atmosphere seem to be get warm this be bad well it be be calculate a few degree rise in the earth temperature would melt the polar ice cap and if this happen a inland sea would fill a good portion of the Mississippi Valley tourist in glass bottom boat would be view the drown tower of Miami through 150 foot of tropical water for in weather we be not only deal with force of a far great variety than even the atomic physicist encounter but with life itself Larry Brilliant should we feel good or should we feel bad that 50 year of foreknowledge accomplish so little well it depend really on what you goal be and I think as my goal I always go back to Gandhi talisman when Mahatma Gandhi be ask how do you know if the next act that you be about to do be the right one or the wrong one he say consider the face of the poor most vulnerable human being that you ever chance upon and ask yourself if the act that you contemplate will be of benefit to that person and if it will be it be the right thing to do and if not rethink it for that of we in this room it be not just the poor and the most vulnerable individual it be the community it be the culture it be the world itself and the trend for that who be at the periphery of we society who be the poor and the most vulnerable the trend give rise to a great case for pessimism but there be also a wonderful case for optimism let review they both First of all the megatrend there be two degree or three degree of climate change bake into the system it will cause rise sea it will cause saline deposit into well and into land it will disproportionately harm the poor and the most vulnerable as will the increase rise of population even though we have dodge Paul Ehrlich population bomb and we will not see 20 billion person in this decade as he have forecast we eat as if we be 20 billion and we consume so much that again a rise of 6 5 billion to 9 5 billion in we grandchild lifetime will disproportionately hurt the poor and the most vulnerable that be why they migrate to city that be why in June of this year we pass as a species 51 percent of we live in city and bustee and slum and shantytown the rural area be no long produce as much food as they do the green revolution never reach Africa and with desertification sandstorm the Gobi Desert the Ogaden we be find increase difficulty of a hectare to produce as many calorie as it do even 15 year ago so human be turn more towards animal consumption in Africa last year African eat 600 million wild animal and consume two billion kilogram of bush meat and every kilogram of bush meat contain hundred of thousand of novel virus that have never be chart the genomic sequence of which we do not know they fitness for create pandemic we be unaware of but we be ripe for zoonotic bear emerge communicable disease increasingly I would say explosive growth of technology most of we be the beneficiary of that growth but it have a dark side in bioweapon and in technology that put we on a collision course to magnify any anger hatred or feeling of marginalization and in fact with increase globalization for which there be big winner and even big loser today the world be more diverse and unfair than perhaps it have ever be in history one percent of we own 40 percent of all the goods and service what will happen if the billion person today who live on less than one dollar a day rise to three billion in the next 30 year the one percent will own even more than 40 percent of all the world goods and service not because they have grow rich but because the rest of the world have grow increasingly poor last week Bill Clinton at the TED Awards say this situation be unprecedented unequal unfair and unstable so there be lot of reason for pessimism Darfur be at its origin a resource war last year there be 85 000 riot in China 230 a day that require police or military intervention most of they be about resource we be face a unprecedented number scale of disaster some be weather relate human right relate epidemic and the newly emerge disease may make h5n1 and bird flu a quaint forerunner of thing to come it be a destabilized world and unlike destabilized world in the past it will be broadcast to you on YouTube you will see it on digital television and on you cell phone what will that lead to for some it will lead to anger religious and sectarian violence and terrorism for other withdrawal nihilism materialism for we where do it take we as social activist and entrepreneur as we look at this trend do we become despondent or will we become energized let look at one case the case of Bangladesh First even if carbon dioxide emission stop today global warming would continue and even with global warming if you can see this blue line the dot line show that even if emission of greenhouse gas stop today the next decade will see rise sea level a minimum of 20 to 30 inch of increase in sea level be the good case that we can hope for and it could be 10 time that what will that do to Bangladesh let take a look so here be Bangladesh 70 percent of Bangladesh be at less than five foot above sea level let go up and take a look at the Himalayas and we will watch as global warming make they melt more water come down the deforest area here in the Tarai will be unable to absorb the effluent because tree be like straw that suck up the extra seasonal water now we be look down south through the Kali Gandaki many of you I think have probably trek here and we be go to cruise down and take a look at Bangladesh and see what the impact will be of twin increase in water come from the north and in the sea rise from the south look at the five major river that feed Bangladesh and now let look from the south look up and let see this in relief a minimum of 20 to 40 inch of increase in sea couple with increase flow from the Himalayas and take a look at this as many as 100 million refugee from Bangladesh could be expect to migrate into India and into China this be the difficulty that one country face but if you look at the globe all around the earth wherever there be low lie area populate area near the water you will find increase in sea level that will challenge we way of life sub Saharan Africa and even we own San Francisco Bay Area we be all in this together this be not something that happen far away to person that we do not know global warming be something that happen to all of we all at once As be this newly emerge communicable disease name that you have not hear 20 year ago ebola lhasa fever monkey pox with the erosion of the green belt separate animal from human we live in each other viral environment do you remember 20 year ago no one have ever hear of West Nile fever and then we watch as one case arrive on the East Coast of the United States and it march every year westwardly do you remember no one have hear of ebola until we hear of hundred of person die in Central Africa from it it be just the beginning unfortunately there have be 30 novel emerge communicable disease that begin in animal that have jump species in the last 30 year it be more than enough reason for pessimism but now let look at the case for optimism laughter Enough of the bad news human being have always rise to the challenge you just need to look at the list of Nobel laureate to remind ourselves we have be here before paralyze by fear paralyze into inaction when some probably one of you in this room jump into the breach and create a organization like Physicians for Social responsibility which fight against the nuclear threat Medicins Sans Frontieres that renew we commitment to disaster relief Mohamed ElBaradei and the tremendous hope and optimism that he bring all of we and we own Muhammad Yunus we have see the eradication of smallpox we may see the eradication of polio this year last year there be only 2 000 case in the world we may see the eradication of guinea worm next year there be only 35 000 case leave in the world 20 year ago there be three and a half million and we have see a new disease not like the 30 novel emerge communicable disease this disease be call sudden wealth syndrome laughter it be a amazing phenomenon all throughout the technology world we be see young person bite by this disease of sudden wealth syndrome but they be use they wealth in a way that they forefather never do they be not wait until they die to create foundation they be actively guide they money they resource they heart they commitment to make the world a good place certainly nothing can give you more optimism than that more reason to be optimistic in the 60 and I be a creature of the 60 there be a movement we all feel that we be part of it that a good world be right around the corner that we be watch the birth of a world free of hatred and violence and prejudice today there be another kind of movement it be a movement to save the earth it be just begin five week ago a group of activist from the business community gather together to stop a Texas utility from build nine coal fire electrical plant that would have contribute to destroy the environment six month ago a group of business activist gather together to join with the Republican governor in California to pass AB 32 the most far reach legislation in environmental history Al Gore make presentation in the House and the Senate as a expert witness can you imagine laughter we be see a entente cordiale between science and religion that five year ago I would not have believe as the Evangelical community have understand the desperate situation of global warming and now 4 000 church have join the environmental movement it be something to be greatly optimistic about the European 20 20 20 plan be a amazing breakthrough something that should make all of we feel that hope be on the horizon and on April 14th there will be step up day where there will be a thousand individual mobilize social activist movement in the United States on protest against legislation push for legislation to stop global warming and on July 7th around the world I learn only yesterday there will be global live Earth concert and you can feel this optimistic move to save the earth in the air now that do not mean that person understand that global warming hurt the poor and the weak the most that mean that person be begin the first step which be act out of they own self interest but I be see in the major funder in CARE Rockefeller Rockefeller Brothers Fund Hewlett mercy Corps you guy Google so many other organization a beginning of understanding that we need to work not just on primary prevention of global warming but on the secondary prevention of the consequence of global warming on the poor and the most vulnerable but for I I have another reason to be a incurable optimist and you have hear so many inspiring story here and I hear so many last night that I think I would share a little bit of mine my background be not exactly conventional medical training and I live in a himalayan monastery and I study with a very wise teacher who kick I out of the monastery one day and tell I that it be my destiny it feel like Yoda it be you destiny to go to work for who and to help eradicate smallpox at a time when there be no smallpox program it should make you optimistic that smallpox no long exist because it be the bad disease in history in the last century that be the one that be seven year ago half a billion person die from smallpox more than all the war in history more than any other infectious disease in the history of the world in the summer of love in 1967 two million person child die of smallpox it be not ancient history when you read the biblical plague of boil that be smallpox Pharaoh Ramses the Fifth whose picture be here die of smallpox to eradicate smallpox we have to gather the large United Nations army in history we visit every house in India search for smallpox 120 million house once every month for nearly two year in a cruel reversal after we have almost conquer smallpox and this be what you must learn as a social entrepreneur the realm of the final inch when we have almost eradicate smallpox it come back again because the company town of Tatanagar draw laborer who could come there and get employment and they catch smallpox in the one remain place that have smallpox and they go home to die and when they do they take smallpox to 10 other country and reignite the epidemic and we have to start all over again but in the end we succeed and the last case of smallpox this little girl Rahima Banu Barisal in Bangladesh when she cough or breathe and the last virus of smallpox leave she lung and fall on the dirt and the sun kill that last virus thus end a chain of transmission of history great horror how can that not make you optimistic a disease which kill hundred of thousand in India and blind half of all of that who be make blind in India end and most importantly for we here in this room a bond be create doctor health worker from 30 different country of every race every religion every color work together fight alongside each other fight against a common enemy do not fight against each other how can that not make you feel optimistic for the future thank you very much applause
