hi I be go to ask you to raise you arm and wave back just the way I be kind of a royal wave you can mimic what you can see you can program the hundred of muscle in you arm soon you will be able to look inside you brain and program control the hundred of brain area that you see there I be go to tell you about that technology person have want to look inside the human mind the human brain for thousand of year well come out of the research lab just now for we generation be the possibility to do that person envision this as be very difficult you have to take a spaceship shrink it down inject it into the bloodstream it be terribly dangerous laughter you could be attack by white blood cell in the artery but now we have a real technology to do this we be go to fly into my colleague Peter brain we be go to do it non invasively use mri we do not have to inject anything we do not need radiation we will be able to fly into the anatomy of Peter brain literally fly into he body but more importantly we can look into he mind when Peter move he arm that yellow spot you see there be the interface to the functioning of Peter mind take place now you have see before that with electrode you can control robotic arm that brain imaging and scanner can show you the inside of brain what be new be that that process have typically take day or month of analysis we have collapse that through technology to millisecond and that allow we to let Peter to look at he brain in real time as he be inside the scanner he can look at this 65 000 point of activation per second if he can see this pattern in he own brain he can learn how to control it there have be three way to try to impact the brain the therapist couch pill and the knife this be a fourth alternative that you be soon go to have we all know that as we form thought they form deep channel in we mind and in we brain chronic pain be a example if you burn yourself you pull you hand away but if you be still in pain in six month or six year time it be because this circuit be produce pain that be no longer help you if we can look at the activation in the brain that be produce the pain we can form 3d model and watch in real time the brain process information and then we can select the area that produce the pain so put you arm back up and flex you bicep now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside you brain and select brain area to do that same thing what you be see here be we have select the pathway in the brain of a chronic pain patient this may shock you but we be literally read this person brain in real time they be watch they own brain activation and they be control the pathway that produce they pain they be learn to flex this system that release they own endogenous opiate as they do it in the upper left be a display that be yoke to they brain activation of they own pain be control when they control they brain they can control they pain this be a investigational technology but in clinical trial we be see a 44 to 64 percent decrease in chronic pain patient this be not the Matrix you can only do this to yourself you take control I have see inside my brain you will too soon when you do what do you want to control you will be able to look at all the aspect that make you yourself all you experience this be some of the area we be work on today that I do not have time to go into in detail but I want to leave with you the big question we be the first generation that be go to be able to enter into use this technology the human mind and brain where will we take it
