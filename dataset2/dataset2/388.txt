four year ago on the TED stage I announce a company I be work with at the time call Odeo and because of that announcement we get a big article in the New York Times which lead to more press which lead to more attention and I decide to become ceo of that company whereas I be just a adviser and raise a round of venture capital and ramp up hire one of the guy I hire be a engineer name Jack Dorsey and a year later when we be try to decide which way to go with Odeo Jack present a idea he have be tinker around with for a number of year that be base around send simple status update to friend we be also play with sms at the time at Odeo so we kind of put two and two together and in early 2006 we launch Twitter as a side project at Odeo now it be hard to justify do a side project at a startup where focus be so critical but I have actually launch Blogger as a side project to my previous company think it be just a little thing we have do on the side and it end up take over not only the company but my life for the next five or six year so I learn to follow hunch even though you can not necessarily justify they or know where they be go to go and that be kind of what be happen with Twitter time after time so for that of you unfamiliar Twitter be base around a very simple seemingly trivial concept you say what you be do in 140 character or less and person who be interested in you get that update if they be really interested they get the update as a text message on they cell phone so for instance I may Twitter right now that I be give a talk at TED and in my case when I hit send up to 60 000 person will receive that message in a matter of second now the fundamental idea be that Twitter let person share moment of they life whenever they want be they momentous occasion or mundane one it be by share this moment as they be happen that let person feel more connected and in touch despite distance and in real time this be the primary use we see of Twitter from the beginning and what get we excited what we do not anticipate be the many many other use that would evolve from this very simple system one of the thing we realize be how important Twitter could be during real time event when the wildfire break out in San Diego in October of 2007 person turn to Twitter to report what be happen and to find information from neighbor about what be happen around they but it be not just individual the l a Times actually turn to Twitter to dispense information as well and put a Twitter feed on the front page and the l a Fire Department and Red Cross use it to dispense news and update as well at this event dozen of person here be twitter and thousand of person around the world be follow along because they want to know what it feel like to be here and what be happen among the other interesting thing that have crop upare many thing from business from marketing and communication and predictable thing to a insanely popular Korean barbecue taco truck that drive around L A and Twitters where it stop cause a line to form around the block politician have recently begin twitter in fact there be 47 member of Congress who currently have Twitter account and they be tweet in some case from behind close door session with the President in this case this guy be not like what he be hear the President himself be we most popular Twitter user although he tweet have drop off as of late while Senator McCain have pick up as have this guy Twitter be originally design as a broadcast medium you send one message and it go out to everybody and you receive the message you be interested in one of the many way that user shape the evolution of Twitter be by invent a way to reply to a specific person or a specific message so this syntax the username that Shaquille O Neal use here to reply to one of he fan be completely invent by user and we do not build it into the system until it already become popular and then we make it easy this be one of the many way that user have shape the system another be via the api we build a application programming interface which basically mean that programmer can write software that interact with Twitter we currently know about over 2 000 piece of software that can send Twitter update interface for Mac Windows you iPhone you blackberry as well as thing like a device that let a unborn baby Twitter when it kick or a plant Twitter when it need water probably the most important third party development come from a little company in Virginia call Summize Summize build a Twitter search engine and they tap into the fact that if you have million of person around the world talk about what they be do and what be around they you have a incredible resource to find out about any topic or event while it be go on this really change how we perceive Twitter for instance here be what person be say about TED this be another way that we mind be shift and Twitter be not what we think it be we like this so much we actually buy the company and be fold it into the main product this not only let you view twitter in different way but it introduce new use case as well one of my favorite be what happen a few month ago when there be a gas shortage in Atlanta some user figure out that they would Twitter when they find gas where it be and how much it cost and then append the keyword atlga which let other person search for that and find gas themselves and this trend of person use this communication network to help each other out go far beyond the original idea of just keep up with family and friend it be happen more and more lately whether it be raise money for homeless person or to dig well in Africa or for a family in crisis person have raise ten of thousand of dollar over Twitter in a matter of day on several occasion it seem like when you give person easy way to share information more good thing happen I have no idea what will happen next with Twitter I have learn to follow the hunch but never assume where it will go thanks applause Chris Anderson we be not quite do yet so look if we could have this screen live this be actually the most terrifying thing that any speaker can do after they have be to a event it be totally intimidating so this would be the Twitter search screen so we be go to just type a couple of random word into Twitter for example Evan Williams Evan Williams give person more good way to share information and follow you hunch at TED currently listen to Evan Williams currently listen to Evan Williams Evan Williams oh Evan Williams be just die on stage here at TED bad talk ever laughter Evan Williams Nice thanks CA just kid but literally in the eight minute he be talk there be about fifty tweet that already come on the talk so he will see every aspect of the reaction the fact that Barack Obama be the big Twitterer the fact that it come out of TED I do not think there be any other way of get instant feedback that way you have build something very fascinating and it look like its good time be still ahead of it so thank you very much Evan EW thank you CA that be very interesting
