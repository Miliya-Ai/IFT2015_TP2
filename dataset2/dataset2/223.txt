how many of you have see the Alfred Hitchcock film the bird any of you get really freak out by that you might want to leave now laughter so this be a vend machine for crow over the past few day many of you have be ask how do you come to this how do you get start do this it start as with many great idea or many idea you can not get rid of anyway at a cocktail party about 10 year ago I be at a cocktail party with a friend of mine we be sit there and he be complain about the crow that be all over he yard and make a big mess and he be tell I we ought to eradicate this thing kill they because they be make a mess I say that be stupid maybe we should just train they to do something useful and he say that be impossible and I be sure I be in good company in find that tremendously annoying when someone tell you it be impossible so I spend the next 10 year read about crow in my spare time laughter and after 10 year of this my wife say you have get to do this thing you have be talk about and build the vend machine so I do but part of the reason I find this interesting be I start notice that we be very aware of all the species that be go extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion and no one seem to be pay attention to all the species that be actually live they be survive and I be talk specifically about synanthropic species which have adapt specifically for human ecology species like rat and cockroach and crow and as I start look at they I be find that they have hyper adapt they would become extremely adept at live with we and in return we just try to kill they all the time laughter and in do so we be breed they for parasitism we be give they all sort of reason to adapt new way so for example rat be incredibly responsive breeder and cockroach as anyone who be try to get rid of they know have become really immune to the poison that we be use so I think let build something that be mutually beneficial something that we can both benefit from and find some way to make a new relationship with this species so I build the vend machine but the story of the vend machine be a little more interesting if you know more about crow it turn out crow be not just survive with human being they be actually thrive they be find everywhere on the planet except for the Arctic and the southern tip of South America and in all that area they be only rarely find breed more than five kilometer away from human being so we may not think about they but they be always around and not surprisingly give the human population growth more than half of the human population be live in city now and out of that nine tenth of the human growth population be occur in city we be see a population boom with crow so bird count be indicate that we might be see up to exponential growth in they number so that be no great surprise but what be really interesting to I be to find out that the bird be adapt in a pretty unusual way and I will give you a example of that this be Betty she be a new Caledonian crow and this crow use stick in the wild to get insect and whatnot out of piece of wood here she be try to get a piece of meat out of a tube but the researcher have a problem they mess up and leave just a stick of wire in there and she have not have the opportunity to do this before you see it be not work very well so she adapt now this be completely unprompted she have never see this do before no one teach she to bend this into a hook or have show she how it could happen but she do it all on she own so keep in mind she be never see this do laughter right laughter yeah all right applause so that be the part where the researcher freak out laughter it turn out we have be find more and more that crow be really intelligent they brain be in the same proportion as chimpanzee brain be there be all kind of anecdote for the different kind of intelligence they have for example in Sweden crow will wait for fisherman to drop line through hole in the ice and when the fisherman move off the crow fly down reel up the line and eat the fish or the bait it be pretty annoying for the fisherman on a entirely different tack at University of Washington a few year ago they be do a experiment where they capture some crow on campus some student go out net some crow bring they in weigh and measure they and let they back out again and they be entertain to discover that for the rest of the week whenever this particular student walk around campus this crow would caw at they and run around and make they life kind of miserable laughter they be significantly less entertained when this go on for the next week and the next month and after summer break until they finally graduate and leave campus and glad to get away I be sure come back sometime later and find the crow still remember they laughter so the moral be do not piss off crow so now student at the University of Washington that be study this crow do so with a giant wig and a big mask laughter it be fairly interesting laughter so we know this crow be really smart but the more I dig into this the more I find that they actually have a even more significant adaptation video crow have become highly skilled at make a living in this new urban environment in this Japanese city they have devise a way of eat a food that normally they can not manage drop it among the traffic the problem now be collect the bit without get run over wait for the light to stop the traffic then collect you crack nut in safety laughter applause Joshua Klein yeah pretty interesting what be significant about this be not that crow be use car to crack nuts in fact that old hat for crow this happen about 10 year ago in a place call Sendai City at a driving school in the suburb of Tokyo and since that time all the crow in the neighborhood be pick up this behavior now every crow within five kilometer be stand by a sidewalk wait to collect its lunch so they be learn from each other and research bear this out parent seem to be teach they young they learn from they peer they learn from they enemy if I have a little extra time I will tell you about a case of crow infidelity that illustrate that nicely the point be they have develop cultural adaptation and as we hear yesterday that be the Pandora box that be get human being in trouble and we be start to see it with they they be able to very quickly and very flexibly adapt to new challenge and new resource in they environment which be really useful if you live in a city so we know that there be lot of crow we find out they be really smart and they can teach each other when all this become clear I realize the only obvious thing to do be build a vend machine so that be what we do this be a vend machine for crow and it use skinnerian training to shape they behavior over four stage it be pretty simple basically what happen be that we put this out in a field or someplace where there be lot of crow we put coin and peanut all around the base of the machine crow eventually come by eat the peanut and get use to the machine be there eventually they eat all the peanut then they see peanut here on the feeder tray and hop up and help themselves then they leave the machine spit up more coin and peanut and life be dandy if you be a crow you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut so when they get really use to that we move on to the crow come back now they be use to the sound of the machine they keep come back and dig out peanut from the pile of coin that be there when they get really happy about this we stymie they we move to the third stage where we only give they a coin now like most of we who have get use to a good thing this really piss they off so they do what they do in nature when they be look for something sweep thing out of the way with they beak they do that here and that knock the coin down the slot when that happen they get a peanut this go on for some time the crow learn that all they have to do be show up wait for the coin to come out put it in the slot then get they peanut when they be good and comfortable with that we move to the final stage where they show up and nothing happen this be where we see the difference between crow and other animal Squirrels for example would show up look for the peanut go away come back look for the peanut go away they do this maybe half a dozen time before they get bored and then they go off and play in traffic crow on the other hand show up and they try and figure it out they know this machine have be mess with they through three different stage of behavior laughter they figure there must be more to it so they poke at it and peck at it and eventually some crow get a bright idea hey there be lot of coin lie around from the first stage hop down pick it up drop it in the slot and we be off to the race that crow enjoy a temporary monopoly on peanut until he friend figure out how to do it and then there we go so what be significant about this to I be not that we can train crow to pick up peanut mind you there be 216 million dollar worth of change lose every year but I be not sure I can depend on that roi from crow laughter instead I think we should look a little bit large I think crow can be train to do other thing for example why not train they to pick up garbage after stadium event or find expensive component from discard electronics or maybe do search and rescue the main point of all this for I be we can find mutually beneficial system for this species we can find way to interact with this other species that do not involve exterminate they but involve find a equilibrium with they that be a useful balance thanks very much applause
