once upon a time there be a dread disease that afflict child and in fact among all the disease that exist in this land it be the bad it kill the most child and along come a brilliant inventor a scientist who come up with a partial cure for that disease and it be not perfect many child still die but it be certainly good than what they have before and one of the good thing about this cure be that it be free virtually free and be very easy to use but the bad thing about it be that you could not use it on the young child on infant and on one year old and so as a consequence a few year later another scientist perhaps maybe this scientist not quite as brilliant as the one who have precede he but build on the invention of the first one come up with a second cure and the beauty of the second cure for this disease be that it could be use on infant and one year old and the problem with this cure be it be very expensive and it be very complicated to use and although parent try as hard as they could to use it properly almost all of they end up use it wrong in the end but what they do of course since it be so complicated and expensive they only use it on the zero year old and the one year old and they keep on use the exist cure that they have on the two year old and up and this go on for quite some time person be happy they have they two cure until a particular mother whose child have just turn two die of this disease and she think to herself my child just turn two and until the child turn two I have always use this complicated expensive cure you know this treatment and then the child turn two and I start use the cheap and easy treatment and I wonder and she wonder like all parent who lose child wonder if there be not something that I could have do like keep on use that complicated expensive cure and she tell all the other person and she say how could it possibly be that something that be cheap and simple work as well as something that be complicated and expensive and the person think you know you be right it probably be the wrong thing to do to switch and use the cheap and simple solution and the government they hear she story and the other person and they say yeah you be right we should make a law we should outlaw this cheap and simple treatment and not let anybody use this on they child and the person be happy they be satisfied for many year this go along and everything be fine but then along come a lowly economist who have child himself and he use the expensive and complicated treatment but he know about the cheap and simple one and he think about it and the expensive one do not seem that great to he so he think I do not know anything about science but I do know something about datum so maybe I should go and look at the datum and see whether this expensive and complicated treatment actually work any good than the cheap and simple one and lo and behold when he go through the datum he find that it do not look like the expensive complicated solution be any good than the cheap one at least for the child who be two and old the cheap one still do not work on the kid who be young and so he go forth to the person and he say I have make this wonderful finding it look as if we could just use the cheap and simple solution and by do so we could save ourselves 300 million dollar a year and we could spend that on we child in other way and the parent be very unhappy and they say this be a terrible thing because how can the cheap and easy thing be as good as the hard thing and the government be very upset and in particular the person who make this expensive solution be very upset because they think how can we hope to compete with something that be essentially free we would lose all of we market and person be very angry and they call he horrible name and he decide that maybe he should leave the country for a few day and seek out some more intelligent open minded person in a place call Oxford and come and try and tell the story at that place and so anyway here I be it be not a fairy tale it be a true story about the United States today and the disease I be refer to be actually motor vehicle accident for child and the free cure be adult seatbelt and the expensive cure the 300 million dollar a year cure be child car seat and what I would like to talk to you about today be some of the evidence why I believe this to be true that for child two year old and up there really be no real benefit prove benefit of car seat in spite of the incredible energy that have be devote toward expand the law and make it socially unacceptable to put you child into seatbelt and then talk about why what be it that make that true and then finally talk a little bit about a third way about another technology which be probably good than anything we have but which there have not be any enthusiasm for adoption precisely because person be so enamored with the current car seat solution ok so many time when you try to do research on datum it record complicated story it be hard to find in the datum it do not turn out to be the case when you look at seatbelt versus car seat so the United States keep a data set of every fatal accident that be happen since 1975 so in every car crash in which at least one person die they have information on all of the person so if you look at that datum it be right up on the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration website you can just look at the raw datum and begin to get a sense of the limited amount of evidence that be in favor of car seat for child age two and up so here be the datum here I have among two to six year old anyone above six basically no one use car seat so you can not compare 29 3 percent of the child who be unrestrained in a crash in which at least one person die themselves die if you put a child in a car seat 18 2 percent of the child die if they be wear a lap and shoulder belt in this raw data 19 4 percent die and interestingly wear a lap only seatbelt 16 7 percent die and actually the theory tell you that the lap only seatbelt be get to be bad than the lap and shoulder belt and that just remind you that when you deal with raw datum there be hundred of confound variable that may be get in the way so what we do in the study be and this be just present the same information but turn into a figure to make it easy so the yellow bar represent car seat the orange bar lap and shoulder and the red bar lap only seatbelt and this be all relative to unrestrained the big the bar the good okay so this be the datum I just show ok so the high bar be what you be strive to beat so you can control for the basic thing like how hard the crash be what seat the child be sit in etc the age of the child and that be that middle set of bar and so you can see that the lap only seatbelt start to look bad once you do that and then finally the last set of bar which be really control for everything you could possibly imagine about the crash 50 75 100 different characteristic of the crash and what you find be that the car seat and the lap and shoulder belt when it come to save life fatality look exactly identical and the standard error band be relatively small around this estimate as well and it be not just overall it be very robust to anything you want to look at one thing that be interesting if you look at frontal impact crash when the car crash the front hit into something indeed what you see be that the car seat look a little bit well and I think this be not just chance in order to have the car seat approve you need to pass certain federal standard all of which involve slam you car into a direct frontal crash but when you look at other type of crash like rear impact crash indeed the car seat do not perform as well and I think that be because they have be optimize to pass as we always expect person to do to optimize relative to bright line rule about how affect the car will be and the other thing you might argue be well car seat have get a lot good over time and so if we look at recent crash the whole datum set be almost 30 year worth of datum you will not see it in the recent crash the new car seat be far far good but indeed in recent crash the lap and shoulder seatbelt actually be do even good than the car seat they say well that be impossible that can not be and the line of argument if you ask parent be but car seat be so expensive and complicated and they have this big tangle of latch how could they possibly not work good than seatbelt because they be so expensive and complicated it be kind of a interesting logic I think that person use and the other logic they say well the government would not have tell we to use they if they be not much good but what be interesting be the government tell we to use they be not actually base on very much it really be base on some impassioned plea of parent whose child die after they turn two which have lead to the passage of all this law not very much on datum so you can only get so far I think in tell you story by use this abstract statistics and so I have some friend over to dinner and I be ask we have a cookout I be ask they what advice they might have for I about prove my point they say why do not you run some crash test and I say that be a great idea so we actually try to commission some crash test and it turn out that as we call around to the independent crash test company around the country none of they want to do we crash test because they say some explicitly some not so explicitly all of we business come from car seat manufacturer we can not risk alienate they by test seatbelt relative to car seat now eventually one do under the condition of anonymity they say they would be happy to do this test for we so anonymity and 1 500 dollar per seat that we crash and so we go to Buffalo New York and here be the precursor to it this be the crash test dummy wait for they chance to take the center stage and then here be how the crash test work here they do not actually crash the entire car you know it be not worth ruin a whole car to do it so they just have this bench seat and they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it so I just want you to look at this and I think this give you a good idea of why parent think car seat be so great look at the kid in the car seat do he not look content ready to go like he could survive anything and then if you look at the kid in back it look like he be already choke before the crash even happen it be hard to believe when you look at this that that kid in back be go to do very well when you get in a crash so this be go to be a crash where they be go to slam this thing forward into a wall at 30 mile a hour and see what happen ok so let I show you what happen this be three year old dummy by the way so here this be the car seat now watch two thing watch how the head go forward and basically hit the knee and this be in the car seat and watch how the car seat fly around in the rebind up in the air the car seat move all over the place Bear in mind there be two thing about this this be a car seat that be install by someone who have install 1 000 car seat who know exactly how to do it and also it turn out this bench seat be the very good way to install car seat have a flat back make it much easy to install they and so this be a test that be very much rig in favor of the car seat ok so that kid in this crash fare very well the federal standard be that you have to score below a 1 000 to be a approve car seat on this crash in some metric of unit which be not important and this crash would have be about a 450 so this car seat be actually a above average car seat from Consumer Reports and do quite well so the next one now this be the kid same crash who be in the seatbelt he hardly move at all actually relative to the other child the funny thing be the cam work be terrible because they have only set it up to do the car seat and so they actually do not even have a way to move the camera so you can see the kid that be on the rebound anyway it turn out that that two crash that actually the three year old do slightly bad so he get about a 500 out of you know on this range relative to a 400 and something but still if you just take that datum from that crash to the federal government and say I have invent a new car seat I would like you to approve it for sell then they would say this be a fantastic new car seat it work great it only get a 500 it could have get as high up as a 1 000 and this seatbelt would have pass with fly color into be approve as a car seat so in some sense what this be suggest be that it be not just that person be set up they car seat wrong which be put child at risk it be just that fundamentally the car seat be not do much so here be the crash so this be time at the same time so you can see that it take much long with the car seat at rebind it take a lot long but there be just a lot less movement for child who be in the seatbelt so I will show you the six year old crash as well the six year old be in a car seat and it turn out that look terrible but that be great that be like a 400 ok so that kid would do fine in the crash nothing about that would have be problematic to the child at all and then here be the six year old in the seatbelt and in fact they get exactly within you know within one or two point of the same so really for the six year old the car seat do absolutely nothing whatsoever that be some more evidence so in some sense I be criticize by a scientist who say you could never publish a study with a n of 4 mean that four crash so I write he back and I say what about a n of 45 004 because I have the other 45 000 other real world crash and I just think that it be interesting that the idea of use real world crash which be very much something that economist think would be the right thing to do be something that scientist do not actually usually think they would rather use a laboratory a very imperfect science of look at the dummy than actually 30 year of datum of what we have see with child and with car seat and so I think the answer to this puzzle be that there be a much good solution out there that be get nobody excited because everyone be so delighted with the way car seat be presumably work and if you think from a design perspective about go back to square one and say I just want to protect kid in the back seat I do not there be anyone in this room who would say well the right way to start would be let make a great seat belt for adult and then let make this really big contraption that you have to rig up to it in this daisy chain I mean why not start who be sit in the back seat anyway except for kid but essentially do something like this which I do not know exactly how much it would cost to do but there be no reason I could see why this should be much more expensive than a regular car seat it be just actually you see this be fold up it be behind the seat you have get a regular seat for adult and then you fold it down and the kid sit on top and it be integrate it seem to I that this can not be a very expensive solution and it be get to work good than what we already have so the question be be there any hope for adoption of something like this which would presumably save a lot of life and I think the answer perhaps lie in a story the answer both to why have a car seat be so successful and why this may someday be adopt or not lie in a story that my dad tell I relate to when he be a doctor in the U S Air Force in England and this be a long time ago you be allow to do thing then you can not do today so my father would have patient come in who he think be not really sick and he have a big jar full of placebo pill that he would give they and he would say come back in a week if you still feel lousy ok and most of they would not come back but some of they would come back and when they come back he still convince they be not sick have another jar of pill in this jar be huge horse pill they be almost impossible to swallow and this to I be the analogy for the car seat person would look at this and say man this thing be so big and so hard to swallow if this do not make I feel well you know what possibly could and it turn out that most person would not come back because it work but every once in a while there be still a patient convince that he be sick and he would come back and my dad have a third jar of pill and the jar of pill he have he say be the tiny little pill he could find so small you could barely see they and he would say listen I know I give you that huge pill that complicated hard to swallow pill before but now I have get one that be so potent that be really tiny and small and almost invisible it be almost like this thing here which you can not even see and it turn out that never in all the time my dad give out this pill the really tiny pill do anyone ever come back still complain of sickness so my dad always take that as evidence that this little teeny powerful pill have the ultimate placebo effect and in some sense if that be the right story I think integrate car seat you will see very quickly become something that everyone have the other possible conclusion be well maybe after come to my father three time get send home with placebo he still feel sick he go and find another doctor and that be completely possible and if that be the case then I think we be stuck with conventional car seat for a long time to come thank you very much applause audience I just want to ask you when we wear seatbelt we do not necessarily wear they just to prevent loss of life it be also to prevent lot of serious injury you datum look at fatality it do not look at serious injury be there any datum to show that child seat be actually less effective or just as effective as seatbelt for serious injury because that would prove you case Steven Levitt yeah that be a great question in my datum and in another data set I have look at for New Jersey crash I find very small difference in injury so in this datum it be statistically insignificant difference in injury between car seat and lap and shoulder belt in the New Jersey datum which be different because it be not just fatal crash but all crash in New Jersey that be report it turn out that there be a 10 percent difference in injury but generally they be the minor injury now what be interesting I should say this as a disclaimer there be medical literature that be very difficult to resolve with this other datum which suggest that car seat be dramatically good and they use a completely different methodology that involve after the crash occur they get from the insurance company the name of the person who be in the crash and they call they on the phone and they ask they what happen and I really can not resolve yet and I would like to work with this medical researcher to try to understand how there can be this difference which be completely at odds with one another but it be obviously a critical question the question be even if be there enough serious injury to make this cost effective it be kind of tricky even if they be right it be not so clear that they be so cost effective
