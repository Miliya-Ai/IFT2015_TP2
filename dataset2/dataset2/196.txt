you know I have talk about some of this project before about the human genome and what that might mean and discover new set of gene we be actually start at a new point we have be digitize biology and now we be try to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with design and synthesize life so we have always be try to ask big question what be life be something that I think many biologist have be try to understand at various level we have try various approach pare it down to minimal component we have be digitize it now for almost 20 year when we sequence the human genome it be go from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer now we be try to ask can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe this be the map of a small organism Mycoplasma genitalium that have the small genome for a species that can self replicate in the laboratory and we have be try to just see if we can come up with a even small genome we be able to knock out on the order of 100 gene out of the 500 or so that be here when we look at its metabolic map it be relatively simple compare to ours trust I this be simple but when we look at all the gene that we can knock out one at a time it be very unlikely that this would yield a living cell so we decide the only way forward be to actually synthesize this chromosome so we could vary the component to ask some of this most fundamental question and so we start down the road of can we synthesize a chromosome can chemistry permit make this really large molecule where we have never be before and if we do can we boot up a chromosome a chromosome by the way be just a piece of inert chemical material so we pace of digitize life have be increase at a exponential pace we ability to write the genetic code have be move pretty slowly but have be increase and we late point would put it on now a exponential curve we start this over 15 year ago it take several stage in fact start with a bioethical review before we do the first experiment but it turn out synthesize dna be very difficult there be ten of thousand of machine around the world that make small piece of dna 30 to 50 letter in length and it be a degenerate process so the long you make the piece the more error there be so we have to create a new method for put this little piece together and correct all the error and this be we first attempt start with the digital information of the genome of phi x174 it be a small virus that kill bacterium we design the piece go through we error correction and have a dna molecule of about 5 000 letter the exciting phase come when we take this piece of inert chemical and put it in the bacterium and the bacterium start to read this genetic code make the viral particle the viral particle then be release from the cell and come back and kill the e coli I be talk to the oil industry recently and I say they clearly understand that model laughter they laugh more than you guy be laughter and so we think this be a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system but we want to go much large we want to build the entire bacterial chromosome it be over 580 000 letter of genetic code so we think we have build they in cassette the size of the virus so we could actually vary the cassette to understand what the actual component of a living cell be design be critical and if you be start with digital information in the computer that digital information have to be really accurate when we first sequence this genome in 1995 the standard of accuracy be one error per 10 000 base pair we actually find on resequence it 30 error have we use that original sequence it never would have be able to be boot up part of the design be design piece that be 50 letter long that have to overlap with all the other 50 letter piece to build small subunit we have to design so they can go together we design unique element into this you may have read that we put watermark in think of this we have a four letter genetic code a c g and t triplet of that letter code for roughly 20 amino acid such that there be a single letter designation for each of the amino acid so we can use the genetic code to write out word sentence think initially all we do be autograph it some person be disappoint there be not poetry we design this piece so we can just chew back with enzyme there be enzyme that repair they and put they together and we start make piece start with piece that be 5 000 to 7 000 letter put that together to make 24 000 letter piece then put set of that go up to 72 000 at each stage we grow up this piece in abundance so we could sequence they because we be try to create a process that be extremely robust that you can see in a minute we be try to get to the point of automation so this look like a basketball playoff when we get into this really large piece over 100 000 base pair they will not any long grow readily in e coli it exhaust all the modern tool of molecular biology and so we turn to other mechanism we know there be a mechanism call homologous recombination that biology use to repair dna that can put piece together here be a example of it there be a organism call Deinococcus radioduran that can take three million rad of radiation you can see in the top panel its chromosome just get blow apart twelve to 24 hour later it put it back together exactly as it be before we have thousand of organism that can do this this organism can be totally desiccated they can live in a vacuum I be absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space move around find a new aqueous environment in fact NASA have show a lot of this be out there here be a actual micrograph of the molecule we build use this process actually just use yeast mechanism with the right design of the piece we put they in yeast put they together automatically this be not a electron micrograph this be just a regular photomicrograph it be such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope this be picture over about a six second period so this be the publication we have just a short while ago this be over 580 000 letter of genetic code it be the large molecule ever make by human of a define structure it be over 300 million molecular weight if we print it out at a 10 font with no spacing it take 142 page just to print this genetic code well how do we boot up a chromosome how do we activate this obviously with a virus it be pretty simple it be much more complicated deal with bacterium it be also simple when you go into eukaryote like ourselves you can just pop out the nucleus and pop in another one and that be what you have all hear about with clone with bacterium and Archaea the chromosome be integrate into the cell but we recently show that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it we purify a chromosome from one microbial species roughly this two be as distant as human and mouse we add a few extra gene so we could select for this chromosome we digest it with enzyme to kill all the proteins and it be pretty stunning when we put this in the cell and you will appreciate we very sophisticated graphic here the new chromosome go into the cell in fact we think this might be as far as it go but we try to design the process a little bit far this be a major mechanism of evolution right here we find all kind of species that have take up a second chromosome or a third one from somewhere add thousand of new trait in a second to that species so person who think of evolution as just one gene change at a time have miss much of biology there be enzyme call restriction enzyme that actually digest dna the chromosome that be in the cell do not have one the chromosome we put in do it get express and it recognize the other chromosome as foreign material chew it up and so we end up just with a cell with the new chromosome it turn blue because of the gene we put in it and with a very short period of time all the characteristic of one species be lose and it convert totally into the new species base on the new software that we put in the cell all the proteins change the membrane change when we read the genetic code it be exactly what we have transfer in so this may sound like genomic alchemy but we can by move the software of dna around change thing quite dramatically now I have argue this be not genesis this be build on three and a half billion year of evolution and I have argue that we be about to perhaps create a new version of the Cambrian explosion where there be massive new speciation base on this digital design why do this I think this be pretty obvious in term of some of the need we be about to go from six and a half to nine billion person over the next 40 year to put it in context for myself I be bear in 1946 there be now three person on the planet for every one of we that exist in 1946 within 40 year there will be four we have trouble feed provide fresh clean water medicine fuel for the six and a half billion it be go to be a stretch to do it for nine we use over five billion ton of coal 30 billion plus barrel of oil that be a hundred million barrel a day when we try to think of biological process or any process to replace that it be go to be a huge challenge then of course there be all that co2 from this material that end up in the atmosphere we now from we discovery around the world have a database with about 20 million gene and I like to think of this as the design component of the future the electronics industry only have a dozen or so component and look at the diversity that come out of that we be limit here primarily by a biological reality and we imagination we now have technique because of this rapid method of synthesis to do what we be call combinatorial genomic we have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosome a day when you think of process this 20 million different gene or try to optimize process to produce octane or to produce pharmaceutical new vaccine we can just with a small team do more molecular biology than the last 20 year of all science and it be just standard selection we can select for viability chemical or fuel production vaccine production etc this be a screen snapshot of some true design software that we be work on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer you know we do not know necessarily what it will look like we know exactly what they genetic code look like we be focus on now fourth generation fuel you have see recently corn to ethanol be just a bad experiment we have second and third generation fuel that will be come out relatively soon that be sugar to much high value fuel like octane or different type of butanol but the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increase the cost of food and limit its availability be if we start with co2 as its feedstock and so we be work with design cell to go down this road and we think we will have the first fourth generation fuel in about 18 month sunlight and co2 be one method applause but in we discovery around the world we have all kind of other method this be a organism we describe in 1996 it live in the deep ocean about a mile and a half deep almost at boil water temperature it take co2 to methane use molecular hydrogen as its energy source we be look to see if we can take capture co2 which can easily be pipe to site convert that co2 back into fuel to drive this process so in a short period of time we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question be of what be life we truly you know have modest goal of replace the whole petrol chemical industry laughter applause yeah if you can not do that at TED where can you laughter become a major source of energy but also we be now work on use this same tool to come up with instant set of vaccine you have see this year with flu we be always a year behind and a dollar short when it come to the right vaccine I think that can be change by build combinatorial vaccine in advance here be what the future may begin to look like with change now the evolutionary tree speed up evolution with synthetic bacterium Archaea and eventually eukaryote we be a way away from improve person we goal be just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that thank you very much applause
