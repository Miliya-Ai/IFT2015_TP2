you all know this story in the summer of 1950 Enrico Fermi the Italian American physicist and atomic pile builder go to lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratory and join some colleague there and ask they a question where be everybody this confuse he colleague obviously because they be sit right there with he and then he have to clarify that he be not talk about they he be talk about the space alien you see this be only a few year after the suppose fly saucer crash at Roswell New Mexico and even though that turn out to be nothing nothing at all laughter merely a down weather balloon pilot by small hairless man with slit for mouth still America have go saucer mad even famous scientist who be eat lunch Fermi reasoning if I may paraphrase badly be that the universe be so vast that it stand to reason there should be other intelligent life out there and the universe be so old that unless we be the very first civilization ever to evolve we should have some evidence of they existence by now and yet to the good of we knowledge we be alone where be everybody ask Fermi and he colleague have no answer Fermi then go on with the same blunt logic to disprove fairy Sasquatch God the possibility of love and thereafter as you know Enrico Fermi eat alone laughter now I be not a scientist I have never build a atomic pile although I might argue that technically every pile be atomic laughter however with respect I might point out two possibility that Enrico Fermi perhaps do not consider one be that the alien might be very far away perhaps I dare say even on other planet the other possibility laughter be perhaps Enrico Fermi himself be a alien laughter think about it be not it a little convenient that in the midst of the World War out of nowhere suddenly a Italian scientist show up with a amazing new technology that would transform everything in the world and darken the history of the human species forever after and be not it a little strange that he require no payment for this that he ask for only one thing a gift of two healthy sperm whale that be that be not true but it be strange laughter and if Enrico Fermi be indeed a space alien would not he be the first to have try to convince he fellow scientist that the space alien be not already here for it be give in certain UFO ology or ufology circle that the alien be already here and have be for millennia that they have walk among we in disguise observe we guide we evolution from ape to man if you believe in that sort of thing and occasionally kidnap we in they fly saucer and take we away to have sex with we in pyramid laughter it be a difficult theory to discount I think you will agree laughter for even in my own life there be memory I have that be difficult to explain happen that be so odd and unaccountably weird that it be difficult to imagine they be not the result of prolong and frequent contact with alien throughout my life for how else will you explain the amazing and absolutely true close encounter that I have and will describe to you now encounter one Ocean City New Jersey 1980 this be the summer when the special edition of close encounter of the Third Kind be release and I go on vacation with my parent to the Jersey shore within 12 hour I be horribly sunburned just like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie laughter and so I spend the rest of the vacation largely sit outside we little rental house at night the sidewalk still warm from the sun watch the sky for ufo what do I see star satellite blink airplane typical sky junk occasionally kid would come and join I and watch but they neck soon get sore and they would go off to the boardwalk to play video game and mingle with human I be pretty good at the video game I be not very good at the other part so I stay alone with the cosmos and that be when it happen a elderly couple come walk down the street I would say they be in they late seventy and I would say that they be on a date because he be wear a very neat little suit with a yellow tie a brown suit and she be wear a cardigan because it be now fully night and a chill be come in off the ocean I remember for some reason that they be exactly the same height and then they stop and the man turn to I and say what be you look for fly saucer laughter you have to admit that be a pretty boss piece of detective work for a old man on a date but what be stranger still and even I realize it at the time as a nine year old child be that they stop at all that this old man would interrupt he moonlight stroll with he sweetheart with the precise reason of make fun of a child oh he say little green man and then he girlfriend join in too there be no such thing as space man she say there be no such thing and then they both laugh ha ha ha I look around the street be entirely empty I have stop hear the sound of the ocean it be as though time have stop I do not know why they be tease I I look into they strangely angry face and I remember wonder be they wear rubber mask laughter and what would be behind that rubber mask if they be giant almond shape unblinking eye slit for mouth the old man crooked he finger as though he be fire a gun and then he make laser sound Kew kew kew watch out and they turn at once and walk away the old man reach out he knobbly claw for the woman hand and find it and leave I alone now you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding a strange encounter among human maybe it be swamp gas but laughter I know what I see close encounter two Brookline Massachusetts 1984 I go to see the movie dune and a girl talk to I now on its face laughter this be impossible on its face I realize but it be absolutely true it be open night naturally I go with my friend Tim McGonigal who sit on my left on my right be the girl in question she have long curly black hair a blue jean jacket I remember she have some sort of injury to she ankle a Ace bandage and she have crutch she be very tall I would say I be start high school at the time I would say she be a junior but I have never see she before she do not go to my school I do not know she name and I never will she be sit with someone who I presume be she mother and they be talk about the novel dune they be both big fan mother and daughter very unusual they be talk about how they favorite character be the giant sandworm and then it get stranger that be when she turn to I and say be you look forward to see the movie laughter First of all I be embarrassed because I have not read the novel dune at that time I be merely a connoisseur of movie feature desert planet as I still be laughter but it be also the tone of how she ask the question apropo of nothing like she do not even care about the answer as though she just want to talk to I I do not know what to say I say yes I do not even turn my head the movie begin I need not remind you that this be David Lynch version of Dune in which all of the character be sexy and deform at the same time laughter there be a character call the Third Stage Guild Navigator which be a kind of giant float fetus creature that live in a giant tank with this orange mist of psychedelic spice swirl around he allow he to bend space and time he could never leave the tank or interact with the outside world he have become in he isolation so deform and so sexy that he have to talk through a kind of old timey radio to the outside world and could never touch they I mean I like he a lot good than the sandworm the sandworm be fine but you favorite character please when the movie end everyone seem very happy to get up and get out of the theatre as soon as possible except for the girl as I walk out she pace slow perhaps it be the crutch but it seem laughter it seem as though she might want to talk to I again when I say it out loud it sound so ridiculous but I can only come to the conclusion that it be what in the alien abductee community they call a screen memory a ridiculous false recollection design by they brain to cover up some trauma say of be kidnap and fly off to a sex pyramid laughter and so I sure be glad I do not slow down to talk to she I sure be glad I never see she again close encounter three Philadelphia Pennsylvania 1989 in the mid to late 80 the novelist Whitley Strieber write a book call Communion in which he describe he own lifelong experience be abduct by alien and he also describe the phenomenon know in this community as lose time where Whitley Strieber would suddenly become aware that he could not remember the previous ten minute or the previous ten hour or the previous ten day and would come to the conclusion that that be when the alien be take he and give he rectal probe laughter this book become naturally a enormous good seller this image by Ted Joseph be from that book and be he sort of police sketch of what the creature look like that Whitley Strieber have describe to he and it be so successful that they make it into a movie and in 1989 the way I remember it I be in Philadelphia visit my girlfriend and we decide apropo of nothing to go see this movie and the way I remember it the movie feature this detail one Whitley Strieber be play by Christopher Walken two the alien be play by a rubber puppet laughter three there be a surprisingly long sequence of the film in which the rubber puppet give Christopher Walken a rectal probe four this be be show in a regular movie theater in Center City Philadelphia five all of which be to say they make a movie out of the book Communion and it star Christopher Walken do something seem strange about this to you something odd something off something wrong with this picture think about it yes the answer be I have a girlfriend what laughter how do this happen when do this happen I remember walk out of the theater and become suddenly aware of this fact as we walk hand in hand and ponder this very same question and to this day I have no answer for you close encounter four the Algarve Portugal 1991 some year later I and this woman we will call she Catherine Fletcher laughter go travel through the south of Portugal together we stay in old crumble walled city in tiny little hotel and we would climb up to the roof and drink Vinho Verde and watch the sun set and play checkers what do we do this really do anyone do this we go to some topless beach excuse I no not in my life for what it be worth we go to Sagres which be consider at the time to be the end of the world and there I be chase by a pack of feral dog on the dock and the lead dog bite I on the ass require I to go to a strange Portuguese clinic and receive a ass shoot make of that what you will laughter we last day in Portugal we be in the district capital of Faro and Catherine decide that she want to go to the beach one last time now Faro be a bustling little city and to get to the beach she explain you would have to take a bus and then a boat and do I want to come with but I be exhausted and dog bite and so I say no I remember what she look like before she leave the freckle have grow and multiply on she face and shoulder cluster into a kind of a tan a tan we be both tan be this true she eye be extra bright and extra blue as a result she be smile she be a single woman about to go alone into a country not even speak the language to travel alone by bus and boat to go to a beach she do not know or have never see I love she and then she go out into that strange alien land it take I some time to come to my sen I have my own lost time moment where I wake up and suddenly realize it be very late in the day almost dinnertime and she have not come back nervous I go down to the street to look for she now I do not speak Portuguese I do not know where the beach be I could not call she on a cell phone because this be 1991 and the alien have not give we that technology yet laughter I realize that the day would only have two possible outcome either Catherine would come back to the hotel or she would never come back to the hotel and so I sit down to wait I do not watch the sky but the very end of the street where the bus and car and pedestrian and little scooter be move along and I watch that constellation shift hope that they would part and I would see she face it be at that moment in that very small town of 30 000 or so that I truly appreciate the vastness of the universe and the searching we might do in it and that be when the Liberian come along five young man all laugh happy travel together come back to this hotel where they be stay one of they be name Joseph and he ask I what be I do and I explain and he say do not worry he be sure that Catherine would be safe but he do not seem so very sure for he sit down to wait with I and for the next two hour they all wait with I take turn go up to they room come back tell I joke distract I two hour they give I a message we be not alone and then in the middle of a sentence at the very birth of twilight I turn and look down the street the star align and she come back she be smile she do not understand why I be so worried neither do the Liberian although there be a huge amount of relief in they laughter as they clap we on the back and go back up to they room and leave we alone in the street hold hand a event like this leave a scar on the memory much like a piece of alien technology that have be insert into you buttock by a Portuguese doctor laughter and even now a decade and a half later even now that we be marry I look for she still whenever she be not in the room and even though I think you will agree it be probable that during the time she be away she be kidnap and replace by a alien clone I love she and wait for she still thank you for you kind attention applause
