that of we who believe in heaven have some sort of idea of what heaven would be and in my idea heaven be satisfied curiosity I think of heaven as a really comfortable cloud where I can just lie down with my belly down like I be watch tv when I be a child and my elbow up and I can basically look everywhere I want see every movie I have always want to see and in the same kind of trance that you can feel sometimes in the subway in New York when you be read there be something really soothing and easy well the funny thing be that I already have that kind of life in a way because I discover it take I a while to understand it but when I discover around 24 year of age that I be much more comfortable with object than with person I finally decide to really embrace this passion and I basically live my life in sort of a trance and I look around and everything I see be just the beginning of a long story just to give you a example this be the exhibition humble Masterpieces as it be at MoMA in 2004 we be in Queens we be build the big big big big building in Midtown so we be in the small small small boondock that be one of the funn moment of my career but it be not only that the typeface the typeface be Helvetica it be its 50th anniversary this year and so I start think Max Miedinger and all that Swiss designer together try to outdo Akzidenz Grotesk and come up with a new san serif typeface and the movie start play in my head already and of course you can imagine with humble Masterpieces it be the same thing multiply by a hundred and I do hope by the way that the real goal of the exhibition be go to have the same effect on you the exhibition be mean to be a way to have child think of do you know when they do homework at home instead of have a tray with two pea I be hope that they would go into the kitchen cabinet or the mother handbag and do they museum quality design collection on a tray so everybody be always suggest new humble masterpiece and at MoMA we put out some book just for person to suggest they own humble masterpiece and when you do that usually you get 80 percent porn and 20 percent real suggestion and instead it be all almost all good suggestion and a lot of nationalism come in for instance I do not know that the Spaniards invent the mop but they be very proud so every spaniard say la frego and Italian do the pizza and I want to show you also the suggestion from Kentucky be pretty good they have moonshine laundry detergent and liquid nail and I keep it go and I just get laughter also this suggestion from Milan it be we traffic divider which we call panettone and it be paint it be this beautiful concrete thing that you use around Milan to define all the lane of traffic so think of you own send they on if you want to they be always welcome but a exhibition like that make I understand even more what I have be think of for 13 year ever since I get to MoMA I be Italian in Italy design be normal different part of the world have a knack for different thing I be just recently in Argentina and in Uruguay and the default way of build home in the country be a beautiful modernism that you do not see elsewhere but the contemporary art be terrible in Italy in Milan especially contemporary art really do not have that much of a place but design oh my god what you find at the store at the corner without go to any kind of fancy store be the kind of refined design that make everybody think that we be all so sophisticated it be just what you find at the store and New York have another kind of knack for contemporary art I be always amazed three year old know who Richard Serra be and take you to the gallery but design for some reason be still misunderstand for decoration it be really interesting what many person think when I say the word design be they think of this kind of overdesign in this case it be overdesign on purpose but decoration interior decoration they think of somebody choose fabric design can be that of course but it can also be this it can be a school of design in Jerusalem that try to find a good way to design gas mask for person because as you know Israel deploy one gas mask per person include baby so what this designer do be they find a way to lower the neckline so that instead of be completely strangle a teenager can also sip a Coke they try to make a toddler gas mask in such a way that the toddler can be hold by the parent because proximity of the body be so important and then they make a little tent for the baby however cruel however ruthless you can think this be it be a great design and it be mile away from the fancy furniture but still it be part of my same field of passion what I have be do at MoMA since the beginning be to try to harness the power of moma because it be great to work there you really have power in that person usually tend to know about you exhibition or see the exhibition and that be power because in a design museum I would not have as many visitor I be very well aware that 80 percent of my public be there to see Picasso and Matisse and then they stumble upon my show and I keep they there but what I have be try to do be something that the curator at MoMA in my department have be do ever since the museum be find in 1929 which be to try and see what be go on in the world and try to use that authority in order to make thing well there have be many episode and actually Eames Demetrius may be here in the audience but in two instance he great grandfather grandfather I be always a little perplexed about the relation exactly Charles Eames the first time and then Charles and Ray Eames the second time be involve in two competition one in 1940 it be about organic furniture and the second one in 1948 be low cost furniture for the gi come back from the war that then spark a whole line of furniture and then there be good design for very low price there be a lot of program in architecture and design that be about point person in the direction of a good design for a good life so I start out in 95 with this exhibition that be call mutant material in Contemporary Design it be about a new phase in my opinion in the world of design in that material could be customize by the designer themselves and that put I in touch with such diverse design example as the aerogel from the Lawrence Livermore Lab in California at that time they be begin to be bring into the civilian market and at the same time the gorgeous work of Takeshi Ishiguro who do this beautiful salt and pepper container that be make of rice dough so you see the range be really quite diverse and then for instance this other exhibition that be entitle Workspheres in 2001 where I ask different designer to come up with idea for the new type of work style that be happen in the world at that time and you see IDEO there it be beautiful it be call Personal Skies the idea be that if you have a cubicle you could project a sky on top of you head and have you own Cielo in Una Stanza a sky in a room it be a very famous Italian song and other example this be Marti Guixe about work on the go and Hella Jongerius my favorite about how to work at home and this let I introduce a very important idea about design designer be the big synthesizer in the world what they do good be make a synthesis of human need current condition in economy in material in sustainability issue and then what they do at the end if they be good be much more than the sum of its part Hella Jongerius be a person that be able to make a synthesis that be really quite amazing and also quite hilarious the idea behind she work be that at that time everybody be say you have to really divide you life instead she say no no work and leisure can be together yeah that be particularly gorgeous it be the tv dinner of 2001 there have be many other exhibition in the meantime but I do not want to focus on my show I would like instead to talk about how great some designer be I have always have a hard time with the word maverick I come to the United States 13 year ago and to this day I have to ask what do that mean so this morning I go to see on the dictionary and it say that there be this gentleman that be not brand its cattle therefore he be not follow everybody lead and therefore he be a maverick so designer do need to be maverick because the good way to design a successful object and also a object that we be miss before be to pretend that either it never exist or that person will be able to have a new behavior with it so safe be the last exhibition that I do at MoMA and it end at the beginning of last year it be about design that deal with safety and deal with protection it be a long story because it start before 2001 and it be call emergency and then when 9 11 happen I have a shock and I cancel the exhibition until slowly but surely it come back as a half full glass instead of half empty and it be about protection and safety but it range from such item as a complete de mining equipment to this kind of water sterilize straw so it be really wide range it also have you know Cameron and I work a little bit together and some of the entry that you see in he website be actually in the exhibition but what be interesting be that we do not need to talk about design and art anymore design use whatever tool it have at its disposal in order to make a point it be a sense of economy and a sense also of humor this be a beautiful project by Ralph Borland who be south African it be a suit for civil disobedience the idea be that when you have a riot or a protest and the police come towards you you be wear this thing it be like a big heart and it have a loudspeaker over you heart so you heartbeat be amplify and the police be remind it be like have a flower in front of the rifle and also you can imagine a whole group of person with the same suit will have this mount collective heartbeat that will be scary to the police so designer sometimes do not do thing that be immediately functional but they be functional to we understand of issue Tony Dunne and Fiona Raby do this series of object that be about we anguish and we paranoia like this hideaway furniture that be make in the same wood as you floor so it disappear completely and you can hide away or even good the huggable atomic mushroom which get I a article on the Bulletin of Atomic scientist of the United States I do not think it ever happen before at MoMA or this Faraday Chair that be suppose to protect you from radiation but the interesting thing in the exhibition be the discovery that the ultimate shelter be you sense of self and there be quite a few designer that be work on this particular topic this be Cindy van den Bremen who be a dutch designer that be do this series of Capsters they be athletic gear for Muslim woman that enable they to ski play tennis do whatever they want to do without have to uncap themselves and sometimes by do this kind of research you encounter such beautiful idea of design Twan Verdonck be really young I think he be 27 and work together with some psychologist he do a series of toy that be for sensorial stimulation for child that have psychological impairment they be quite beautiful they range from this fluffy toy that be about hug you because autistic child like to be hug tight so it have a spring inside all the way to this doll with a mirror so the child can see he or herself in the mirror and regain a sense of self design really look upon the whole world and it consider the world in all of its different range I be recently at a conference on luxury organize by the Herald Tribune in Istanbul and it be really interesting because I be the last speaker and before I there be person that be really talk about luxury and I do not want to be a party pooper but at the same time I feel that I have to kind of bring back the discourse to reality and the truth be that there be very different kind of luxury and there be luxury that be relative for person that do not have that much I want to make this point by show you two example of design come from a sense of economy very very clear limit this be Cuba and this be the recycling of a squeaky toy as a bicycle bell and this be a raincoat that be make out of rice sack so they be quite beautiful but they be beautiful because they be so smart and economical and here be the work of two brother from Sao Paulo Fernando and Humberto Campana who get inspire by the poverty and smartness that they see around they to do piece of furniture that now be sell for a enormous amount of money but that be because of the kind of strangeness of the market itself so really design take everything into account and the interesting thing be that as the technology advance as we become more and more wireless and impalpable designer instead want we to be hand on sometimes hammer on this be a whole series of furniture that want to engage you physically even this chair that you have to open up and then sit on so that it take you imprint all the way to this beautiful series of object that be consider design by Ana Mir in Barcelona from this kind of bijou make with human hair to this chocolate nipple to this intra toe candy that you lover be suppose to suck from you toe laughter it be quite beautiful because somehow this be a gorgeous moment for design many year ago I hear a mathematician from Vienna whose name be Marchetti explain how the innovation in the military industry therefore secret innovation and the innovation in the civilian society be two sinusoid that be kind of opposed and that make sense in moment of war there be great technological innovation and in the world you have to do without well during the Second World War you have to do without steel you have to do without aluminum and then as peace come all of this technology get all of a sudden available for the civilian market many of you might know that the Potato Chip Chair by Charles and Ray Eames come exactly from that kind of instance fiberglass be available for civilian use all of a sudden I think that this be a strange moment the rhythm of the sinusoid have change tremendously just like the rhythm of we life in the past 25 year so I be not sure anymore what the wavelength be but it surely be a very important moment for design because not only be the technology proceed not only be compute technology make open source possible also in the world of design but also the idea of sustainability which be not only sustainability from the viewpoint of co2 emission and footprint but also sustainability of human interrelationship be very much part of the work of so many designer and that be why designer more and more be work on behavior rather than on object especially the good one not all of they I want to show you for instance the work of Mathieu Lehanneur which be quite fantastic he be another young designer from France who be work and at this point he be work also with pharmaceutical company on new way to engage patient especially child in take they medicine with constancy and with certainty for instance this be a beautiful container for asthma medicine that kind of inflate itself when it be time for you to take the medicine so the child have to go pffff to release and relieve the container itself and this other medicine be something that you can draw on you skin so intradermal delivery enable you to joyfully be involve in this particular kind of delivery similarly there be the work of person like Marti Guixe that try to involve you in a way that be really about make everything pass through you mouth so that you learn from you mistake or from you taste orally the next show that I be go to work on and I have be bug a lot of you about this here be about the relationship between design and science I be try to find not the metaphor but rather the point in common the common gripe the common issue the common preoccupation and I think that it will enable we to go a little far in this idea of design as a instruction as a direction rather than a prescription of form and I be hope that many of you will respond to this I have send a email already to quite a few of you but design and science and the possibility of visualize different scale and therefore really work at the scale of the very small to make it very big and very meaningful thank you applause
