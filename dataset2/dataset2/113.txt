I get ask a lot what the difference between my work be and typical Pentagon long range strategic planner and the answer I like to offer be what they typically do be they think about the future of war in the context of war and what I have spend 15 year do in this business and it be take I almost 14 to figure it out be I think about the future of war in the context of everything else so I tend to specialize on the scene between war and peace the material I be go to show you be one idea from a book with a lot of idea it be the one that take I around the world right now interact with foreign military quite a bit the material be generate in two year of work I do for the Secretary of Defense think about a new national grand strategy for the United States I be go to present a problem and try to give you a answer here be my favorite bonehead concept from the 1990 in the Pentagon the theory of anti access area denial asymmetrical strategy why do we call it that because it be get all that a be line up I guess this be gobbledygook for if the United States fight somebody we be go to be huge they be go to be small and if they try to fight we in the traditional straight up manner we be go to kick they ass which be why person do not try to do that any more I meet the last Air Force General who have actually shoot down a enemy plane in combat he be now a one star General that be how distant we be from even meet a air force willing to fly against ours so that overmatched capability create problem catastrophic success the White House call they laughter and we be try to figure that out because it be a amazing capability the question be what be the good you can do with it ok the theory of anti access area denial asymmetrical strategy gobbledygook that we sell to Congress because if we just tell they we can kick anybody ass they would not buy we all the stuff we want so we say area denial anti access asymmetrical strategy and they eye glaze over laughter and they say will you build it in my district laughter applause here be my parody and it be not much of one let talk about a battle space I do not know Taiwan Straits 2025 let talk about a enemy embed within that battle space I do not know the million man swim laughter the United States have to access that battle space instantaneously they throw up anti access area denial asymmetrical strategy a banana peel on the tarmac laughter Trojan horse on we computer network reveal all we Achilles heel instantly we say China it be yours Prometheus approach largely a geographic definition focus almost exclusively on the start of conflict we field the first half team in a league that insist on keep score until the end of the game that be the problem we can run the score up against anybody and then get we ass kick in the second half what they call fourth generation warfare here be the way I like to describe it instead there be no battle space the U S Military can not access they say we could not do Afghanistan we do it with ease they say we could not do Iraq we do it with 150 combat casualty in six week we do it so fast we be not prepare for they collapse there be nobody we can not take down the question be what do you do with the power so there be no trouble access battle space what we have trouble access be the transition space that must naturally follow and create the peace space that allow we to move on Problem be the Defense Department over here beat the hell out of you the State Department over here say come on boy I know you can make it and that poor country run off that ledge do that cartoon thing and then drop laughter this be not about overwhelming force but proportional force it be about non lethal technology because if you fire real ammo into a crowd of woman and child rioting you be go to lose friend very quickly this be not about project power but about stay power which be about legitimacy with the local who do you access in this transition space you have to create internal partner you have to access coalition partner we ask the Indian for 17 000 peace keeper I know they senior leadership they want to give it to we but they say to we you know what in that transition space you be mostly hat not enough cattle we do not think you can pull it off we be not go to give you we 17 000 peace keeper for fodder we ask the Russian for 40 000 they say no I be in China in August I say you should have 50 000 peace keeper in Iraq it be you oil not ours which be the truth it be they oil and the Chinese say to I Dr Barnett you be absolutely right in a perfect world we would have 50 000 there but it be not a perfect world and you administration be not get we any close but we have trouble access we outcome we luck out frankly on the selection we face different opponent across this three and it be time to start admit you can not ask the same 19 year old to do it all day in and day out it be just too damn hard we have a unparalleled capacity to wage war we do not do the everything else so well frankly we do it good than anybody and we still suck at it we have a brilliant Secretary of War we do not have a Secretary of everything else because if we do that guy would be in front of the Senate still testify over Abu Ghraib the problem be he do not exist there be no secretary of everything else I think we have a unparalleled capacity to wage war I call that the Leviathan Force what we need to build be a force for the everything else I call they the System Administrators what I think this really represent be lack of a a to z rule set for the world as a whole for process politically bankrupt state we have one for process economically bankrupt state it be the IMF Sovereign Bankruptcy Plan ok we argue about it every time we use it Argentina just go through it break a lot of rule they get out on the far end we say Fine do not worry about it it be transparent a certain amount of certainty give the sense of a non zero outcome we do not have one for process politically bankrupt state that frankly everybody want go like Saddam like Mugabe like Kim Jong Il person who kill in hundred of thousand or million like the 250 000 dead so far in Sudan what would a a to z system look like I be go to distinguish between what I call front half and back half and let call this red line I do not know mission accomplished laughter applause what we have extant right now at the beginning of this system be the U N Security Council as a grand jury what can they do they can indict you ass they can debate it they can write it on a piece of paper they can put it in a envelope and mail it to you and then say in no uncertain term please cut that out laughter that get you about four million dead in Central Africa over the 1990 that get you 250 000 dead in the Sudan in the last 15 month everybody be get to answer they grandchild some day what you do about the holocaust in Africa and you well have a answer we do not have anything to translate that will into action what we do have be the U S enable Leviathan Force that say you want I to take that guy down I will take that guy down I will do it on Tuesday it will cost you 20 billion dollar laughter but here be the deal as soon as I can not find anybody else to air out I leave the scene immediately that be call the Powell Doctrine Way downstream we have the International Criminal Court they love to put they on trial they have get Milosevi right now what be we miss a functioning executive that will translate will into action because we do not have it every time we lead one of this effort we have to whip ourselves into this imminent threat thing we have not face a imminent threat since the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 but we use this language from a bygone era to scare ourselves into do something because we be a democracy and that be what it take and if that do not work we scream he be get a gun just as we rush in laughter and then we look over the body and we find a old cigarette light and we say Jesus it be dark laughter do you want to do it France France say no but I do like to criticize you after the fact what we need downstream be a great power enable what I call that Sys Admin Force we should have have 250 000 troops stream into Iraq on the heel of that Leviathan sweep towards Baghdad what do you get then no loot no military disappear no arm disappear no ammo disappear no Muqtada Al Sadr I be wreck he bone no insurgency talk to anybody who be over there in the first six month we have six month to feel the lob to get the job do and we dick around for six month and then they turn on we why because they just get feed up they see what we do to Saddam they say you be that powerful you can resurrect this country you be America what we need be a international reconstruction fund Sebastian Mallaby Washington Post great idea Model on the IMF instead of pass the hat each time ok where be we go to find this guy g20 that be easy check out they agenda since 9 11 all security dominate they be go to decide up front how the money get spend just like in the IMF you vote accord to how much money you put in the kitty here be my challenge to the Defense Department you have get to build this force you have get to seed this force you have get to track coalition partner create a record of success you will get this model you tell I it be too hard to do I will walk this dog right through that six part series on the Balkans we do it just like that I be talk about regularize it make it transparent would you like Mugabe go would you like Kim Jong Il who be kill about two million person would you like he go would you like a good system this be why it matter to the military they have be experience a identity crisis since the end of the Cold War I be not talk about the difference between reality and desire which I can do because I be not inside the beltway laughter I be talk about the 1990 the Berlin Wall fall we do Desert Storm the split start to emerge between that in the military who see a future they can live with and that who see a future that start to scare they like the U S submarine community which watch the Soviet Navy disappear overnight ah laughter so they start move from reality towards desire and they create they own special language to describe they voyage of self discovery and self actualization laughter the problem be you need a big sexy opponent to fight against and if you can not find one you have get to make one up China all grow up go to be a looker laughter the rest of the military get drag down into the muck across the 1990 and they develop this very derisive term to describe it military operation other than war I ask you who join the military to do thing other than war actually most of they Jessica Lynch never plan on shoot back most of they do not pick up a rifle I maintain this be code inside the Army for we do not want to do this they spend the 1990 work the messy scene between globalize part of the world what I call the core and the gap the Clinton administration be not interested in run this for eight year after screw up the relationship on day one inauguration day with gay in the military which be deft laughter so we be home alone for eight year and what do we do home alone we buy one military and we operate another it be like the guy who go to the doctor and say Doctor it hurt when I do this laughter the doctor say stop do that you idiot I use to give this brief inside the Pentagon in the early 1990 I would say you be buy one military and you be operate another and eventually it be go to hurt it be wrong bad Pentagon bad laughter and they would say Dr Barnett you be so right can you come back next year and remind we again laughter some person say 9 11 heal the rift jerk the long term transformation guru out of they 30 000 foot view of history drag they down in to the muck and say you want a networked opponent I have get one he be everywhere go find he it elevate MOOTW how we pronounce that acronym from crap to grand strategy because that be how you be go to shrink that gap some person put this two thing together and they call it empire which I think be a boneheaded concept empire be about the enforcement of not just minimal rule set which you can not do but maximum rule set which you must do it be not we system of governance never how we have seek to interact with the outside world I prefer that phrase System Administration we enforce the minimal rule set for maintain connectivity to the global economy certain bad thing you can not do how this impact the way we think about the future of war this be a concept which get I vilify throughout the Pentagon it make I very popular as well everybody be get a opinion go back to the beginning of we country historically defens mean protection of the homeland security have mean everything else write into we constitution two different force two different function raise a army when you need it and maintain a navy for day to day connectivity A Department of War a Department of everything else a big stick a baton stick can of whup ass the networking force in 1947 we merge this two thing together in the Defense Department we long term rationale become we be involve in a hair trigger stand off with the Soviets to attack America be to risk blow up the world we connect national security to international security with about a seven minute time delay that be not we problem now they can kill three million in Chicago tomorrow and we do not go to the mattress with nuke that be the scary part the question be how do we reconnect American national security with global security to make the world a lot more comfortable and to embed and contextualize we employment of force around the planet what be happen since be that bifurcation I describe we talk about this go all the way back to the end of the Cold War let have a Department of War and a Department of something else some person say Hell 9 11 do it for you now we have get a home game and a away game laughter the Department of Homeland Security be a strategic feel good measure it be go to be the Department of Agriculture for the 21st century TSA thousand stand around laughter I support the war in Iraq he be a bad guy with multiple prior it be not like we have to find he actually kill somebody live to arrest he I know we would kick ass in the war with the Leviathan Force I know we would have a hard time with what follow but I know this organization do not change until it experience failure what do I mean by this two different force this be the hobbesian force I love this force I do not want to see it go that plus nuke rule out great power war this be the military the rest of the world want we to build it be why I travel all over the world talk to foreign military what do this mean it mean you have get to stop pretend you can do this two very disparate skill set with the same 19 year old switching back morning afternoon evening morning afternoon evening hand out aid shooting back hand out aid shooting back it be too much the 19 year old get tired from the switch ok laughter that force on the leave you can train a 19 year old to do that that force on the right be more like a 40 year old cop you need the experience what do this mean in term of operation the rule be go to be this that Sys Admin force be the force that never come home do most of you work you break out that Leviathan Force only every so often but here be the promise you make to the American public to you own person to the world you break out that Leviathan Force you promise you guarantee that you be go to mount one hell of a immediately follow on Sys Admin effort do not plan for the war unless you plan to win the peace applause other difference Leviathan traditional partner they all look like the Brits and they former colony laughter include we I would remind you the rest wide array of partner international organization non governmental organization private voluntary organization contractor you be not go to get away from that Leviathan Force it be all about joint operation between the military service we be do with that what we need to do be inter agency operation which frankly Condi Rice be in charge of and I be amazed nobody ask she that question when she be confirm I call the Leviathan Force you dad military I like they young male unmarried slightly piss off laughter I call the Sys Admin Force you mom military it be everything the man military hate gender balance much more old educate marry with child the force on the leave up or out the force on the right in and out the force on the left respects Posse Comitatus restriction on the use of force inside the U S the force on the right be go to obliterate it that be where the National Guard be go to be the force on the left be never come under the purview of the International Criminal Court Sys Admin Force have to different definition of network centricity one take down network one put they up and you have get to wage war here in such a way to facilitate that do we need a big budget do we need a draft to pull this off absolutely not I have be tell by the Revolution of Military Affairs crowd for year we can do it fast cheap small just as lethal I say Great I be go to take the Sys Admin budget out of you hide here be the large point you be go to build the Sys Admin Force inside the U S Military first but ultimately you be go to civilianize it probably two third Inter agency ize it internationalize it so yes it begin inside the Pentagon but over time it be go to cross that river laughter I have be to the mountain top I can see the future I may not live long enough to get you there but it be go to happen we be go to have a Department of something else between war and peace last slide who get custody of the kid this be where the Marines in the audience get kind of tense laughter and this be when they think about beat the crap out of I after the talk laughter read Max Boon this be the history of the marine small war small arm the Marines be like my West Highland Terrier they get up every morning they want to dig a hole and they want to kill something laughter I do not want my Marines hand out aid I want they to be Marines that be what keep the Sys Admin Force from be a pussy force it keep it from be the U N you shoot at this person the Marines be go to come over and kill you laughter applause Department of Navy strategic sub go this way surface combatant be over there and the news be they may actually be that small laughter I call it the Smart Dust Navy I tell young officer you may command 500 ship in you career bad news be they may not have anybody on they carrier go both way because they be a swing asset you will see the pattern airborne just like carrier Armor go this way here be the dirty secret of the Air Force you can win by bombing but you need lot of this guy on the ground to win the peace Shinseki be right with the argument air force strategic airlift go both way bomber fighter go over here Special Operations command down at Tampa trigger puller go this way Civil Affairs that bastard child come over here return to the Army the point about the trigger puller and Special Operations Command no off season this guy be always active they drop in do they business disappear see I now do not talk about it late laughter I be never here laughter the world be my playground laughter I want to keep trigger puller trigger happy I want the rule to be as loose as possible because when the thing get prevent in Chicago with the three million dead that pervert we political system beyond all recognition this be the guy who be go to kill they first so it be good off to have they make some mistake along the way than to see that Reserve component National Guard reserve overwhelmingly Sys Admin how be you go to get they to work for this force most fireman in this country do it for free this be not about money this be about be up front with this guy and gal last point intelligence community the muscle and the defense agency go this way what should be the CIA open analytical open source should come over here the information you need to do this be not secret it be not secret read that great piece in the New Yorker about how we echo boomer 19 to 25 over in Iraq teach each other how to do sy admin work over the internet in chat room they say Al Qaeda could be listen they say well Jesus they already know this stuff laughter take a gift in the left hand this be the sunglass that do not scare person simple stuff censor and transparency the overhead go in both direction thanks
