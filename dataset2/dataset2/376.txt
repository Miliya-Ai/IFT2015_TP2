theme and variation be one of that form that require a certain kind of intellectual activity because you be always compare the variation with the theme that you hold in you mind you might say that the theme be nature and everything that follow be a variation on the subject I be ask I guess about six year ago to do a series of painting that in some way would celebrate the birth of Piero della Francesca and it be very difficult for I to imagine how to paint picture that be base on Piero until I realize that I could look at Piero as nature that I would have the same attitude towards look at Piero della Francesca as I would if I be look out a window at a tree and that be enormously liberating to I perhaps it be not a very insightful observation but that really start I on a path to be able to do a kind of theme and variationsbase on a work by Piero in this case that remarkable painting that be in the Uffizi the Duke of Montefeltro who face he consort Battista once I realize that I could take some liberty with the subject I do the follow series of drawing that be the real Piero della Francesca one of the great portrait in human history and this I will just show this without comment it be just a series of variation on the head of the Duke of Montefeltro who be a great great figure in the Renaissance and probably the basis for Machiavelli the Prince he apparently lose a eye in battle which be why he be always show in profile and this be Battista and then I decide I could move they around a little bit so that for the first time in history they be face the same direction whoop pass each other and then a visitor from another painting by Piero this be from the resurrection of Christ as though the cast have just get of the set to have a chat and now four large panel this be upper left upper right low leave low right incidentally I have never understand the conflict between abstraction and naturalism since all painting be inherently abstract to begin with there do not seem to be a argument there on another subject laughter I be drive in the country one day with my wife and I see this sign and I say that be a fabulous piece of design and she say what be you talk about I say well it be so persuasive because the purpose of that sign be to get you into the garage and since most person be so suspicious of garage and know that they be go to be rip off they use the word reliable but everybody say they be reliable but reliable dutchman laughter fantastic because as soon as you hear the word dutchman which be a archaic word nobody call dutch person Dutchmen anymore but as soon as you hear Dutchman you get this picture of the kid with he finger in the dike prevent the thing from fall and flood Holland and so on and so the entire issue be detoxify by the use of Dutchman now if you think I be exaggerate at all in this all you have to do be substitute something else like Indonesian laughter or even French laughter now Swiss work but you know it be go to cost a lot of money laughter I be go to take you quickly through the actual process of do a poster I do a lot of work for the School of Visual Arts where I teach and the director of this school a remarkable man name Silas Rhodes often give you a piece of text and he say do something with this and so he do and this be the text in word as fashion the same rule will hold alike fantastic if too new or old be not the first by whom the new be try nor yet the last to lay the old aside I could make nothing of that and I really struggle with this one and the first thing I do which be sort of in the absence of another idea be say I will sort of write it out and make some word big and I will have some kind of design on the back somehow and I be hope as one often do to stumble into something so I take another crack at it you have get to keep it move and I xerox some word on piece of colored paper and I paste they down on a ugly board I think that something would come out of it like word rule fantastic new old first last Pope because it be by Alexander Pope but I sort of make a mess out of it and then I think I would repeat it in some way so it be legible so it be go nowhere sometimes in the middle of a resistant problem I write down thing that I know about it but you can see the beginning of a idea there because you can see the word new emerge from the old that be what happen there be a relationship between the old and the new the new emerge from the context of the old and then I do some variation of it but it still be not coalesce graphically at all I have this other version which have something interesting about it in term of be able to put it together in you mind from clue the W be clearly a w the n be clearly a n even though they be very fragmentary and there be not a lot of information in it then I get the word new and old and now I have regress back to a point where there seem to be no return laughter I be really desperate at this point and so I do something I be truthfully ashamed of which be that I take two drawing I have make for another purpose and I put they together it say dream at the top and I be go to do a thing I say well change the copy let it say something about dream and come to SVA and you will sort of fulfill you dream but to my credit I be so embarrassed about do that that I never submit this sketch and finally I arrive at the follow solution now it do not look terribly interesting but it do have something that distinguish it from a lot of other poster for one thing it transgress the idea of what a poster suppose to be which be to be understand and see immediately and not explain I remember hear all of you in the graphic art if you have to explain it it be not work and one day I wake up and I say well suppose that be not true laughter so here be what it say in my explanation at the bottom leave it say thought this poem be impossible Silas usually have a good touch with he choice of quotation this one generate no imagery at all I be now expose myself to my audience right which be something you never want to do professionally maybe the word can make the image without anything else happen what be the heart of this poem do not be trendy if you want to be serious be do the poster this way trendy in itself I guess one could reduce the idea further by suggest that the new emerge behind and through the old like this and then I show you a little drawing you see you remember that old thing I discard well I find a way to use it so there be that little alternative over there and I say not bad criticize myself but more didactic than visual maybe what want to be say be that old and the new be lock in a dialectical embrace a kind of dance where each define the other and then more self questioning be I be simple minded be this the kind of simple that look obvious or the kind that look profound there be a significant difference this could be embarrassing actually I realize fear of embarrassment drive I as much as any ambition do you think this sort of thing could really attract a student to the school laughter well I think there be two fresh thing here two fresh thing one be the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience and not to suggest that I be confident about what I be do and as you know you have to have a front I mean you have get to be confident if you do not believe in you work who else be go to believe in it so that be one thing to introduce the idea of doubt into graphic that can be a big contribution the other thing be to actually give you two solution for the price of one you get the big one and if you do not like that how about the little one laughter and that too be a relatively new idea and here be just a series of experiment where I ask the question of do a poster have to be square now this be a little illusion that poster be not fold it be not fold that be a photograph and it be cut on the diagonal same cheap trick in the upper left hand corner and here a very peculiar poster because simply because of use the isometric perspective in the computer it will not sit still in the space at time it seem to be wide at the back than the front and then it shift and if you sit here long enough it will float off the page into the audience but we do not have time laughter and then a experiment a little bit about the nature of perspective where the outside shape be determine by the peculiarity of perspective but the shape of the bottle which be identical to the outside shape be see frontally and another piece for the art director club be Anna Rees cast long shadow this be another poster from the School of Visual Arts there be 10 artist invite to participate in it and it be one of that thing where it be extremely competitive and I do not want to be embarrassed so I work very hard on this the idea be and it be a brilliant idea be to have 10 poster distribute throughout the city subway system so every time you get on the subway you would be pass a different poster all of which have a different idea of what art be but I be absolutely stick on the idea of art be and try to determine what art be but then I give up and I say well art be whatever and as soon as I say that I discover that the word hat be hide in the word whatever and that lead I to the inevitable conclusion but then again it be on my list of didactic poster my intent be to have a literary accompaniment that explain the poster in case you do not get it laughter now this say note to the viewer I think I might use a visual cliche of we time Magritte everyman to express the idea that art be mystery continuity and history I be also convince that in a age of computer manipulation surrealism have become banal a shadow of its former self the phrase art be whatever express the current inclusiveness that surround art make a sort of it be not what you do it be the way that you do it notion the shadow of Magritte fall across the central part of the poster a poetic event that occur as the shadow man isolate the word hat hide in the word whatever the four hat show in the poster suggest how art might be define as a thing itself the worth of the thing the shadow of the thing and the shape of the thing whatever applause ok applause and the one that I do not submit which I still like I want to use the same phrase there be wonderful experiment by Bruno Munari on letterform some year ago sort of see how far you could go and still be able to read they and that idea stick in my head but then I take the piece that I have take off and put they at the bottom and of course that be the remains and they be so label but what really happen be that you read it as art be whatever remain thank you applause
