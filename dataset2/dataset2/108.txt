I be really scared I do not think we be go to make it probably by now most of you have see Al Gore amazing talk shortly after I see that we have some friend over for dinner with the family the conversation turn to global warming and everybody agree there be a real problem we have get a climate crisis so we go around the table to talk about what we should do the conversation come to my 15 year old daughter Mary she say I agree with everything that be be say I be scared and I be angry and then she turn to I and say Dad you generation create this problem you would well fix it wow all the conversation stop all the eye turn to I laughter I do not know what to say Kleiner second law be there be a time when panic be the appropriate response laughter and we have reach that time we can not afford to underestimate this problem if we face irreversible and catastrophic consequence we must act and we must act decisively I have get to tell you for I everything change that evening and so my partner and I we set off on this mission to learn more to try to do much more so we mobilize we get on airplane we go to Brazil we go to China and to India to Bentonville Arkansas to Washington D C and to Sacramento and so what I would like to do now be to tell you about what we have learn in that journey because the more we learn the more concerned we grow you know my partner at Kleiner and I be compulsive networker and so when we see a big problem or a opportunity like avian flu or personalize medicine we just get together the smart person we know for this climate crisis we assemble a network really of superstar from policy activist to scientist and entrepreneur and business leader fifty or so of they and so I want to tell you about what we have learn in do that and four lesson I have learn in the last year the first lesson be that company be really powerful and that matter a lot this be a story about how Wal Mart go green and what that mean two year ago the CEO Lee Scott believe that green be the next big thing and so Wal Mart make go green a top priority they commit that they be go to take they exist store and reduce they energy consumption by 20 percent and they new store by 30 percent and do all that in seven year the three big use of energy in a store be heat and air conditioning then light and then refrigeration so look what they do they paint the roof of all they store white they put smart skylight through they store so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demand and third they put the refrigerate goods behind close door with lead lighting I mean why would you try to refrigerate a whole store this be really simple smart solution base on exist technology why do Wal Mart matter well it be massive they be the large private employer in America they be the large private user of electricity they have the second large vehicle fleet on the road and they have one of the world most amazing supply chain 60 000 supplier if Wal Mart be a country it would be the sixth large trading partner with China and maybe most important they have a big effect on other company when Wal Mart declare it be go to go green and be profitable it have a powerful impact on other great institution so let I tell you this when Wal Mart achieve 20 percent energy reduction that be go to be a very big deal but I be afraid it be not enough we need Wal Mart and every other company to do the same the second thing that we learn be that individual matter and they matter enormously I have get another Wal Mart story for you ok Wal Mart have over 125 million U S customer that be a third of the U S population 65 million compact fluorescent light bulb be sell last year and Wal Mart have commit they be go to sell another 100 million light bulb in the coming year but it be not easy consumer do not really like this light bulb the light kind of funny they will not dim take a while for they to start up but the pay off be really enormous 100 million compact fluorescent light bulb mean that we will save 600 million dollar in energy bill and 20 million ton of co2 every year year in and year out it do seem really hard to get consumer to do the right thing it be stupid that we use two ton of steel glass and plastic to haul we sorry self to the shopping mall it be stupid that we put water in plastic bottle in Fiji and ship it here laughter it be hard to change consumer behavior because consumer do not know how much this stuff cost do you know do you know how much co2 you generate to drive here or fly here I do not know and I should that of we who care about all this would act good if we know what the real cost be but as long as we pretend that co2 be free as long as this use be nearly invisible how can we expect change I be really afraid because I think the kind of change we can reasonably expect from individual be go to be clearly not enough the third lesson we learn be that policy matter it really matter in fact policy be paramount I have get a behind the scene story for you about that green tech network I describe at the end of we first meet we get together to talk about what the action item would be how we have follow up and Bob Epstein raise a hand he stand up you know Bob that Berkeley techie type who start Sybase Well Bob say the most important thing we could do right now be to make it clear in Sacramento California that we need a market base system of mandate that be go to cap and reduce greenhouse gas in California it be necessary and just as important it be good for the California economy so eight of we go to Sacramento in August and we meet with the seven undecided legislator and we lobby for ab32 you know what six of that seven vote yes in favor of the bill so it pass and it pass by a vote of 47 to 32 applause please thank you I think it be the most important legislation of 2006 why because California be the first state in this country to mandate 25 percent reduction of greenhouse gas by 2020 and the result of that be we be go to generate 83 000 new job four billion dollar a year in annual income and reduce the co2 emission by 174 million ton a year California emit only seven percent of U S co2 emission it be only a percent and a half of the country co2 emission it be a great start but I have get to tell you where I start I be really afraid in fact I be certain California be not enough here be a story about national policy that we could all learn from you know Tom Friedman say if you do not go you do not know well we go to Brazil to meet Dr Jose Goldemberg he be the father of the ethanol revolution he tell we that Brazil government mandate that every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol and they mandate that they new vehicle would be flex fuel compatible right they have run ethanol or ordinary gasoline and so here be what be happen in Brazil they now have 29 000 ethanol pump this versus 700 in the U S and a paltry two in California and in three year they new car fleet have go from four percent to 85 percent flex fuel compare that to the U S five percent be flex fuel and you know what most consumer who have they do not even know it so what be happen in Brazil be they have replace 40 percent of the gasoline consume by they automotive fleet with ethanol that be 59 billion dollar since 1975 that they do not ship to the Middle East it be create a million job inside that country and it be save 32 million ton of co2 it be really substantial that be 10 percent of the co2 emission across they entire country but Brazil only 1 3 percent of the world co2 emission so Brazil ethanol miracle I be really afraid be not enough in fact I be afraid all of the good policy we have be not go to be enough the fourth and final lesson we have learn be about the potential of radical innovation so I want to tell you about a tragic problem and a breakthrough technology every year a million and a half person die of a completely preventable disease that be malaria 6 000 person a day all for want of two dollar worth of medication that we can buy at the corner drugstore well two dollar two dollar be too much for Africa so a team of Berkeley researcher with 15 million dollar from the Gates Foundation be engineer design a radical new way to make the key ingredient call artemisinin and they be go to make that drug 10 time cheap and in do so they will save a million life at least a million live a year a million life they breakthrough technology be synthetic biology this leverage million of year of evolution by redesign bug to make really useful product now what you do be you get inside the microbe you change its metabolic pathway and you end up with a live chemical factory now you may ask John what have this get to go with green and with climate crisis well I will tell you a lot we have now form a company call Amyris and this technology that they be use can be use to make good biofuel do not let I skip over that Better biofuel be a really big deal that mean we can precisely engineer the molecule in the fuel chain and optimize they along the way so if all go well they be go to have designer bug in warm vat that be eat and digest sugar to excrete good biofuel I guess that be good live through bug Alan Kay be famous for say the good way to predict the future be to invent it and of course at Kleiner we kind of apologize and say the second good way be to finance it and that be why we be invest 200 million dollar in a wide range of really disruptive new technology for innovation in green technology and we be encourage other to do it as well we be talk a lot about this in 2005 there be 600 million dollar invest in new technology of the sort you see here it double in 2006 to 1 2 billion dollar but I be really afraid we need much much more for reference fact one Exxon revenue in 2005 be a billion dollar a day do you know they only invest 0 2 percent of revenue in r d second fact the President new budget for renewable energy be barely a billion dollar in total less than one day of Exxon revenue third fact I bet you do not know that there be enough energy in hot rock under the country to supply America energy need for the next thousand year and the federal budget call for a measly 20 million dollar of r d in geothermal energy it be almost criminal that we be not invest more in energy research in this country and I be really afraid that it be absolutely not enough so in a year worth of learning we find a bunch of surprise who would have think that a mass retailer could make money by go green who would have think that a database entrepreneur could transform California with legislation who would have think that the ethanol biofuel miracle would come from a develop country in South America and who would have think that scientist try to cure malaria could come up with breakthrough in biofuel and who would have think that all that be not enough not enough to stabilize the climate not enough to keep the ice in Greenland from crash into the ocean the scientist tell we and they be only guess that we have get to reduce greenhouse gas emission by one half and do it as fast as possible now we may have the political will to do this in the U S but I have get to tell you we have get only one atmosphere and so somehow we be go to have to find the political will to do this all around the world the wild card in this deck be China to size the problem China co2 emission today be 3 3 gigaton the U S be 5 8 business as usual means we will have 23 gigaton from China by 2050 that be about as much co2 as there be in the whole world and if it be business as usual we be go out of business when I be in Davos China Mayor of Dalian be press about they co2 strategy and he say the follow you know American use seven time the co2 per capita as Chinese then he ask why should China sacrifice we growth so that the West can continue to be profligate and stupid do anybody here have a answer for he I do not we have get to make this economic so that all person and all nation make the right outcome the profitable outcome and therefore the likely outcome energy a six trillion dollar business worldwide it be the mother of all market you remember that internet well I will tell you what Green technology go green be big than the internet it could be the big economic opportunity of the 21st century moreover if we succeed it be go to be the most important transformation for life on the planet since as Bill Joy say we go from methane to oxygen in the atmosphere now here be the hard question if the trajectory of all the world company and individual and policy and innovation be not go to be enough what be we go to do I do not know everyone here care about change the world and have make a difference in that one way or another so we call to action my call to you be for you to make go green you next big thing you gig what can you do you can personally get carbon neutral go to ClimateCrisis org or CarbonCalculator com and buy carbon credit you could join other leader in mandate lobby for mandate cap and trade in U S greenhouse gas reduction there be six bill right now in Congress let get one of they pass and the most important thing you can do I think be to use you personal power and you Rolodex to lead you business you institution in go green do it like Wal Mart get it to go green for its customer and its supplier and for itself really think outside the box can you imagine what it would be like if Amazon or eBay or Google or Microsoft or Apple really go green and you cause that to happen it could be big than Wal Mart I can not wait to see what we tedster do about this crisis and I really really hope that we multiply all of we energy all of we talent and all of we influence to solve this problem because if we do I can look forward to the conversation I be go to have with my daughter in 20 year applause
