I work with a species call Bonobo and I be happy most of the time because I think this be the happy species on the planet it be kind of a well keep secret this species live only in the Congo and they be not in too many zoo because of they sexual behavior they sexual behavior be too human like for most of we to be comfortable with laughter but laughter actually we have a lot to learn from they because they be a very egalitarian society and they be a very empathetic society and sexual behavior be not confine to one aspect of they life that they sort of set aside it permeate they entire life and it be use for communication and it be use for conflict resolution and I think perhaps somewhere in we history we sort of divide we life up into lot of part we divide we world up with lot of category and so everything sort of have a place that it have to fit but I do not think that we be that way initially there be many person who think that the animal world be hard wired and that there be something very very special about man maybe it be he ability to have causal thought maybe it be something special in he brain that allow he to have language maybe it be something special in he brain that allow he to make tool or to have mathematics well I do not know there be Tasmanians who be discover around the 1600 and they have no fire they have no stone tool to we knowledge they have no music so when you compare they to the Bonobo the Bonobo be a little hairy he do not stand quite as upright but there be a lot of similarity and I think that as we look at culture we kind of come to understand how we get to where we be and I do not really think it be in we biology I think we have attribute it to we biology but I do not really think it be there so what I want to do now be introduce you to a species call the Bonobo this be Kanzi he be a Bonobo Right now he be in a forest in Georgia he mother originally come from a forest in Africa and she come to we when she be just at puberty about six or seven year of age now this show a bonobo on you right and a chimpanzee on you leave clearly the chimpanzee have a little bit hard time of walk the Bonobo although short than we and they arm still long be more upright just as we be this show the bonobo compare to a australopithecine like Lucy as you can see there be not a lot of difference between the way a Bonobo walk and the way a early australopithecine would have walk as they turn toward we you will see that the pelvic area of early australopithecine be a little flat and do not have to rotate quite so much from side to side so the the bipedal gait be a little easy and now we see all four video narrator the wild Bonobo live in central Africa in the jungle encircle by the Congo River Canopied tree as tall as 40 meter 130 foot grow densely in the area it be a Japanese scientist who first undertake serious field study of the Bonobo almost three decade ago Bonobos be build slightly small than the chimpanzee slim bodied bonobo be by nature very gentle creature long and careful study have report many new finding on they one discovery be that wild Bonobos often walk bidpedally what be more they be able to walk upright for long distance Susan Savage Rumbaugh video let go say hello to Austin first and then go to the a frame ss this be Kanzi and I in the forest none of the thing you will see in this particular video be train none of they be trick they all happen to be capture on film spontaneously by NHK of Japan we have eight Bonobos Video look at all this stuff that be here for we campfire ss a entire family at we research centre video you go to help get some stick good we need more stick too I have a light in my pocket if you need one that be a wasp nest you can get it out I hope I have a light you can use the light to start the fire ss so Kanzi be very interested in fire he do not do it yet without a light but I think if he see someone do it he might be able to do make a fire without a light he be learn about how to keep a fire go he be learn the use for a fire just by watch what we do with fire laughter this be a smile on the face of a Bonobo this be happy vocalization Video you be happy you be very happy about this part you have get to put some water on the fire you see the water good job ss forget to zip up the back half of he backpack but he like to carry thing from place to place Video Austin I hear you say Austin SS he talk to other Bonobos at the lab long distance far than we can hear this be he sister this be she first time to try to drive a golf cart video goodbye laughter ss she be get the pedal down but not the wheel she switch from reverse to forward and she hold onto the wheel rather than turn it laughter like we she know that that individual in the mirror be she music video Narrator by raise Bonobos in a culture that be both Bonobo and human and document they development across two decade scientist be explore how cultural force laughter may have operate during human evolution he name be Nyota it mean star in Swahili Music Panbanisha be try to give Nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors in the wild the parent Bonobo be know to groom its offspring here Panbanisha use scissors instead of she hand to groom Nyota very impressive subtle maneuvering of the hand be require to perform delicate task like this Nyota try to imitate Panbanisha by use the scissors himself realize that Nyota might get hurt Panbanisha like any human mother carefully tug to get the scissors back he can now cut through tough animal hide ss Kanzi learn to make stone tool Video Kanzi now make he tool just as we ancestor may have make they two and a half million year ago by hold the rock in both hand to strike one against the other he have learn that by use both hand and aim he glance blow he can make much large sharp flake Kanzi choose a flake he think be sharp enough the tough hide be difficult to cut even with a knife the rock that Kanzi be use be extremely hard and ideal for stone tool make but difficult to handle require great skill Kanzi rock be from Gona Ethiopia and be identical to that use by we African ancestor two and a half million year ago this be the rock Kanzi use and this be the flake he make the flat sharp edge be like knife blade compare they to the tool we ancestor use they bear a striking resemblance to Kanzi Panbanisha be longing to go for a walk in the wood she keep stare out the window ss this be let I show you something we do not think they would do video for several day now Panbanisha have not be outside ss I normally talk about language video then Panbanisha do something unexpected ss but since I be advise not to do what I normally do I have not tell you that this ape have language it be a geometric language video she take a piece of chalk and begin write something on the floor what be she write SS she be also say the name of that with she voice video now she come up to Dr Sue and start write again SS this be she symbol on she keyboard music they speak when she touch they video Panbanisha be communicate to Dr Sue where she want to go a frame represent a hut in the wood compare the chalk write with the lexigram on the keyboard Panbanisha begin write the lexigram on the forest floor ss video very nice beautiful Panbanisha SS at first we do not really realize what she be do until we stand back and look at it and rotate it Video this lexigram also refer to a place in the wood the curved line be very similar to the lexigram the next symbol Panbanisha write represent collar it indicate the collar that Panbanisha must wear when she go out SS that be a institutional requirement video this symbol be not as clear as the other but one can see Panbanisha be try to produce a curved line and several straight line researcher begin to record what Panbanisha say by write lexigram on the floor with chalk Panbanisha watch soon she begin to write as well the Bonobo ability have stun scientist around the world how do they develop SS video we find that the most important thing for permit Bonobos to acquire language be not to teach they it be simply to use language around they because the drive force in language acquisition be to understand what other that be important to you be say to you once you have that capacity the ability to produce language come rather naturally and rather freely so we want to create a environment in which Bonobos like all of the individual with whom they be interact we want to create a environment in which they have fun and a environment in which the other be meaningful individual for they Narrator this environment bring out unexpected potential in Kanzi and Panbanisha Panbanisha be enjoy play she harmonica until Nyota now one year old steal it then he peer eagerly into he mother mouth be he look for where the sound come from Dr Sue think it be important to allow such curiosity to flourish this time Panbanisha be play the electric piano she be not force to learn the piano she see a researcher play the instrument and take a interest researcher go ahead go ahead I be listen do that real fast part that you do yeah that part Narrator Kanzi play the xylophone use both hand he enthusiastically accompany Dr Sue singing Kanzi and Panbanisha be stimulate by this fun fill environment which promote the emergence of this cultural capability laughter researcher ok now get the monster get they take the cherry too now watch out stay away from they now now you can chase they again Time to chase they now you have to stay away get away run away run now we can chase they again go get they oh no good Kanzi very good thank you so much Narrator none of we Bonobo or human can possibly even imagine SS so we have a bi species environment we call it a panhomoculture we be learn how to become like they we be learn how to communicate with they in really high pitch tone we be learn that they probably have a language in the wild and they be learn to become like we because we believe that it be not biology it be culture so we be share tool and technology and language with another species thank you
