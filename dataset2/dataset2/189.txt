so what I would like to talk about be something that be very dear to Kahn heart which be how do we discover what be really particular about a project how do you discover the uniqueness of a project as unique as a person because it seem to I that find this uniqueness have to do with deal with the whole force of globalization that the particular be central to find the uniqueness of place and the uniqueness of a program in a building and so I will take you to Wichita Kansas where I be ask some year ago to do a science museum on a site right downtown by the river and I think the secret of the site be to make the building of the river part of the river unfortunately though the site be separate from the river by McLean Boulevard so I suggest let reroute McLean and that give birth instantly to friend of McLean Boulevard laughter and it take six month to reroute it the first image I show the building committee be this astronomic observatory of Jantar Mantar in Jaipur because I talk about what make a build a building of science and it seem to I that this structure complex rich and yet totally rational it be a instrument have something to do with science and somehow a building for science should be different and unique and speak of that and so my first sketch after I leave be to say let cut the channel and make a island and make a island building and I get all excited and come back and they sort of look at I in dismay and say a island this use to be a island Ackerman Island and we fill in the channel during the Depression to create job laughter and so the process begin and they say you can not put it all on a island some of it have to be on the mainland because we do not want to turn we back to the community and there emerge a design the gallery sort of form a island and you could walk through they or on the roof and there be all kind of exciting feature you could come in through the landside building walk through the gallery into playground in the landscape if you be cheap you could walk on top of a bridge to the roof peek in the exhibit and then get totally seduce come back and pay the five dollar admission laughter and the client be happy well sort of happy because we be four million dollar over the budget but essentially happy but I be still troubled and I be trouble because I feel this be capricious it be complex but there be something capricious about its complexity it be what I would say compositional complexity and I feel that if I have to fulfill what I talk about a building for science there have to be some kind of a generate idea some kind of a generate geometry and this give birth to the idea of have toroidal generate geometry one with its center deep in the earth for the landside building and a toroid with its center in the sky for the island building a toroid for that who do not know be the surface of a doughnut or for some of we a bagel and out of this idea start spin off many many kind of variation of different plan and possibility and then the plan itself evolve in relationship to the exhibit and you see the intersection of the plan with the toroidal geometry and finally the building this be the model and when there be complaint about budget I say well it be worth do the island because you get twice for you money reflection and here be the building as it open with a channel overlook downtown and as see from downtown and the bike route be go right through the building so that travel the river would see the exhibit and be draw to the building the toroidal geometry make for a very efficient building every beam in this building be the same radius all laminate wood every wall every concrete wall be resist the stress and support the building every piece of the building work this be the gallery with the light come in through the skylight and at night and on open day go back to 1976 applause in 1976 I be ask to design a child memorial museum in a Holocaust museum in Yad Vashem in Jerusalem which you see here the campus I be ask to do a building and I be give all the artifact of clothing and drawing and I feel very troubled I work on it for month and I could not deal with it because I feel person be come out of the historic museum they be totally saturate with information and to see yet another museum with information it would make they just unable to digest and so I make a counter proposal I say no building there be a cave on the site we tunnel into the hill descend through the rock into a underground chamber there be a anteroom with photograph of child who perish and then you come into a large space there be a single candle flicker in the center by a arrangement of reflective glass it reflect into infinity in all direction you walk through the space a voice read the name age and place of birth of the child this voice do not repeat for six month and then you descend to light and to the north and to life well they say person will not understand they will think it be a discotheque you can not do that and they shelve the project and it sit there for 10 year and then one day Abe Spiegel from Los Angeles who have lose he three year old son at Auschwitz come see the model write the check and it get build 10 year later so many year after that in 1998 I be on one of my monthly trip to Jerusalem and I get a call from the foreign ministry say we have get the Chief Minister of the Punjab here he be on a state visit we take he on a visit to Yad Vashem we take he to the child memorial he be extremely move he be demand to meet the architect could you come down and meet he in Tel Aviv and I go down and Chief Minister Badal say to I we Sikhs have suffer a great deal as you have Jews I be very move by what I see today we be go to build we national museum to tell the story of we person we be about to embark on that I would like you to come and design it and so you know it be one of that thing that you do not take too seriously but two week later I be in this little town Anandpur Sahib outside Chandigarh the capital of the Punjab and the temple and also next to it the fortress that the last guru of the Sikhs Guru Gobind die in as he write the Khalsa which be they holy scripture and I get to work and they take I somewhere down there nine kilometer away from the town and the temple and say that be where we have choose the location and I say this just do not make any sense the pilgrim come here by the hundred of thousand they be not go to get in truck and bus and go down there let get back to the town and walk to the site and I recommend they do it right there on that hill and this hill and bridge all the way into the town and as thing be a little easy in India the site be purchase within a week and we be work laughter and my proposal be to split the museum into two the permanent exhibit at one end the auditorium library and change exhibition on the other to flood the valley into a series of water garden and to link it all to the fort and to the downtown and the structure rise from the sand cliff they be build in concrete and sandstone the roof be stainless steel they be face south and reflect light towards the temple itself pedestrian crisscross from one side to the other and as you come from the north it be all masonry grow out of the sand cliff as you come from the Himalayas and evoke the tradition of the fortress and then I go away for four month and there be go to be groundbreaking and I come back and lo and behold the little model I have leave behind have be build ten time big for public display on site and the bridge be build laughter within the work drawing and half a million person gather for the celebration you can see they on the site itself as the foundation be begin I be rename Safdie Singh and there it be under construction there be 1 800 worker at work and it will be finish in two year back to Yad Vashem three year ago after all this episode begin Yad Vashem decide to rebuild completely the historic museum because now Washington be build the Holocaust Museum in Washington and that museum be so much more comprehensive in term of information and Yad Vashem need to deal with three million visitor a year at this point they say let rebuild the museum but of course the Sikhs might give you a job on a platter the Jews make it hard international competition phase one phase two phase three laughter and again I feel kind of uncomfortable with the notion that a build the size of the Washington building 50 000 square foot will sit on that fragile hill and that we will go into gallery room with door and sort of familiar room to tell the story of the Holocaust and I propose that we cut through the mountain that be my first sketch just cut the whole museum through the mountain enter from one side of the mountain come out on the other side of the mountain and then bring light through the mountain into the chamber and here you see the model a reception building and some underground parking you cross a bridge you enter this triangular room 60 foot high which cut right into the hill and extend right through as you go towards the north and all of it then all the gallery be underground and you see the opening for the light and at night just one line of light cut through the mountain which be a skylight on top of that triangle and all the gallery as you move through they and so on be below grade and there be chamber carve in the rock concrete wall stone the natural rock when possible with the light shaft this be actually a Spanish quarry which sort of inspire the kind of space that this gallery could be and then come towards the north it open up it burst out of the mountain into again a view of light and of the city and of the Jerusalem hill I would like to conclude with a project I have be work on for two month it be the headquarters for the Institute of Peace in Washington the U S Institute of Peace The site choose be across from the Lincoln Memorial you see it there directly on the Mall it be the last building on the Mall on access of the Roosevelt Bridge that come in from Virginia that too be a competition and it be something I be just begin to work on but one recognize the kind of uniqueness of the site if it be to be anywhere in Washington it would be a office build a conference center a place for negotiate peace and so on all of which the building be but by virtue of the choice of put it on the Mall and by the Lincoln Memorial this become the structure that be the symbol of peace on the Mall and that be a lot of heat to deal with the first sketch recognize that the building be many space space where research go on conference center a public building because it will be a museum devote to peacemaking and this be the drawing that we submit for the competition the plan show the space which radiate outwards from the entry you see the structure as in the sequence of structure on the Mall very transparent and invite and look in and then as you enter it again look in all direction towards the city and what I feel about that building be that it really be a building that have to do with a lightness of be to quote Kundera that it have to do with whiteness it have to do with a certain dynamic quality and it have to do with optimism and this be where it be it be sort of evolve study for the structure of the roof which demand maybe new material how to make it white how to make it translucent how to make it glow how to make it not capricious and here study in three dimension how to give some kind again of order a structure not something you feel you could just change because you stop the design of that particular process and so it go I would like to conclude by say something applause I would like to conclude by relate all of what I have say to the term beauty and I know it be not a fashionable term this day and certainly not fashionable in the discourse of architectural school but it seem to I that all this in one way or the other be a search for beauty beauty in the most profound sense of fit I have a quote that I like by a morphologist 1917 Theodore Cook who say Beauty connote humanity we call a natural object beautiful because we see that its form express fitness the perfect fulfillment of function well I would have say the perfect fulfillment of purpose nevertheless beauty as the kind of fit something that tell we that all the force that have to do with we natural environment have be fulfil and we human environment for that twenty year ago in a conference Richard and I be at together I write a poem which seem to I to still hold for I today he who seek truth shall find beauty he who seek beauty shall find vanity he who seek order shall find gratification he who seek gratification shall be disappointed he who consider himself the servant of he fellow being shall find the joy of self expression he who seek self expression shall fall into the pit of arrogance arrogance be incompatible with nature through nature the nature of the universe and the nature of man we shall seek truth if we seek truth we shall find beauty thank you very much applause
