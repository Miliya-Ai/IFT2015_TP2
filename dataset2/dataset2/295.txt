a year ago I speak to you about a book that I be just in the process of complete that have come out in the interim and I would like to talk to you today about some of the controversy that that book inspire the book be call the blank Slate base on the popular idea that the human mind be a blank slate and that all of its structure come from socialization culture parenting experience the blank slate be a influential idea in the 20th century here be a few quote indicate that Man have no nature from the historian Jose Ortega y Gasset Man have no instinct from the anthropologist Ashley Montagu the human brain be capable of a full range of behavior and predispose to none from the late scientist Stephen Jay Gould there be a number of reason to doubt that the human mind be a blank slate and some of they just come from common sense as many person have tell I over the year anyone who be have more than one child know that kid come into the world with certain temperament and talent it do not all come from the outside oh and anyone who have both a child and a house pet have surely notice that the child expose to speech will acquire a human language whereas the house pet will not presumably because of some innate different between they and anyone who be ever be in a heterosexual relationship know that the mind of man and the mind of woman be not indistinguishable there be also I think increase result from the scientific study of human that indeed we be not bear blank slate one of they from anthropology be the study of human universal if you have ever take anthropology you know that it be a kind of a occupational pleasure of anthropologist to show how exotic other culture can be and that there be place out there where supposedly everything be the opposite to the way it be here but if you instead look at what be common to the world culture you find that there be a enormously rich set of behavior and emotion and way of construe the world that can be find in all of the world 6 000 odd culture the anthropologist Donald Brown have try to list they all and they range from aesthetics affection and age status all the way down to wean weapon weather attempt to control the color white and a worldview also genetics and neuroscience be increasingly show that the brain be intricately structure this be a recent study by the neurobiologist Paul Thompson and he colleague in which they use mri measure the distribution of gray matter that be the outer layer of the cortex in a large sample of pair of person they code correlation in the thickness of gray matter in different part of the brain use a false color scheme in which no difference be code as purple and any color other than purple indicate a statistically significant correlation well this be what happen when you pair person up at random by definition two person pick at random can not have correlation in the distribution of gray matter in the cortex this be what happen in person who share half of they dna fraternal twin and as you can see large amount of the brain be not purple show that if one person have a thick bit of cortex in that region so do he fraternal twin and here be what happen if you get a pair of person who share all they dna namely clone or identical twin and you can see huge area of cortex where there be massive correlation in the distribution of gray matter now this be not just difference in anatomy like the shape of you ear lobe but they have consequence in thought and behavior that be well illustrate in this famous cartoon by Charles Addams separate at birth the Mallifert twin meet accidentally as you can see there be two inventor with identical contraption in they lap meeting in the waiting room of a patent attorney now the cartoon be not such a exaggeration because study of identical twin who be separate at birth and then test in adulthood show that they have astonishing similarity and this happen in every pair of identical twin separate at birth ever study but much less so with fraternal twin separate at birth my favorite example be a pair of twin one of whom be bring up as a catholic in a Nazi family in Germany the other bring up in a Jewish family in Trinidad when they walk into the lab in Minnesota they be wear identical navy blue shirt with epaulette both of they like to dip butter toast in coffee both of they keep rubber band around they wrist both of they flush the toilet before use it as well as after and both of they like to surprise person by sneeze in crowded elevator to watch they jump now the story might seem to good to be true but when you administer battery of psychological test you get the same result namely identical twin separate at birth show quite astonishing similarity now give both the common sense and scientific datum call the doctrine of the blank slate into question why should it have be such a appealing notion well there be a number of political reason why person have find it congenial the foremost be that if we be blank slate then by definition we be equal because zero equal zero equal zero but if something be write on the slate then some person could have more of it than other and accord to this line of think that would justify discrimination and inequality another political fear of human nature be that if we be blank slate we can perfect mankind the age old dream of the perfectibility of we species through social engineering whereas if we be bear with certain instinct then perhaps some of they might condemn we to selfishness prejudice and violence well in the book I argue that this be in fact non sequiturs and just to make a long story short first of all the concept of fairness be not the same as the concept of sameness and so when Thomas Jefferson write in the declaration of Independence we hold this truth to be self evident that all man be create equal he do not mean we hold this truth to be self evident that all man be clone rather that all man be equal in term of they right and that every person ought to be treat as a individual and not prejudge by the statistics of particular group that they may belong to also even if we be bear with certain ignoble motive they do not automatically lead to ignoble behavior that be because the human mind be a complex system with many part and some of they can inhibit other for example there be excellent reason to believe that virtually all human be bear with a moral sense and that we have cognitive ability that allow we to profit from the lesson of history so even if person do have impulse towards selfishness or greed that be not the only thing in the skull and there be other part of the mind that can counteract they in the book I go over controversy such as this one and a number of other hot button hot zone chernobyl third rail and so on include the art clone crime free will education evolution gender difference God homosexuality infanticide inequality Marxism morality Nazism parenting politics race rape religion resource depletion social engineering technological risk and war and needless to say there be certain risk in take on this subject when I write a first draft of the book I circulate it to a number of colleague for comment and here be some of the reaction that I get well get a security camera for you house do not expect to get any more award job offer or position in scholarly society tell you publisher not to list you hometown in you author bio do you have tenure laughter well the book come out in October and nothing terrible have happen I I like there be indeed reason to be nervous and there be moment in which I do feel nervous know the history of what have happen to person who have take controversial stand or discover disquieting finding in the behavioral science there be many case some of which I talk about in the book of person who have be slander call Nazi physically assault threaten with criminal prosecution for stumble across or argue about controversial finding and you never know when you be go to come across one of this booby trap my favorite example be a pair of psychologist who do research on left hander and publish some datum show that left hander be on average more susceptible to disease more prone to accident and have a short lifespan it be not clear by the way since then whether that be a accurate generalization but the datum at the time seem to support that well pretty soon they be barrage with enrage letter death threat ban on the topic in a number of scientific journal come from irate left hander and they advocate and they be literally afraid to open they mail because of the venom and vituperation that they have inadvertently inspire well the night be young but the book have be out for half a year and nothing terrible have happen none of the dire professional consequence have take place I have not be exile from the city of Cambridge but what I want to talk about be two of this hot button that have arouse the strong response in the 80 odd review that the blank Slate have receive I will just put that list up for a few second and see if you can guess which two I would estimate that probably two of this topic inspire probably 90 percent of the reaction in the various review and radio interview it be not violence and war it be not race it be not gender it be not Marxism it be not Nazism they be the art and parenting laughter so let I tell you what arouse such irate response and I will let you decide if whether they the claim be really that outrageous let I start with the art I note that among the long list of human universal that I present a few slide ago be art there be no society ever discover in the remote corner of the world that have not have something that we would consider the art visual art decoration of surface and body appear to be a human universal the telling of story music dance poetry find in all culture and many of the motif and theme that give we pleasure in the art can be find in all human society a preference for symmetrical form the use of repetition and variation even thing as specific as the fact that in poetry all over the world you have line that be very close to three second long separate by pause now on the other hand in the second half of the 20th century the art be frequently say to be in decline and I have a collection probably 10 or 15 headline from highbrow magazine deplore the fact that the art be in decline in we time I will give you a couple of representative quote we can assert with some confidence that we own period be one of decline that the standard of culture be low than they be 50 year ago and that the evidence of this decline be visible in every department of human activity that be a quote from T S Eliot a little more than 50 year ago and a more recent one the possibility of sustain high culture in we time be become increase problematical Serious book store be lose they franchise nonprofit theater be survive primarily by commercialize they repertory symphony orchestra be dilute they program public television be increase its dependence on rerun of British sitcom classical radio station be dwindle museum be resort to blockbuster show dance be die that be from Robert Brustein the famous drama critic and director in the New Republic about five year ago well in fact the art be not in decline I do not think this will as a surprise to anyone in this room but by any standard they have never be flourish to a great extent there be of course entirely new art form and new media many of which you have hear over this few day by any economic standard the demand for art of all form be skyrocket as you can tell from the price of opera ticket by the number of book sell by the number of book publish the number of musical title release the number of new album and so on the only grain of truth to this complaint that the art be in decline come from three sphere one of they be in elite art since the 1930 say the kind of work perform by major symphony orchestra where most of the repertory be before 1930 or the work show in major gallery and prestigious museum in literary criticism and analysis probably 40 or 50 year ago literary critic be a kind of cultural hero now they be kind of a national joke and the humanities and art program in the university which by many measure indeed be in decline student be stay away in drove university be disinvest in the art and humanities well here be a diagnosis they do not ask I but by they own admission they need all the help that they can get and I would like to suggest that it be not a coincidence that this suppose decline in the elite art and criticism occur in the same point in history in which there be a widespread denial of human nature a famous quotation can be find if you look on the web you can find it in literally score of English core syllabus in or about December 1910 human nature change a paraphrase of a quote by Virginia Woolf and there be some debate as to what she actually mean by that but it be very clear look at this syllabus that it be use now as a way of say that all form of appreciation of art that be in place for century or millennia in the 20th century be discard the beauty and pleasure in art probably a human universal be begin to be consider saccharine or kitsch or commercial Barnett Newman have a famous quote that the impulse of modern art be the desire to destroy beauty which be consider bourgeois or tacky and here be just one example I mean this be perhaps a representative example of the visual depiction of the female form in the 15th century here be a representative example of the depiction of the female form in the 20th century and as you can see there something have change in the way the elite art appeal to the sens indeed in movement of modernism and post modernism there be visual art without beauty literature without narrative and plot poetry without meter and rhyme architecture and planning without ornament human scale green space and natural light music without melody and rhythm and criticism without clarity attention to aesthetics and insight into the human condition laughter let I give just you a example to back up that last statement but here there one of the most famous literary English scholar of we time be the Berkeley professor Judith Butler and here be a example of one of she analysis the move from a structuralist account in which capital be understand to structure social relation in relatively homologous way to a view of hegemony in which power relation be subject to repetition convergence and rearticulation bring the question of temporality into the thinking of structure and mark a shift from the form of Althusserian theory that take structural totality as theoretical object well you get the idea by the way this be one sentence you can actually parse it well the argument in the blank Slate be that elite art and criticism in the 20th century although not the art in general have disdain beauty pleasure clarity insight and style person be stay away from elite art and criticism what a puzzle I wonder why well this turn out to be probably the most controversial claim in the book someone ask I whether I stick it in in order to deflect ire from discussion of gender and Nazism and race and so on I will not comment on that but it certainly inspire a energetic reaction from many university professor well the other hot button be parenting and the starting point be the for that discussion be the fact that we have all be subject to the advice of the parenting industrial complex now here be here be a representative quote from a besiege mother I be overwhelmed with parenting advice I be suppose to do lot of physical activity with my kid so I can instill in they a physical fitness habit so they will grow up to be healthy adult and I be suppose to do all kind of intellectual play so they will grow up smart and there be all kind of play clay for finger dexterity word game for read success large motor play small motor play I feel like I could devote my life to figure out what to play with my kid I think anyone who be recently be a parent can sympathize with this mother well here be some sobering fact about parenting most study of parenting on which this advice be base be useless they be useless because they do not control for heritability they measure some correlation between what the parent do how the child turn out and assume a causal relation that the parenting shape the child parent who talk a lot to they kid have kid who grow up to be articulate parent who spank they kid have kid who grow up to be violent and so on and very few of they control for the possibility that parent pass on gene for that increase the chance a child will be articulate or violent and so on until the study be redo with adoptive child who provide a environment but not gene to they kid we have no way of know whether this conclusion be valid the genetically control study have some sobering result remember the Mallifert twin separate at birth then they meet in the patent office remarkably similar well what would have happen if the Mallifert twin have grow up together you might think well then they would be even more similar because not only would they share they gene but they would also share they environment that would make they super similar right wrong identical twin or any sibling who be separate at birth be no less similar than if they have grow up together everything that happen to you in a give home over all of that year appear to leave no permanent stamp on you personality or intellect a complementary finding from a completely different methodology be that adopt sibling rear together the mirror image of identical twin rear apart they share they parent they home they neighborhood do not share they gene end up not similar at all ok two different body of research with a similar finding what it suggest be that child be shape not by they parent over the long run but in part only in part by they gene in part by they culture the culture of the country at large and the child own culture namely they peer group as we hear from Jill Sobule early today that be what kid care about and to a very large extent large than most person be prepare to acknowledge by chance chance event in the wiring of the brain in utero chance event as you live you life so let I conclude with just a remark to bring it back to the theme of choice I think that the science of human nature behavioral genetics evolutionary psychology neuroscience cognitive science be go to increasingly in the year to come upset various dogma career and deeply hold political belief system and that present we with a choice the choice be whether certain fact about human or topic be to be consider taboo forbid knowledge where we should not go there because no good can come from it or whether we should explore they honestly I have my own answer to that question which come from a great artist of the 19th century Anton Chekhov who say Man will become well when you show he what he be like and I think that the argument can not be put any more eloquently than that thank you very much applause
