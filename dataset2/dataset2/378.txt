in he inaugural address Barack Obama appeal to each of we to give we good as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis but what do he appeal to he do not happily follow in the footstep of he predecessor and tell we to just go shop nor do he tell we trust we trust you country Invest invest invest instead what he tell we be to put aside childish thing and he appeal to virtue Virtue be a old fashioned word it seem a little out of place in a cutting edge environment like this one and besides some of you might be wonder what the hell do it mean let I begin with a example this be the job description of a hospital janitor that be scroll up on the screen and all of the item on it be unremarkable they be the thing you would expect mop the floor sweep they empty the trash restock the cabinet it may be a little surprising how many thing there be but it be not surprising what they be but the one thing I want you to notice about they be this even though this be a very long list there be not a single thing on it that involve other human being not one the janitor job could just as well be do in a mortuary as in a hospital and yet when some psychologist interview hospital janitor to get a sense of what they think they job be like they encounter Mike who tell they about how he stop mop the floor because Mr Jones be out of he bed get a little exercise try to build up he strength walk slowly up and down the hall and Charlene tell they about how she ignore she supervisor admonition and do not vacuum the visitor lounge because there be some family member who be there all day every day who at this moment happen to be take a nap and then there be Luke who wash the floor in a comatose young man room twice because the man father who have be keep a vigil for six month do not see Luke do it the first time and he father be angry and behavior like this from janitor from technician from nurse and if we be lucky now and then from doctor do not just make person feel a little good it actually improve the quality of patient care and enable hospital to run well now not all janitor be like this of course but the one who be think that this sort of human interaction involve kindness care and empathy be a essential part of the job and yet they job description contain not one word about other human being this janitor have the moral will to do right by other person and beyond this they have the moral skill to figure out what do right mean practical wisdom Aristotle tell we be the combination of moral will and moral skill a wise person know when and how to make the exception to every rule as the janitor know when to ignore the job duty in the service of other objective a wise person know how to improvise as Luke do when he be wash the floor real world problem be often ambiguous and ill define and the context be always change a wise person be like a jazz musician use the note on the page but dance around they invent combination that be appropriate for the situation and the person at hand a wise person know how to use this moral skill in the service of the right aim to serve other person not to manipulate other person and finally perhaps most important a wise person be make not bear Wisdom depend on experience and not just any experience you need the time to get to know the person that you be serve you need permission to be allow to improvise try new thing occasionally to fail and to learn from you failure and you need to be mentore by wise teacher when you ask the janitor who behave like the one I describe how hard it be to learn to do they job they tell you that it take lot of experience and they do not mean it take lot of experience to learn how to mop floor and empty trash can it take lot of experience to learn how to care for person at TED brilliance be rampant it be scary the good news be you do not need to be brilliant to be wise the bad news be that without wisdom brilliance be not enough it be as likely to get you and other person into trouble as anything else applause now I hope that we all know this there be a sense in which it be obvious and yet let I tell you a little story it be a story about lemonade a dad and he seven year old son be watch a Detroit Tigers game at the ballpark he son ask he for some lemonade and Dad go to the concession stand to buy it all they have be Mike hard lemonade which be five percent alcohol Dad be a academic have no idea that Mike hard lemonade contain alcohol so he bring it back and the kid be drink it and a security guard spot it and call the police who call a ambulance that rush to the ballpark whisk the kid to the hospital the emergency room ascertain that the kid have no alcohol in he blood and they be ready to let the kid go but not so fast the Wayne County Child Welfare Protection Agency say no and the child be send to a foster home for three day at that point can the child go home well a judge say yes but only if the dad leave the house and check into a motel after two week I be happy to report the family be reunite but the welfare worker and the ambulance person and the judge all say the same thing we hate to do it but we have to follow procedure how do thing like this happen Scott Simon who tell this story on NPR say rule and procedure may be dumb but they spare you from think and to be fair rule be often impose because previous official have be lax and they let a child go back to a abusive household fair enough when thing go wrong as of course they do we reach for two tool to try to fix they one tool we reach for be rule well one more of they the second tool we reach for be incentive well one more of they what else after all be there we can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis regulate regulate regulate fix the incentive fix the incentive fix the incentive the truth be that neither rule nor incentive be enough to do the job how could you even write a rule that get the janitor to do what they do and would you pay they a bonus for be empathic it be preposterous on its face and what happen be that as we turn increasingly to rule rule and incentive may make thing well in the short run but they create a downward spiral that make they bad in the long run Moral skill be chip away by a over reliance on rule that deprive we of the opportunity to improvise and learn from we improvisation and moral will be undermine by a incessant appeal to incentive that destroy we desire to do the right thing and without intend it by appeal to rule and incentive we be engage in a war on wisdom let I just give you a few example first of rule and the war on moral skill the lemonade story be one second no doubt more familiar to you be the nature of modern American education script lock step curricula here be a example from Chicago kindergarten Reading and enjoy literature and word that begin with b the bath assemble student on a rug and give student a warning about the danger of hot water say 75 item in this script to teach a 25 page picture book all over Chicago in every kindergarten class in the city every teacher be say the same word in the same way on the same day we know why this script be there we do not trust the judgment of teacher enough to let they loose on they own script like this be insurance policy against disaster and they prevent disaster but what they assure in its place be mediocrity applause do not get I wrong we need rule Jazz musician need some note most of they need some note on the page we need more rule for the banker God know but too many rule prevent accomplished jazz musician from improvise and as a result they lose they gift or bad they stop play altogether now how about incentive they seem clever if you have one reason for do something and I give you a second reason for do the same thing it seem only logical that two reason be good than one and you be more likely to do it right well not always sometimes two reason to do the same thing seem to compete with one another instead of compliment and they make person less likely to do it I will just give you one example because time be race in Switzerland back about 15 year ago they be try to decide where to site nuclear waste dump there be go to be a national referendum some psychologist go around and poll citizen who be very well informed and they say would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in you community astonishingly 50 percent of the citizen say yes they know it be dangerous they think it would reduce they property value but it have to go somewhere and they have responsibility as citizen the psychologist ask other person a slightly different question they say if we pay you six week salary every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in you community two reason it be my responsibility and I be get pay instead of 50 percent say yes 25 percent say yes what happen be that the second this introduction of incentive get we so that instead of ask what be my responsibility all we ask be what serve my interest when incentive do not work when ceo ignore the long term health of they company in pursuit of short term gain that will lead to massive bonus the response be always the same get smart incentive the truth be that there be no incentive that you can devise that be ever go to be smart enough any incentive system can be subvert by bad will we need incentive person have to make a live but excessive reliance on incentive demoralize professional activity in two sens of that word it cause person who engage in that activity to lose morale and it cause the activity itself to lose morality Barack Obama say before he be inaugurate we must ask not just be it profitable but be it right and when profession be demoralize everyone in they become dependent on addicted to incentive and they stop ask be it right we see this in medicine although it be nothing serious let keep a eye on it to make sure it do not turn into a major lawsuit and we certainly see it in the world of business in order to remain competitive in today marketplace I be afraid we be go to have to replace you with a sleezeball I sell my soul for about a tenth of what the damn thing be go for now it be obvious that this be not the way person want to do they work so what can we do a few source of hope we ought to try to be moralize work one way not to do it teach more ethic course applause there be no good way to show person that you be not serious than to tie up everything you have to say about ethic into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margin as a ethic course what to do instead one celebrate moral exemplar acknowledge when you go to law school that a little voice be whisper in you ear about Atticus Finch No 10 year old go to law school to do merger and acquisition person be inspire by moral hero but we learn that with sophistication come the understanding that you can not acknowledge that you have moral hero well acknowledge they be proud that you have they celebrate they and demand that the person who teach you acknowledge they and celebrate they too that be one thing we can do I do not know how many of you remember this another moral hero 15 year ago Aaron Feuerstein who be the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts they make Polartec the factory burn down 3 000 employee he keep every one of they on the payroll why because it would have be a disaster for they and for the community if he have let they go maybe on paper we company be worth less to Wall Street but I can tell you it be worth more we be do fine just at this TED we hear talk from several moral hero two be particularly inspire to I one be Ray Anderson who turn applause turn you know a part of the evil empire into a zero footprint or almost zero footprint business why because it be the right thing to do and a bonus he be discover be he be actually go to make even more money he employee be inspire by the effort why because there happy to be do something that be the right thing to do yesterday we hear Willie Smits talk about re forest in Indonesia applause in many way this be the perfect example because it take the will to do the right thing God know it take a huge amount of technical skill I be boggle at how much he and he associate need to know in order to plot this out but most important to make it work and he emphasize this be that it take know the person in the community unless the person you be work with be behind you this will fail and there be not a formula to tell you how to get the person behind you because different person in different community organize they life in different way so there be a lot here at TED and at other place to celebrate and you do not have to be a mega hero there be ordinary hero ordinary hero like the janitor who be worth celebrate too as practitioner each and every one of we should strive to be ordinary if not extraordinary hero as head of organization we should strive to create environment that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will even the wise and most well mean person will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organization in which they work if you run a organization you should be sure that none of the job none of the job have job description like the job description of the janitor because the truth be that any work that you do that involve interaction with other person be moral work and any moral work depend upon practical wisdom and perhaps most important as teacher we should strive to be the ordinary hero the moral exemplar to the person we mentor and there be a few thing that we have to remember as teacher one be that we be always teach someone be always watch the camera be always on Bill Gates talk about the importance of education and in particular the model that KIPP be provide knowledge be power and he talk about a lot of the wonderful thing that KIPP be do to take inner city kid and turn they in the direction of college I want to focus on one particular thing KIPP be do that Bill do not mention that be that they have come to the realization that the single most important thing kid need to learn be character they need to learn to respect themselves they need to learn to respect they schoolmate they need to learn to respect they teacher and most important they need to learn to respect learning that be the principle objective if you do that the rest be just pretty much a coast downhill and the teacher the way you teach this thing to the kid be by have the teacher and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day Obama appeal to virtue and I think he be right and the virtue I think we need above all other be practical wisdom because it be what allow other virtue honesty kindness courage and so on to be display at the right time and in the right way he also appeal to hope right again I think there be reason for hope I think person want to be allow to be virtuous in many way it be what TED be all about want to do the right thing in the right way for the right reason this kind of wisdom be within the grasp of each and every one of we if only we start pay attention pay attention to what we do to how we do it and perhaps most importantly to the structure of the organization within which we work so as to make sure that it enable we and other person to develop wisdom rather than have it suppress thank you very much thank you applause Chris Anderson you have to go and stand out here a sec Barry Schwartz thank you very much applause
