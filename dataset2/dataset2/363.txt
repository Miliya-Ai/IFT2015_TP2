my work be play and I play when I design I even look it up in the dictionary to make sure that I actually do that and the definition of play number one be engage in a childlike activity or endeavor and number two be gamble and I realize I do both when I be design I be both a kid and I be gamble all the time and I think that if you be not there be probably something inherently wrong with the structure or the situation you be in if you be a designer but the serious part be what throw I and I could not quite get a handle on it until I remember a essay and it be a essay I read 30 year ago it be write by Russell Baker who use to write a Observer column in the New York Times he be a wonderful humorist and I be go to read you this essay or a excerpt from it because it really hit home for I here be a letter of friendly advice be serious it say what it mean of course be be solemn be solemn be easy be serious be hard child almost always begin by be serious which be what make they so entertaining when compare with adult as a class adult on the whole be solemn in politics the rare candidate who be serious like Adlai Stevenson be easily overwhelm by one who be solemn like Eisenhower that be because it be hard for most person to recognize seriousness which be rare but more comfortable to endorse solemnity which be commonplace jogging which be commonplace and widely accept as good for you be solemn Poker be serious Washington D C be solemn New York be serious go to educational conference to tell you anything about the future be solemn take a long walk by yourself during which you devise a foolproof scheme for rob Tiffany be serious laughter now when I apply Russell Baker definition of solemnity or seriousness to design it do not necessarily make any particular point about quality Solemn design be often important and very effective design Solemn design be also socially correct and be accept by appropriate audience it be what right thinking designer and all the client be strive for serious design serious play be something else for one thing it often happen spontaneously intuitively accidentally or incidentally it can be achieve out of innocence or arrogance or out of selfishness sometimes out of carelessness but mostly it be achieve through all that kind of crazy part of human behavior that do not really make any sense serious design be imperfect it be fill with the kind of craft law that come from something be the first of its kind serious design be also often quite unsuccessful from the solemn point of view that be because the art of serious play be about invention change rebellion not perfection perfection happen during solemn play now I always see design career like surreal staircase if you look at the staircase you will see that in you 20 the riser be very high and the step be very short and you make huge discovery you sort of leap up very quickly in you youth that be because you do not know anything and you have a lot to learn and so that anything you do be a learning experience and you be just jump right up there as you get old the riser get shallow and the step get wide and you start move along at a slow pace because you be make few discovery and as you get old and more decrepit you sort of inch along on this sort of depress long staircase lead you into oblivion laughter I find it be actually get really hard to be serious I be hire to be solemn but I find more and more that I be solemn when I do not have to be and in my 35 year of work experience I think I be really serious four time and I be go to show they to you now because they come out of very specific condition it be great to be a kid now when I be in my early 20 I work in the record business design record cover for CBS Records and I have no idea what a great job I have I think everybody have a job like that and what the way I look at design and the way I look at the world be what be go on around I and the thing that come at the time I walk into design be the enemy I really really really hate the typeface Helvetica I think the typeface Helvetica be the clean most boring most fascistic really repressive typeface and I hate everything that be design in Helvetica and when I be in my college day this be the sort of design that be fashionable and popular this be actually quite a lovely book jacket by Rudy de Harak but I just hate it because it be design with Helvetica and I make parody about it I just think it be you know completely boring laughter so so my goal in life be to do stuff that be not make out of Helvetica and to do stuff that be not make out of Helvetica be actually kind of hard because you have to find it and there be not a lot of book about the history of design in the early 70 there be not there be not a plethora of design publishing you actually have to go to antique store you have to go to Europe you have to go place and find the stuff and what I respond to be you know Art Nouveau or deco or Victorian typography or thing that be just completely not Helvetica and I teach myself design this way and this be sort of my early year and I use this thing in really goofy way on record cover and in my design I be not educate I just sort of put this thing together I mix up Victorian design with pop and I mix up Art Nouveau with something else and I make this very lush very elaborate record cover not because I be be a post modernist or a historicist because I do not know what that thing be I just hate Helvetica laughter and that kind of passion drive I into very serious play a kind of play I could never do now because I be too well educate and there be something wonderful about that form of youth where you can let yourself grow and play and be really a brat and then accomplish thing by the end of the 70 actually the stuff become known I mean this cover appear all over the world and they start win award and person know they and I be suddenly a post modernist and I begin a career as in my own business and first I be praise for it then criticize for it but the fact of the matter be I have become solemn I do not do what I think be a piece of serious work again for about 14 year I spend most of the 80 be quite solemn turn out this sort of design that I be expect to do because that be who I be and I be live in this cycle of go from serious to solemn to hackneyed to dead and get rediscover all over again so here be the second condition for which I think I accomplish some serious play there be a Paul Newman movie that I love call the verdict I do not know how many of you have see it but it be a beaut and in the movie he play a down and out lawyer who be become a ambulance chaser and he be take on he be give actually a malpractice suit to handle that sort of a easy deal and in the midst of try to connect the deal he start to empathize and identify with he client and he regain he morality and purpose and he go on to win the case and in the depth of despair in the midst of the movie when it look like he can not pull this thing off and he need this case he need to win this case so badly there be a shot of Paul Newman alone in he office say this be the case there be no other case this be the case there be no other case and in that moment of desire and focus he can win and that be a wonderful position to be in to create some serious play and I have that moment in 1994 when I meet a theater director name George Wolfe who be go to have I design a identity for the New York Shakespeare Festival then know and then become the Public Theater and I begin get immerse in this project in a way I never be before this be what theater advertising look like at that time this be what be in the newspaper and in the New York Times so this be sort of a comment on the time and the Public Theater actually have much good advertising than this they have no logo and no identity but they have this very iconic poster paint by Paul Davis and George Wolf have take over from another director and he want to change the theater and he want to make it urban and loud and a place that be inclusive so draw on my love of typography I immerse myself into this project and what be different about it be the totality of it be that I really become the voice the visual voice of a place in a way I have never do before where every aspect the small ad the ticket whatever it be be design by I there be no format there be no in house department that this thing be push to I literally for three year make everything every scrap of paper everything online that this theater do and it be the only job even though I be do other job I live and breathe it in a way I have not with a client since it enable I to really express myself and grow and I think that you know when you be go to be give this position and it be rare but when you get it and you have this opportunity it be the moment of serious play I do this thing and I still do they I still work for the Public Theater I be on they board and I still be involve with it the high point of the Public Theater I think be in 1996 two year after I design it which be the bring in da noise bring in da Funk campaign that be all over New York but something happen to it and what happen to it be it become very popular and that be a kiss of death for something serious because it make it solemn and what happen be that New York City to a degree eat my identity because person begin to copy it here be a ad in the New York Times somebody do for a play call mind Games then Chicago come out use similar graphic and the Public Theater identity be just totally eat and take away which mean I have to change it so I change it so that every season be different and I continue to do this poster but they never have the seriousness of the first identity because they be too individual and they do not have that heft of everything be the same thing now and I think since the Public Theater I must have do more than a dozen cultural identity for major institution and I do not think I ever I ever grasp that seriousness again I do they for very big important institution in New York City the institution be solemn and so be the design they be better craft than the Public Theater be and they spend more money on they but I think that that moment come and go the good way to accomplish serious design which I think we all have the opportunity to do be to be totally and completely unqualified for the job that do not happen very often but it happen to I in the year 2000 when for some reason or another a whole pile of different architect start to ask I to design the inside of theater with they where I would take environmental graphic and work they into building I would never do this kind of work before I do not know how to read a architectural plan I do not know what they be talk about and I really could not handle the fact that a job a single job could go on for four year because I be use to immediacy in graphic design and that kind of attention to detail be really bad for somebody like I with add so it be a rough it be a rough go but I fall in love with this process of actually integrate graphic into architecture because I do not know what I be do I say why can not the signage be on the floor New Yorkers look at they foot and then I find that actor and actress actually take they cue from the floor so it turn out that this sort of sign system begin to make sense they integrate with the building in really peculiar way they run around corner they go up side of building and they meld into the architecture this be Symphony Space on 90th Street and Broadway and the type be interweave into the stainless steel and backlit with fiber optics and the architect Jim Polshek essentially give I a canvas to play typography out on and it be serious play this be the child museum in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania make out of completely inexpensive material extruded typography that be backlit with neon thing I never do before build before I just think they would be kind of fun to do donor wall make out of Lucite and then inexpensive signage laughter I think my favorite of this be this little job in Newark New Jersey it be a perform art school this be the building that they have no money and they have to recast it and they say if we give you 100 000 dollar what can you do with it and I do a little photoshop job on it and I say well I think we can paint it and we do and it be play and there be the building everything be paint typography over the whole damn thing include the air conditioning duct I hire guy who paint flat fix on the side of garage to do the painting on the building and they love it they get into it they take the job incredibly seriously they use to climb up on the building and call I and tell I that they have to correct my typography that my spacing be wrong and they move it and they do wonderful thing with it they be pretty serious too it be quite wonderful by the time I do Bloomberg headquarters my work have begin to become accepted person want it in big expensive place and that begin to make it solemn Bloomberg be all about number and we do big number through the space and the number be project on a spectacular led that my partner Lisa Strausfeld program but it become the end of the seriousness of the play and it start to once again become solemn this be a current project in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania where I get to be goofy I be invite to design a logo for this neighborhood call the North side and I think it be silly for a neighborhood to have a logo I think that be rather creepy actually why would a neighborhood have a logo a neighborhood have a thing it be get a landmark it be get a place it be get a restaurant it do not have a logo I mean what would that be so I have to actually give a presentation to a city council and neighborhood constituent and I go to Pittsburgh and I say you know really what you have here be all this underpass that separate the neighborhood from the center of town why do not you celebrate they and make the underpass landmark so I begin do this crazy presentation of this installation potential installation on this underpass bridge and stand up in front of the city council and be a little bit scared I have to admit but I be so utterly unqualified for this project and so utterly ridiculous and ignore the brief so desperately that I think they just embrace it with wholeheartedness just completely because it be so goofy to begin with and this be the bridge they be actually paint up and prepare as we speak it will change every six month and it will become a art installation in the North side of Pittsburgh and it will probably become a landmark in the area John Hockenberry tell you a bit about my travail with Citibank that be now a 10 year relationship and I still work with they and I actually be amuse by they and like they and think that as a very very very very very big corporation they actually keep they graphic very nice I draw the logo for Citibank on a napkin in the first meeting that be the play part of the job and then I spend a year go to long tedious boring meeting try to sell this logo through to a huge corporation to the point of tear I think I be go to go crazy at the end of this year we make idiotic presentation show how the Citi logo make sense and how it be really derive from a umbrella and we make animation of this thing and we come back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and it be worth it because they buy this thing and it play out on such a grand scale and it be so internationally recognizable but for I it be actually a very very depressing year as a matter of fact they actually never buy onto the logo until Fallon put it on its very good live richly campaign and then everybody accept it all over the world so during this time I need some kind of counterbalance for this crazy crazy existence of go to this long idiotic meeting and I be up in my country house and for some reason I begin paint this very big very involved laborious complicated map of the entire world and list every place on the planet and put they in and misspell they and put thing in the wrong spot and completely control the information and go totally and completely nuts with it they would take I about six month initially but then I start get fast at it here be the United States every single city of the United States be on here and it hang for about eight month at the Cooper Hewitt and person walk up to it and they would point to a part of the map and they would say oh I have be here and of course they could not have be because it be in the wrong spot laughter but what I like about it be I be control my own idiotic information and I be create my own palette of information and I be totally and completely at play one of my favorite be this painting I do of Florida after the 2000 election that have the election result roll around in the water I keep that for evidence laughter somebody be up at my house and see the painting and recommend they to a gallery and I have a first show about two and a half year ago and I show this painting that I be show you now and then a funny thing happen they sell and they sell quickly and become rather popular we start make print from they this be Manhattan one from the series this be a print from the United States which we do in red white and blue we begin do this big silkscreen print and they start sell too so the gallery want I to have another show in two year which mean that I really have to paint this painting much fast than I have ever do they and I they start to become more political and I pick area that sort of be in the news or that I have some feeling about and I begin do this thing and then this funny thing happen I find that I be no long at play I be actually in this solemn landscape of fulfil a expectation for a show which be not where I start with this thing so while they become successful I know how to make they so I be not a neophyte and they be no long serious they have become solemn and that be a terrifying factor when you start something and it turn that way because it mean that all that be leave for you be to go back and to find out what the next thing be that you can push that you can invent that you can be ignorant about that you can be arrogant about that you can fail with and that you can be a fool with because in the end that be how you grow and that be all that matter so I be plug along here laughter and I be just go to have to blow up the staircase thank you very much
