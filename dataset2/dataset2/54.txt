if you take 10 000 person at random 9 999 have something in common they interest in business lie on or near the Earth surface the odd one out be a astronomer and I be one of that strange breed laughter my talk will be in two part I will talk first as a astronomer and then as a worried member of the human race but let start off by remember that Darwin show how we be the outcome of four billion year of evolution and what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology be to go back before Darwin simple beginning to set we earth in a cosmic context and let I just run through a few slide this be the impact that happen last week on a comet if they have send a nuke it would have be rather more spectacular than what actually happen last Monday so that be another project for NASA that be Mars from the European Mars Express and at New Year this artist impression turn into reality when a parachute land on Titan Saturn giant moon it land on the surface this be picture take on the way down that look like a coastline it be indeed but the ocean be liquid methane the temperature minus 170 degree centigrade if we go beyond we solar system we have learn that the star be not twinkly point of light each one be like a sun with a retinue of planet orbit around it and we can see place where star be form like the Eagle Nebula we see star die in six billion year the sun will look like that and some star die spectacularly in a supernova explosion leave remnant like that on a still big scale we see entire galaxy of star we see entire ecosystem where gas be be recycle and to the cosmologist this galaxy be just the atom as it be of the large scale universe this picture show a patch of sky so small that it would take about 100 patch like it to cover the full moon in the sky through a small telescope this would look quite blank but you see here hundred of little faint smudge each be a galaxy fully like ours or Andromeda which look so small and faint because its light have take 10 billion light year to get to we the star in that galaxy probably do not have planet around they there be scant chance of life there that be because there be be no time for the nuclear fusion in star to make silicon and carbon and iron the building block of planet and of life we believe that all of this emerge from a Big Bang a hot dense state so how do that amorphous Big Bang turn into we complex cosmos I be go to show you a movie simulation 16 power of 10 fast than real time which show a patch of the universe where the expansion have subtract out but you see as time go on in gigayear at the bottom you will see structure evolve as gravity feed on small dense irregularity and structure develop and we will end up after 13 billion year with something look rather like we own universe and we compare simulated universe like that I will show you a good simulation at the end of my talk with what we actually see in the sky well we can trace thing back to the early stage of the Big Bang but we still do not know what bang and why it bang that be a challenge for 21st century science if my research group have a logo it would be this picture here a ouroboros where you see the micro world on the leave the world of the quantum and on the right the large scale universe of planet star and galaxy we know we universe be unite though link between left and right the everyday world be determine by atom how they stick together to make molecule star be fuel by how the nucleus in that atom react together and as we have learn in the last few year galaxy be hold together by the gravitational pull of so call dark matter particle in huge swarm far small even than atomic nucleus but we would like to know the synthesis symbolize at the very top the micro world of the quantum be understand on the right hand side gravity hold sway Einstein explain that but the unfinished business for 21st century science be to link together cosmos and micro world with a unified theory symbolize as it be gastronomically at the top of that picture laughter and until we have that synthesis we will not be able to understand the very beginning of we universe because when we universe be itself the size of a atom quantum effect could shake everything and so we need a theory that unify the very large and the very small which we do not yet have one idea incidentally and I have this hazard sign to say I be go to speculate from now on be that we Big Bang be not the only one one idea be that we three dimensional universe may be embed in a high dimensional space just as you can imagine on this sheet of paper you can imagine ant on one of they think it be a two dimensional universe not be aware of another population of ant on the other so there could be another universe just a millimeter away from ours but we be not aware of it because that millimeter be measure in some fourth spatial dimension and we be imprison in we three and so we believe that there may be a lot more to physical reality than what we have normally call we universe the aftermath of we Big Bang and here be another picture bottom right depict we universe which on the horizon be not beyond that but even that be just one bubble as it be in some vast reality many person suspect that just as we have go from believe in one solar system to zillion of solar system one galaxy to many galaxy we have to go to many big Bangs from one Big Bang perhaps this many big Bangs display a immense variety of property well let go back to this picture there be one challenge symbolize at the top but there be another challenge to science symbolize at the bottom you want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small but we want to understand the very complex and the most complex thing be ourselves midway between atom and star we depend on star to make the atom we be make of we depend on chemistry to determine we complex structure we clearly have to be large compare to atom to have layer upon layer of complex structure we clearly have to be small compare to star and planet otherwise we would be crush by gravity and in fact we be midway it would take as many human body to make up the sun as there be atom in each of we the geometric mean of the mass of a proton and the mass of the sun be 50 kilogram within a factor of two of the mass of each person here well most of you anyway the science of complexity be probably the great challenge of all great than that of the very small on the left and the very large on the right and it be this science which be not only enlighten we understanding of the biological world but also transform we world fast than ever and more than that it be engender new kind of change and I now move on to the second part of my talk and the book Our Final Century be mention if I be not a self efface brit I would mention the book myself and I would add that it be available in paperback laughter and in America it be call Our Final Hour because American like instant gratification laughter but my theme be that in this century not only have science change the world fast than ever but in new and different way target drug genetic modification artificial intelligence perhaps even implant into we brain may change human be themselves and human be they physique and character have not change for thousand of year it may change this century it be new in we history and the human impact on the global environment greenhouse warming mass extinction and so forth be unprecedented too and so this make this coming century a challenge Bio and cybertechnology be environmentally benign in that they offer marvelous prospects while nonetheless reduce pressure on energy and resource but they will have a dark side in we interconnect world novel technology could empower just one fanatic or some weirdo with a mindset of that who now design computer virus to trigger some kind on disaster indeed catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure error rather than terror and even a tiny probability of catastrophe be unacceptable when the downside could be of global consequence in fact some year ago Bill Joy write a article express tremendous concern about robot take we over etc I do not go along with all that but it be interesting that he have a simple solution it be what he call fine grain relinquishment he want to give up the dangerous kind of science and keep the good bit now that be absurdly naive for two reason first any scientific discovery have benign consequence as well as dangerous one and also when a scientist make a discovery he or she normally have no clue what the application be go to be and so what this mean be that we have to accept the risk if we be go to enjoy the benefit of science we have to accept that there will be hazard and I think we have to go back to what happen in the post War era post World War II when the nuclear scientist who have be involve in make the atomic bomb in many case be concern that they should do all they could to alert the world to the danger and they be inspire not by the young Einstein who do the great work in relativity but by the old Einstein the icon of poster and t shirt who fail in he scientific effort to unify the physical law he be premature but he be a moral compass a inspiration to scientist who be concern with arm control and perhaps the great live person be someone I be privileged to know Joe Rothblatt equally untidy office there as you can see he be 96 year old and he find the Pugwash movement he persuade Einstein as he last act to sign the famous memorandum of Bertrand Russell and he set a example of the concerned scientist and I think to harness science optimally to choose which door to open and which to leave closed we need latter day counterpart of person like Joseph Rothblatt we need not just campaign physicist but we need biologist computer expert and environmentalist as well and I think academic and independent entrepreneur have a special obligation because they have more freedom than that in government service or company employee subject to commercial pressure I write my book Our Final Century as a scientist just a general scientist but there be one respect I think in which be a cosmologist offer a special perspective and that be that it offer a awareness of the immense future the stupendous time span of the evolutionary past be now part of common culture outside the American Bible Belt anyway laughter but most person even that who be familiar with evolution be not mindful that even more time lie ahead the sun have be shine for four and a half billion year but it will be another six billion year before its fuel run out on that schematic picture a sort of time lapse picture we be halfway and it will be another six billion before that happen and any remain life on Earth be vaporize there be a unthinking tendency to imagine that human will be there experience the sun demise but any life and intelligence that exist then will be as different from we as we be from bacterium the unfolding of intelligence and complexity still have immensely far to go here on Earth and probably far beyond so we be still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity in we Earth and beyond if you represent the Earth lifetime by a single year say from January when it be make to December the 21st century would be a quarter of a second in June a tiny fraction of the year but even in this concertina cosmic perspective we century be very very special the first when human can change themselves and they home planet as I should have show this early it will not be human who witness the end point of the sun it will be creature as different from we as we be from bacterium when Einstein die in 1955 one striking tribute to he global status be this cartoon by Herblock in the Washington Post the plaque read Albert Einstein live here and I would like to end with a vignette as it be inspire by this image we have be familiar for 40 year with this image the fragile beauty of land ocean and cloud contrast with the sterile moonscape on which the astronaut leave they footprint but let suppose some alien have be watch we pale blue dot in the cosmos from afar not just for 40 year but for the entire 4 5 billion year history of we Earth what would they have see over nearly all that immense time Earth appearance would have change very gradually the only abrupt worldwide change would have be major asteroid impact or volcanic super eruption apart from that brief trauma nothing happen suddenly the continental landmass drift around ice cover wax and wane succession of new species emerge evolve and become extinct but in just a tiny sliver of the Earth history the last one millionth part a few thousand year the pattern of vegetation alter much fast than before this signal the start of agriculture change have accelerate as human population rise then other thing happen even more abruptly within just 50 year that be one hundredth of one millionth of the Earth age the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere start to rise and ominously fast the planet become a intense emitter of radio wave the total output from all tv and cell phone and radar transmission and something else happen metallic object albeit very small one a few ton at most escape into orbit around the Earth some journey to the moon and planet a race of advanced extraterrestrial watch we solar system from afar could confidently predict Earth final doom in another six billion year but could they have predict this unprecedented spike less than halfway through the Earth life this human induce alteration occupy overall less than a millionth of the elapse lifetime and seemingly occur with runaway speed if they continue they vigil what might this hypothetical alien witness in the next hundred year will some spasm foreclose Earth future or will the biosphere stabilize or will some of the metallic object launch from the Earth spawn new oasis a post human life elsewhere the science do by the young Einstein will continue as long as we civilization but for civilization to survive we will need the wisdom of the old Einstein humane global and farseeing and whatever happen in this uniquely crucial century will resonate into the remote future and perhaps far beyond the Earth far beyond the Earth as depict here thank you very much applause
