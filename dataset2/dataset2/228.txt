a few word about how I get start and it have a lot to do with happiness actually when I be a very young child I be extremely introverted and very much to myself and kind of as a way of survive I would go into my own very personal space and I would make thing I would make thing for person as a way of you know give show they my love I would go into this private place and I would put my idea and my passion into object and sort of learn how to speak with my hand so the whole activity of work with my hand and create object be very much connect with not only the idea realm but also with very much the feeling realm and the idea be very disparate I be go to show you many different kind of piece and there be no real connection between one or the other except that they sort of come out of my brain and they be all different sort of thought that be trigger by look at life and see nature and see object and just have kind of playful random thought about thing when I be a child I start to explore motion I fall in love with the way thing move so I start to explore motion by make little flipbook and this be one that I do probably like when I be around seventh grade and I remember when I be do this I be think about that little rock there and the pathway of the vehicle as they would fly through the air and how the character laughter would come shoot out of the car so on my mind I be think about the trajectory of the vehicle and of course when you be a little kid there be always destruction so it have to end with this laughter gratuitous violence laughter so that be how I first start to explore the way thing move and express it now when I go to college I find myself make fairly complicated fragile machine and this really come about from have many different kind of interest when I be in high school I love to program computer so I sort of like the logical flow of event I be also very interested in perhaps go into surgery and become a surgeon because it mean work with my hand in a very focused intense way so I start take art course and I find a way to make sculpture that bring together my love for be very precise with my hand with come up with different kind of logical flow of energy through a system and also work with wire everything that I do be both a visual and a mechanical engineering decision at the same time so I be able to sort of exercise all of that now this kind of machine be as close as I can get to painting and it be full of many little trivial end point like there be a little foot here that just drag around in circle and it do not really mean anything it be really just for the sort of joy of its own triviality the connection I have with engineering be the same as any other engineer in that I love to solve problem I love to figure thing out but the end result of what I be do be really completely ambiguous laughter that be pretty ambiguous laughter the next piece that be go to come up be a example of a kind of machine that be fairly complex I give myself the problem since I be always like to solve problem I give myself the problem of turn a crank in one direction and solve all of the mechanical problem for get this little man to walk back and forth so when I start this I do not have a overall plan for the machine but I do have a sense of the gesture and a sense of the shape and how it would occupy space and then it be a matter of start from one point and sort of building to that final point that little gear there switch back and forth to change direction and that be a little find object so a lot of the piece that I have make they involve find object and it really it be almost like do visual pun all the time when I see object I imagine they in motion I imagine what can be say with they this next one here machine with wishbone it come about from play with this wishbone after dinner you know they say never play with you food but I always play with thing so I have this wishbone and I think it be kind of like a cowboy who be be on he horse for too long laughter and I start to make he walk across the table and I think oh I can make a little machine that will do that so I make this device link it up and the wishbone walk and because the wishbone be bone it be animal it be sort of a point where I think we can enter into it and that be the whole piece laughter that be about that big applause this kind of work be also very much like puppetry where the find object be in a sense the puppet and I be the puppeteer at first because I be play with a object but then I make the machine which be sort of the stand in for I and it be able to achieve the action that I want the next piece I will show you be a much more conceptual thought and it be a little piece call cory yellow chair I have this image in my mind when I see my son little chair and I see it explode up and out and so the way I see this in my mind at first be that the piece would explode up and out with infinite speed and the piece would move far out and then they would begin to be pull back with a kind of a gravitational feel to the point where they would approach infinite speed back to the center and they would coalesce for just a moment so you could perceive that there be a chair there for I it be kind of a feeling about the fleetingness of the present moment and I want to express that now the machine be in this case it be a real approximation of that because obviously you can not move physical matter infinitely with infinite speed and have it stop instantaneously this whole thing be about four foot wide and the chair itself be only about a few inch applause now this be a funny sort of conceptual thing and yesterday we be talk about Danny Hillis 10 000 year clock so we have a motor here on the left and it go through a gear train there be 12 pair of 50 1 reduction so that mean that the final speed of that gear on the end be so slow that it would take two trillion year to turn once so I have invent it in concrete because it do not really matter laughter because it could run all the time laughter now a completely different thought I be always imagine myself in different situation I be imagine myself as a machine what would I love I would love to be bath in oil laughter so this machine do nothing but just bathe itself in oil laughter applause and it be really just sort of for I it be just really about the lusciousness of oil laughter and then I get a call from a friend who want to have a show of erotic art and I do not have any piece but when she suggest to be in the show this piece come to mind so it be sort of related but you can see it be much more overtly erotic and this one I call machine with grease it be just continually ejaculate and it be laughter this be a happy machine I will tell you laughter it be definitely happy from a engineering point of view this be just a little four bar linkage and then again this be a find object a little fan that I find and I think what about the gesture of open the fan and how simply could I state something and in a case like this I be try to make something which be clear but also not suggestive of any particular kind of animal or plant for I the process be very important because I be invent machine but I be also invent tool to make machine and the whole thing be all sort of wrap up from the begin so this be a little wire bend tool after many year of bend gear with a pair of pliers I make that tool and then I make this other tool for sort of center gear very quickly sort of develop my own little world of technology my life completely change when I find a spot welder laughter and that be that tool it completely change what I could do now here I be go to do a very poor job of silver soldering this be not the way they teach you to silver solder when you be in school I just like throw it in I mean real jeweler put little bit of solder in so that be a finished gear when I move to Boston I join a group call the World sculpture race society laughter and the idea they premise be that we want to show piece of sculpture on the street and there would be no subjective decision about what be the good it would be whatever come across the finish line first would be the winner laughter so I make this be my first racing sculpture and I think oh I be go to make a cart and I be go to have it I be go to have my hand writing fast so as I run down the street the cart be go to talk to I and it be go to go fast fast so that be what it do laughter but then in the end what I decide be every time you finish write the word I would stop and I would give the card to somebody on the side of the road so I would never win the race because I be always stop but I have a lot of fun applause now I only have two and a half minute I be go to play this this be a piece that for I be in some way the most complete kind of piece because when I be a kid I also play a lot of guitar and when I have this thought I be imagine that I would make I would have a whole machine theater evening where I would you would have a audience the curtain would open and you would be entertain by machine on stage so I imagine a very simple gestural dance that would be between a machine and just a very simple chair and when I be make this piece I be always try to find a point where I be say something very clearly and it be very simple but also at the same time it be very ambiguous and I think there be a point between simplicity and ambiguity which can allow a viewer to perhaps take something from it and that lead I to the thought that all of this piece start off in my own mind in my heart and I do my good at find way to express they with material and it always feel really crude it be always a struggle but somehow I manage to sort of get this think out into a object and then it be there ok it mean nothing at all the object itself just mean nothing once it be perceive and someone bring it into they own mind then there be a cycle that have be complete and to I that be the most important thing because ever since be a kid I have want to communicate my passion and love and that mean the complete cycle of come from inside out to the physical to someone perceive it so I will just let this chair come down applause thank you applause
