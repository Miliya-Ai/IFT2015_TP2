I would like to speak about technology trend which be something that many of you follow but we also follow for related reason obviously be a technology magazine technology trend be something that we write about and need to know about but also it be part of be any monthly magazine you live in the future and we have a long lead time we have to plan issue many month in advance we have to guess at what public appetite be go to be six month nine month down the road so we be in the forecasting business we also like a lot of company create a product that be base on technology trend in this case ours be about idea and information and if we be lucky some entertainment but the concept quite the same and so we have to understand not only why tech important where it be go but also very importantly when the timing be everything and it be interesting when you look at the prediction make during the peak of the boom in the 1990 about e commerce or internet traffic or broadband adoption or internet advertising they be all right they be just wrong in time almost every one of that have come true just a few year later but the difference of a few year on stock market valuation be obviously extreme and that be why timing be everything you have probably see something like this before this be the classic Gartner hype curve which talk about kind of the trajectory of a technology lifespan and just for fun we put a bunch of technology on it to show whether they be kind of rise for the first high peak or whether they be about to crash into the trough of disillusionment or rise back in the slope of enlightenment etc and this be one way to do technology forecasting get a sense of where technology be and then anticipate the next upturn we tend to do any technology that we think be sufficiently important we will typically do it twice once we want to do it first we want to be the first to do it for the geek who appreciate that we will catch it right there at the technology trigger you can see in 1997 we put Linux on the cover but then it come back and sufficiently big technology be go to hit the mainstream and they be go to burst out and then it be time to do it again last year and that be one way that we try to time technology trend I would like to talk about a way of think about technology trend that I call my grand unified theory of predict the future but it be close to a petite unified theory of predict the future it be base on the presumption the observation even that all important technology go through four stage in they life at least one of the four stage sometimes all four of the stage and at each one of this stage can be see as a collision a collision with something else for example a critical price line that change both the technology and also change its effect on the world it be a inflection point and this be the inflection point that tell you what the next chapter in that technology life be go to be and maybe how you can do something about it the first be the critical price the first stage in a technology advance be that it will fall below a critical price after it fall below a critical price it will tend if it be successful to rise above a critical mass a penetration many technology at that point displace another technology and that be another important point and then finally a lot of technology commoditize towards the end of they life they become nearly free each one of that be a opportunity to do something about it it be a opportunity for the technology to change and even if you miss you know the first boom of Wi Fi you know Wi Fi do the critical price it do the critical mass but have not do displacement yet and have not do free yet there be still more opportunity in that I would like to demonstrate what I mean by this by tell the story of the dvd which be a technology which have do all of this the dvd as you know be introduce in the mid 1990 and it be quite expensive but you can see that by 1998 it have fall below 400 dollar and 400 dollar be a psychological threshold and it start to take off and you can see that the unit start to trend up the hide inflection point it be take off the next thing it hit a year late be critical mass in this case 20 percent be often a good proxy for critical mass in a household and what be interesting here be that something else take off along with it home theater unit suddenly you have a dvd in the house you have get high quality digital video you have a reason to have a big screen television you have a reason for Dolby 5 1 surround sound and maybe you have reason for start to connect they and bring the rest of you entertainment in what be interesting also be note that Netflix be found in 1999 Reed Hastings be here he clearly see that that be a moment that be a inflection point that he could do something with the next phase it hit be displacement you can see around 2001 it finally out sell the VCR and here too you can see the implication in the world at large Netflix be right the Netflix model could capitalize on the dvd in a way that the video rental store could not among the DVD many asset be that it be very small you can stick it in the mailer and post it cheaply that give a advantage that be a implication of the technology rise that be not obvious to everybody and then finally dvd be approach free there be a company call Apex a no name Chinese firm who have several time in the past year be the number one dvd seller in America they average price for last year be 48 dollar you be aware of the perhaps apocryphal Wal Mart stampede over the 30 dollar DVD but they be get very very cheap and look at the interesting implication of it as they get cheap the premium brand the Sonys and such be lose market share and the no name the Apexes be gain they they be be commodify and that be what happen when thing go to zero it be a tough market out there laughter now they have introduce this four way of look at technology this four stage of technology life I would like to talk about some other technology out there just technology on we radar and I will use this lens this four as a way to kind of tell you where each one of that technology be in its development they be not necessarily the top 10 technology out there they be just example of technology that be in each one of this period but I think that the implication of they approach this crossover this intersection be interesting to think about start with gene sequencing as you probably know gene sequencing in a large part because it be build on computer be fall in price at a kind of a Moore Law like level it be now possible will be possible and if Craig Venter indeed come today he may tell you something about this to sequence the human genome for 40 million dollar by the end of this year that be as oppose to billion just a few year ago you know we ability to capture the tool of creation be get close and close what be interesting be that at the same time the number of gene that we be discover be rise very quickly each one of this gene have potential diagnostic test there will come a day when you can have hundred of thousand of test do very cheaply if you want to know you can learn about you own Mosaic here be another technology that be approach a critical price this be a fascinating research from who that show the effect of generic drug on anti retroviral drug compound and cocktail in January 2000 the price be 10 000 dollar or 27 dollar a day the generic come in first in Brazil and elsewhere and the effect be just dramatic on price today it be less than 50 cent a day and what be interesting be if you look at the price elasticity if you look at the correlation between this two as the anti retroviral come down the number of person you can treat go radically up and the Clinton Foundation and who believe that they can treat three million person worldwide by 2005 two million in sub Saharan Africa and the fall price of drug have a lot to do with that Linux be another good example now we have switch to critical mass this be now technology that be hit critical mass if you look here here be Linux in red and it be hit 20 percent interestingly it be do a crossover before but not the crossover that matter the crossover that be go to matter be the one with the blue but you can look and see the direction that line be go you can see that at the 20 percent it be now take seriously it be not just for the geek any more that be I imagine what person in Redmond wake up in the middle of the night think about laughter another technology that we see all around we out here be hybrid car I do not know whether anybody have a Prius 2004 but they be fantastic and if you look at the trend here by about 2008 and I do not think this be a crazy forecast they will be two percent of auto sale two percent be not 20 percent but in the car business which be slow move that be huge that be arrival at two percent you start see they on the road everywhere and what be interesting about the hybrid take off be you have now introduce electric motor to the automobile industry it be the first radical change in automobile technology in 100 year and once you have electric motor you can do anything you can change the structure of the car in any way you want you can have regenerative brake you can have drive by wire you can have replaceable body shape it be a little thing that start with a hybrid but it can lead to a whole new era of the car Voice over IP be something you may have hear something about again it be kind of come out of nowhere it be a little hard to use right now there be a company create by the Kazaa founder call Skype look at this number they launch it in August of last year they already have nearly four million register user that critical mass and the same thing happen on the carrier side you be look at IP take over from some of the traditional telecom standard this be a tip point if Malcolm here forgive I and it be go to change the economics and the speed and the player in the industry it be go to look a little bit like that and finally free Free be really really interesting Free be something that come with digital because the reproduction cost be essentially free it come with ip because it be such a efficient protocol it come with fiber optics because there be so much bandwidth Free be really you know the gift of Silicon Valley to the world it be a economic force it be a technical force it be a deflationary force if not handle right it be abundance as oppose to scarcity Free be probably the most interesting thing and here you have just the number of song that can be store on a hard drive you know there could be a film unclear there but it be basically every song ever make could be store on 400 dollar worth of storage by 2008 it take that entire element the physical element of song off the table and you have see the number I mean you know the music industry be implode in front of we very eye and Hollywood worried as well they be face a force that they have not face before and they response be draconian and not necessarily the one that be go to get they out of this and finally I will give you one last example of free perhaps the most powerful of all I mention fiber optics they abundance tend to make thing free this be the price of a phone call to India per minute and what be interesting be that it be just 1990 when it be more than two dollar a minute India have still have a regulate phone system and so do we it be surprisingly non innovative move very slowly but then there be just so much fiber out there you could not hold back and look how quickly the price fall it be seven cent a minute in many case and the consequence of cheap phone call free phone call to India be the piss off programmer be the outsource it be probably one of the most dramatic shift in globalization and one of the most powerful economic tool that we be see in we world today the force of India and then China and any other country that can contact we market and will work with we company because the communication be free be just begin to be feel and I think that be probably one of the most important technology trend that we be look at today thank you
