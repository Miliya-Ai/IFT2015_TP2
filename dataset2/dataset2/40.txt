walk around for four month with three wish and all the idea will start to percolate up I think everybody should do it think that you have get three wish and what would you do it be actually a great exercise to really drill down to the thing that you feel be important and really reflect on the world around we and think that can a individual actually do something or come up with something that may actually get some traction out there and make a difference inspire by nature that be the theme here and I think quite frankly that be where I start I become very interested in the landscape as a Canadian we have this great north and there be a pretty small population and my father be a avid outdoorsman so I really have a chance to experience that and I could never really understand exactly what it be or how it be inform I but what I think it be tell I be that we be this transient thing that be happen and that the nature that you see out there the untouched shoreline the untouched forest that I be able to see really bring in a sense of that geological time that this have go on for a long time and we be experience it in a different way and that to I be a reference point that I think I need to have to be able to make the work that I do and I do go out and I do this picture of grass come through in the spring along a roadside this rebirth of grass and then I go out for year try to photograph the pristine landscape but as a fine art photographer I somehow feel that it would not catch on out there that there would be a problem with try to make this as a fine art career and I keep be suck into this genre of the calendar picture or something of that nature and I could not get away from it so I start to think of how can I rethink the landscape I decide to rethink the landscape as the landscape that we have transform I have a bit of a epiphany be lose in Pennsylvania and I take a left turn try to get back to the highway and I end up in a town call Frackville I get out of the car and I stand up and it be a coal mining town I do a 360 turnaround and that become one of the most surreal landscape I have ever see totally transform by man and that get I to go out and look at mine like this and go out and look at the large industrial incursion in the landscape that I could find and that become the baseline of what I be do and it also become the theme that I feel that I could hold onto and not have to be invent myself that this theme be large enough to become a life work to become something that I could sink my tooth into and just research and find out where this industry be and I think one of the thing I also want to say in my thanks which I kind of miss be to thank all the corporation who help I get in because it take negotiation for almost every one of this photograph to get into that place to make that photograph and if it be not for that person let I in at the head of that corporation I would have never make this body of work so in that respect to I I be not against the corporation I own a corporation I work with they and I feel that we all need they and they be important but I be also for sustainability so there be this thing that be pull I in both direction and I be not make a indictment towards what be happen here but it be a slow progression so I start think well we live in all this age of man the Stone Age and the Iron Age and the copper age and this age of man be still at work today but we have become totally disconnect from they there be something that we be not see there and it be a scary thing as well because when we start look at the collective appetite for we lifestyle and what we be do to that landscape that to I be something that be a very sobering moment for I to contemplate and through my photograph I be hope to be able to engage the audience of my work and to come up to it and not immediately be reject by the image not to say oh my God what be it but to be challenge by it to say wow this be beautiful on one level but on the other level this be scary I should not be enjoy it like a forbidden pleasure and it be that forbid pleasure that I think be what resonate out there and it get person to look at this thing and it get person to enter it and it also in a way define kind of what I feel too that I be draw to have a good life I want a house and I want a car but there be this consequence out there and how do I begin to have that attraction repulsion it be even in my own conscience I be have it and here in my work I be try to build that same toggle this thing that I photograph this tire pile here have 45 million tire in it it be the large one it be only about a hour and a half away from I and it catch fire about four year ago it be around Westley California around Modesto and I decide to start look at something that to I have if the early work of look at the landscape have a sense of lament to what we be do to nature in the recycling work that you be see here be start to point to a direction to I it be we redemption that in the recycling work that I be do I be look for a practice a human activity that be sustainable that if we keep put thing through industrial and urban existence back into the system if we keep do that we can continue on of course listen at the conference there be many many thing that be come Bio mimicry and there be many other thing that be come on stream nanotechnology that may also prevent we from have to go into that landscape and tear it apart and we all look forward to that thing but in the meantime this thing be scale up this thing be continue to happen what you be look at here I go to Bangladesh so I start to move away from North America I start to look at we world globally this image of Bangladesh come out of a radio program I be listen to they be talk about Exxon Valdez and that there be go to be a glut of oil tanker because of the insurance industry and that that oil tanker need to be decommission and 2004 be go to be the pinnacle and I think my God would not that be something to see the large vessel of man be deconstruct by hand literally in third world country so originally I be go to go to India and I be shut out of India because of a Greenpeace situation there and then I be able to get into Bangladesh and see for the first time a third world a view of it that I have never actually think be possible 130 million person live in a area the size of Wisconsin person everywhere the pollution be intense and the working condition be horrible here you be look at some oil field in California some of the big oil field and again I start to think that there be another epiphany that the whole world I be live in be a result of have plentiful oil and that to I be again something that I start build on and I continue to build on so this be a series I be hope to have ready in about two or three year under the heading of the Oil Party because I think everything that we be involve in we clothing we car we road and everything be directly a result I be go to move to some picture of China and for I China I start photograph it four year ago and China truly be a question of sustainability in my mind not to mention that China as well have a great effect on the industry that I grow up around I come out of a blue collar town a GM town and my father work at GM so I be very familiar with that kind of industry and that also inform my work but you know to see China and the scale at which it be evolve be quite something so what you see here be the three Gorges Dam and this be the large dam by 50 percent ever attempt by man most of the engineer around the world leave the project because they say it be just too big in fact when it do actually fill with water a year and a half ago they be able to measure a wobble within the earth as it be spin it take fifteen day to fill it so this create a reservoir 600 kilometer long one of the large reservoir ever create and what be also one of the big project around that be move 13 full size city up out of the reservoir and flatten all the building so they could make way for the ship this be a before and after so that be before and this be like 10 week later demolish by hand I think 11 of the building they use dynamite everything else be by hand that be 10 week later and this give you a idea and it be all the person who live in that home be the one that be actually take it apart and work and get pay per brick to take they city apart and this be some of the image from that so I spend about three trip to the Three Gorges Dam look at that massive transformation of a landscape and it look like a bomb out landscape but it be not what it be it be a landscape that be a intentional one this be a need for power and they be willing to go through this massive transformation on this scale to get that power and again it be actually a relief for what be go on in China because I think on the table right now there be 27 nuclear power station to be build there have not be one build in North America for 20 year because of the NIMBY problem not in my BackYard but in China they be say no we be put in 27 in the next 10 year and coal burn furnace be go in there for hydroelectric power literally weekly so coal itself be probably one of the large problem and one of the other thing that happen in the three Gorges a lot of the agricultural land that you see there on the left be also lose some of the most fertile agricultural land be lose in that and 1 2 to 2 million person be relocate depend on whose statistics you be look at and this be what they be build this be Wushan one of the large city that be relocate this be the town hall for the city and again the rebuilding of the city to I it be sad to see that they do not really grab a lot of I guess what we know here in term of urban planning there be no park there be no green space very high density live on the side of a hill and here they have a chance to rebuild city from the bottom up but somehow be not connect with they here be a sign that translate say obey the birth control law build we science civilized and advanced idea of marriage and give birth so here if you look at this poster it have all the trappings of western culture you be see the tuxedo the bouquet but what be really to I frightening about the picture and about this billboard be the refinery in the background so it be like marry up all the thing that we have and it be a adaptation of we way of life full stop and again when you start see that kind of embrace and you start look at they lead they rural lifestyle with a very very small footprint and move into a urban lifestyle with a much high footprint it start to become very sobering this be a shot in one of the big square in Guangdong and this be where a lot of migrant worker be come in from the country and there be about 130 million person in migration try to get into urban center at all time and in the next 10 to 15 year be expect another 400 to 500 million person to migrate into the urban center like Shanghai and the manufacturing center the manufacturer be the domestic be usually you can tell a domestic factory by the fact that they all use the same color uniform so this be a pink uniform at this factory it be a shoe factory and they have dorm for the worker so they bring they in from the country and put they up in the dorm this be one of the big shoe factory the Yuyuan shoe factory near Shenzhen it have 90 000 employee make shoe this be a shift change one of three there be two factory of this scale in the same town this be one with 45 000 so every lunch there be about 12 000 come through for lunch they sit down they have about 20 minute the next round come in it be a incredible workforce that be build there Shanghai I be look at the urban renewal in Shanghai and this be a whole area that will be flatten and turn into skyscraper in the next five year what be also happen in Shanghai be China be change because this would not have happen five year ago for instance this be a holdout they be call dengzahoo they be like pin tack to the ground they will not move they be not negotiate they be not get enough so they be not go to move and so they be hold off until they get a deal with they and they have be actually quite successful in get good deal because most of they be get a raw deal they be be put out about two hour the community that have be around for literally hundred of year or maybe even thousand of year be be break up and spread across in the suburban area outside of Shanghai but this be a whole series of guy hold out in this reconstruction of Shanghai probably the large urban renewal project I think ever attempt on the planet and then the embrace of the thing that they be replace it with again one of my wish and I never end up go there be to somehow tell they that there be good way to build a house the kind of collision of style and thing be quite something and this be call the villa and also like right now they be just move the scaffolding be still on and this be a e waste area and if you look in the foreground on the big print you would see that the industry they industry they be all recycle so the industry already grow around this new development this be a five level bridge in Shanghai Shanghai be a very intriguing city it be explode on a level that I do not think any city have experience in fact even Shenzhen the economic zone one of the first one 15 year ago be about 100 000 person and today it boast about 10 to 11 million so that give you a idea of the kind of migration and the speed with which this be just the taxis be build by Volkswagen there be 9 000 of they here and they be be build for most of the big city Beijing and Shanghai Shenzhen and this be not even the domestic car market this be the taxi market and what we would see here as a suburban development a similar thing but they be all high rise so they will put 20 or 40 up at a time and they just go up in the same way as a single family dwell would go up here in a area and the density be quite incredible and one of the thing in this picture that I want to point out be that when I see this kind of building I be shocked to see that they be not use a central air conditioning system every window have a air conditioner in it and I be sure there be person here who probably know good than I do about efficiency but I can not imagine that every apartment have its own air conditioner be a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale and when you start look at that and then you start factoring up into a city the size of Shanghai it be literally a forest of skyscraper it be breathtaking in term of the speed at which this city be transform and you can see in the foreground of this picture it be still one of the last area that be be hold up right now that be all clear out this be do about eight month ago and high rise be now go up into that central spot so a skyscraper be build literally overnight in Shanghai Most recently I go in and I start look at some of the big industry in China and this be Baosteel right outside of Shanghai this be the coal supply for the steel factory 18 square kilometer it be a incredibly massive operation I think 15 000 worker five cupola and the sixth one come in here so they be build very large blast furnace to try to deal with the demand for steel in China so this be three of the visible blast furnace within that shot and again look at this image there be this constant like haze that you be see this be go to show you real time a assembler it be a circuit breaker 10 hour a day at this speed I think one of the issue that we here be face with China be that they be use a lot of the late production technology in that one there be 400 person that work on the floor and I ask the manager to point out five of you fast producer and then I go and look at each one of they for about 15 or 20 minute and pick this one woman and it be just lightning fast the way she be work be almost unbelievable but that be the trick that they have get right now that they be win with be that they be use all the late technology and extrusion machine and bring all the component into play but the assembly be where they be actually bring in the country worker be very willing to work they want to work there be a massive backlog of person want they job that condition be go to be there for the next 10 to 15 year if they realize what they want which be you know 400 to 500 million more person come into the city in this particular case this be the assembly line that you see this be a shot of it I have to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field I have to have they freeze for 10 second to get this shot it take I five fake try because they be just go to slow they down be literally impossible they be just wind up do this thing all day long until the manager have to with a stern voice say okay everybody freeze it be not too bad but they be drive to produce this thing at a incredible rate this be a textile mill do synthetic silk a oil byproduct and what you be see here be again one of the most state of the art textile mill there be 500 of this machine they be worth about 200 000 dollar each so you have about 12 person run this and they be just inspect it and they be just walk the line the machine be all run absolutely incredible to see what the scale of industry be and I start get in further and further into the factory and that be a diptych I do a lot of pairing to try and get the sense of scale in this place this be a line where they get the thread and they wind the thread together pre go into the textile mill here be something that be far more labor intensive which be the making of shoe this floor have about 1 500 worker on this floor the company itself have about 10 000 employee and they be do domestic shoe it be very hard to get into the international company because I have to get permission from company like Nike and Adidas and that be very hard to get and they do not want to let I in but the domestic be much easy to do it just give you a sense of again and that be where really the whole migration of job start go over to China and make the shoe Nike be one of the early one it be such a high labor component to it that it make a lot of sense to go after that labor market this be a high tech mobile phone bird mobile phone one of the large mobile maker in China I think mobile phone company be pop up literally on a weekly basis and they have a explosive growth in mobile phone this be a textile where they be do shirt Youngor the big shirt factory and clothing factory in China and this next shot here be one of the lunchroom everything be very efficient while set up this shoot person on average would spend eight to 10 minute have a lunch this be one of the big factory I have ever see they make coffeemaker here the big coffeemaker and the big iron maker they make 20 million of they in the world there be 21 000 employee this one factory and they have several of they be half a kilometer long this be just recently shoot I just come back about a month ago so you be the first one to be see this this new factory picture I have take so it be take I almost a year to gain access into this place the other aspect of what be happen in China be that there be a real need for material there so a lot of the recycled material that be collect here be be recycle and take to China by ship that be cube metal this be armature electrical armature where they be get the copper and the high end steel from electrical motor out and recycle they this be certainly connect to California and Silicon Valley but this be what happen to most of the computer fifty percent of the world computer end up in China to be recycle it be refer to as e waste there and it be a bit of a problem the way they recycle the board be that they actually use the coal briquette which be use all through China but they heat up the board and with pair of pliers they pull off all the component they be try to get all the value metal out of that component but the toxic smell when you come into a town that be actually do this kind of burning of the board you can smell it a good five or 10 kilometer before you get there here be another operation it be all cottage industry so it be not big place it be all in person front porch in they backyard even in they home they be burn board if there be a concern for somebody come by because it be consider in China to be illegal do it but they can not stop the product from come in this portrait I be not usually know for portrait but I could not resist this one where she be be through Mao and she be be through the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution and now she be sit on she porch with this e waste beside she it be quite something this be a road where it be be shore up by computer board in one of the big town where they be recycle so that be the photograph that I want to show you applause I want to dedicate my wish to my two girl they have be sit on my shoulder the whole time while I have be think one Megan the one of the right and Katja there and to I the whole notion the thing I be photograph be out of a great concern about the scale of we progress and what we call progress and as much as there be great thing around the corner and it be palpable in this room of all of the thing that be just about to break that can solve so many problem I be really hope that that thing will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect and it be not something that be not just affect we world but it start to go up because I think we can start correct we footprint and bring it down but there be a grow footprint that be happen in Asia and be grow at a rapid rapid rate and so I do not think we can equalize it so ultimately the strategy I think here be that we have to be very concerned about they evolution because it be go to be connect to we evolution as well so part of my thinking and part of my wish be sit with this thought in mind and think about how be they life go to be when they want to have child or when they be ready to get married 20 year from now or whatever 15 year from now and to I that have be the core behind most of my thinking in my work and also for this incredible chance to have some wish wish one world change I want to use my image to persuade million of person to join in the global conversation on sustainability and it be through communication today that I believe that that be not a unreal idea oh and I go in search I want to put what I have in mind hitch it onto something I do not want a wish just to start from nowhere one of they I be start from almost nothing but the other one I want to find out what be go on that be work right now and worldchange com be a fantastic blog and that blog be now be visit by close to half a million person a month and it just start about 14 month ago and the beauty of what be go on there be that the tone of the conversation be the tone that I like what they be do there be that they be not I think the environmental movement have fail in that it be use the stick too much it be use the apocalyptic tone too much it have not sell the positive aspect of be environmentally concerned and try to pull we out whereas this conversation that be go on in this blog be about positive movement about how to change we world in a good way quickly and it be look at technology and it be look at new energy save device and it be look at how to rethink and how to be strategize the movement towards sustainability and so for I one of the thing that I think would be to put some of my work in the service of promote the worldchanging com website some of you might know he be a tedster Stephen Sagmeister and I be work on some layout and this be still in preliminary stage this be not the final but this image with worldchanging com can be place into any kind of media they could be post through the web they could be use as a billboard or a bus shelter or anything of that nature so we be look at this as try to build out and what we end up discuss be that in most media you get mostly a image with a lot of text and the text be blast all over what be unusual accord to Stephen be less than five percent of ad be actually lead with image and so in this case because it be about a lot of this image and what they represent and the kind of question they bring up that we think let the image play out and bring someone to say well what be Worldchanging com with this image have to do and hopefully inspire person to go to that website so worldchange com and building that blog and it be a blog and I be hope that it be not I do not see it as the kind of blog where we be all go to follow each other to death this one be one that will speak out and will go out and to start reach because right now there be conversation in India in China in South America there be entry come from all around the world I think there be a chance to have a dialogue a conversation about sustainability at worldchanging com and anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic Wish two be more of the bottom up ground up one that I be try to work with and this one be I wish to launch a groundbreaking competition that motivate kid to invest idea on and invent idea on sustainability and one of the thing that come out Allison who actually nominate I say something early on in a brainstorming she say that recycling in Canada have a fantastic entry into we psyche through kid between grade four and six and you think about it you know grade four my wife and I we say age seven be the age of reason so they be into the age of reason and they be pre puberty so it be this great window where they actually be you can influence they you know what happen at puberty you know we know that from early presentation so my thinking here be that we try to motivate that kid to start drive home idea let they understand what sustainability be and that they have a vested interest in it to happen and one of the way I think of do it be to use my prize so I would take 30 000 or 40 000 dollar of the winnings and the rest be go to be to manage this project but to use that as prize for kid to get into they hand but the other thing that I think would be fantastic be to create this call they prize target and so one could be for the good sustainable idea for a in school project the good one for a household project or it could be the good community project for sustainability and I also think there should be a nice prize for the good artwork for in my World and what would happen it be a scalable thing and if we can get person to put in thing whether it be equipment like a media lab or money to make the prize significant enough and to open it up to all the school that be public school or school that be with kid that age and make it a wide open competition for they to go after that prize and to submit they and the prize have to be a verifiable thing so it be not about just idea the art piece be about the idea and how they present they and do they but the actual thing have to be verifiable in that way what be happen be that we be motivate a certain age group to start think and they be go to push that up from the bottom up into I believe into the household and parent will be react to it and try to help they with the project and I think it start to motivate the whole idea towards sustainability in a very positive way and start to teach they they know about recycle now but they do not really I think get sustainability in all the thing and the energy footprint and how that matter and to teach they to I would be a fantastic wish and it would be something that I would certainly put my shoulder into and again in in my World the competition we would use the artwork that come in from that competition to promote it and I like the word in my world because it give possession of the world to the person who be do it it be my world it be not someone else I want to help it I want to do something with it so I think it have a great opportunity to engage the imagination and great idea I think come from kid and engage they imagination into a project and do something for school I think all school could use extra equipment extra cash it be go to be a incentive for they to do that and this be some of the idea in term of where we could possibly put in some promotion for in my World and wish three be imax film so I be tell I should do one for myself and I have always want to actually get involve with do something and the scale of my work and the kind of idea I be play with when I first see a Imax film I almost immediately think there be a real resonance between what I be try to do and the scale of what I try to do as a photographer and I think there be a real possibility to reach new audience if I have a chance so I be look really for a mentor because I just have my birthday I be 50 and I do not have time to go back to school right now I be too busy so I need somebody who can put I on a quick catch up course on how to do something like that and lead I through the maze of how one do something like this that would be fantastic so that be my three wish applause
