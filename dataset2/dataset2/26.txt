my title Queerer than we can suppose the strangeness of science Queerer than we can suppose come from J B S Haldane the famous biologist who say now my own suspicion be that the universe be not only queer than we suppose but queer than we can suppose I suspect that there be more thing in heaven and earth than be dream of or can be dream of in any philosophy Richard Feynman compare the accuracy of quantum theory experimental prediction to specify the width of North America to within one hair breadth of accuracy this mean that quantum theory have get to be in some sense true yet the assumption that quantum theory need to make in order to deliver that prediction be so mysterious that even Feynman himself be move to remark if you think you understand quantum theory you do not understand quantum theory it be so queer that physicist resort to one or another paradoxical interpretation of it David Deutsch who be talk here in the fabric of reality embrace the many world interpretation of quantum theory because the bad that you can say about it be that it be preposterously wasteful it postulate a vast and rapidly grow number of universe exist in parallel mutually undetectable except through the narrow porthole of quantum mechanical experiment and that be Richard Feynman the biologist Lewis Wolpert believe that the queerness of modern physics be just a extreme example science as oppose to technology do violence to common sense every time you drink a glass of water he point out the odds be that you will imbibe at least one molecule that pass through the bladder of Oliver Cromwell laughter it be just elementary probability theory laughter the number of molecule per glassful be hugely great than the number of glassful or bladdersful in the world and of course there be nothing special about Cromwell or bladder you have just breathe in a nitrogen atom that pass through the right lung of the third iguanodon to the left of the tall cycad tree queerer than we can suppose what be it that make we capable of suppose anything and do this tell we anything about what we can suppose be there thing about the universe that will be forever beyond we grasp but not beyond the grasp of some superior intelligence be there thing about the universe that be in principle ungraspable by any mind however superior the history of science have be one long series of violent brainstorm as successive generation have come to term with increase level of queerness in the universe we be now so used to the idea that the Earth spin rather than the Sun move across the sky it be hard for we to realize what a shatter mental revolution that must have be after all it seem obvious that the Earth be large and motionless the Sun small and mobile but it be worth recall Wittgenstein remark on the subject tell I he ask a friend why do person always say it be natural for man to assume that the Sun go round the Earth rather than that the Earth be rotate and he friend reply well obviously because it just look as though the Sun be go round the Earth Wittgenstein reply well what would it have look like if it have look as though the Earth be rotate laughter Science have teach we against all intuition that apparently solid thing like crystal and rock be really almost entirely compose of empty space and the familiar illustration be the nucleus of a atom be a fly in the middle of a sport stadium and the next atom be in the next sport stadium so it would seem the hard solidest dense rock be really almost entirely empty space break only by tiny particle so widely space they should not count why then do rock look and feel solid and hard and impenetrable as a evolutionary biologist I would say this we brain have evolve to help we survive within the order of magnitude of size and speed which we body operate at we never evolve to navigate in the world of atom if we have we brain probably would perceive rock as full of empty space Rocks feel hard and impenetrable to we hand precisely because object like rock and hand can not penetrate each other it be therefore useful for we brain to construct notion like solidity and impenetrability because such notion help we to navigate we body through the middle sized world in which we have to navigate move to the other end of the scale we ancestor never have to navigate through the cosmos at speed close to the speed of light if they have we brain would be much good at understand Einstein I want to give the name Middle World to the medium scaled environment in which we have evolve the ability to take act nothing to do with Middle Earth Middle World laughter we be evolve denizen of Middle World and that limit what we be capable of imagine we find it intuitively easy to grasp idea like when a rabbit move at the sort of medium velocity at which rabbit and other Middle World object move and hit another Middle World object like a rock it knock itself out may I introduce Major General Albert Stubblebine III commander of military intelligence in 1983 he stare at he wall in Arlington Virginia and decide to do it as frightening as the prospect be he be go into the next office he stand up and move out from behind he desk what be the atom mostly make of he think space he start walk what be I mostly make of atom he quicken he pace almost to a jog now what be the wall mostly make of laughter atom all I have to do be merge the space then General Stubblebine bang he nose hard on the wall of he office Stubblebine who command 16 000 soldier be confound by he continual failure to walk through the wall he have no doubt that this ability will one day be a common tool in the military arsenal who would screw around with a army that could do that that be from a article in Playboy which I be read the other day laughter I have every reason to think it be true I be read Playboy because I myself have a article in it laughter unaided human intuition school in Middle World find it hard to believe Galileo when he tell we a heavy object and a light object air friction aside would hit the ground at the same instant and that be because in Middle World air friction be always there if we have evolve in a vacuum we would expect they to hit the ground simultaneously if we be bacterium constantly buffet by thermal movement of molecule it would be different but we Middle Worlders be too big to notice brownian motion in the same way we life be dominate by gravity but be almost oblivious to the force of surface tension a small insect would reverse this priority Steve Grand he be the one on the left Douglas Adams be on the right Steve Grand in he book Creation Life and how to make it be positively scathing about we preoccupation with matter itself we have this tendency to think that only solid material thing be really thing at all wave of electromagnetic fluctuation in a vacuum seem unreal Victorian think the wave have to be wave in some material medium the ether but we find real matter comfort only because we have evolve to survive in Middle World where matter be a useful fiction a whirlpool for Steve Grand be a thing with just as much reality as a rock in a desert plain in Tanzania in the shadow of the volcano Ol Doinyo Lengai there be a dune make of volcanic ash the beautiful thing be that it move bodily it be what be technically know as a barchan and the entire dune walk across the desert in a westerly direction at a speed of about 17 meter per year it retain its crescent shape and move in the direction of the horn what happen be that the wind blow the sand up the shallow slope on the other side and then as each sand grain hit the top of the ridge it cascade down on the inside of the crescent and so the whole horn shape dune move Steve Grand point out that you and I be ourselves more like a wave than a permanent thing he invite we the reader to think of a experience from you childhood something you remember clearly something you can see feel maybe even smell as if you be really there after all you really be there at the time be not you how else would you remember it but here be the bombshell you be not there not a single atom that be in you body today be there when that event take place Matter flow from place to place and momentarily come together to be you whatever you be therefore you be not the stuff of which you be make if that do not make the hair stand up on the back of you neck read it again until it do because it be important so really be not a word that we should use with simple confidence if a neutrino have a brain which it evolve in neutrino sized ancestor it would say that rock really do consist of empty space we have brain that evolve in medium sized ancestor which could not walk through rock really for a animal be whatever its brain need it to be in order to assist its survival and because different species live in different world there will be a discomforting variety of really what we see of the real world be not the unvarnished world but a model of the world regulate and adjust by sense datum but construct so it be useful for deal with the real world the nature of the model depend on the kind of animal we be a fly animal need a different kind of model from a walk climbing or swimming animal a monkey brain must have software capable of simulate a three dimensional world of branch and trunk a mole software for construct model of its world will be customize for underground use a water strider brain do not need 3d software at all since it live on the surface of the pond in a Edwin Abbott flatland I have speculate that bat may see color with they ear the world model that a bat need in order to navigate through three dimension catch insect must be pretty similar to the world model that any fly bird a day fly bird like a swallow need to perform the same kind of task the fact that the bat use echo in pitch darkness to input the current variable to its model while the swallow use light be incidental bat I have even suggest use perceive hue such as red and blue as label internal label for some useful aspect of echo perhaps the acoustic texture of surface furry or smooth and so on in the same way as swallow or indeed we use that perceive hue redness and blueness etc to label long and short wavelength of light there be nothing inherent about red that make it long wavelength the point be that the nature of the model be govern by how it be to be use rather than by the sensory modality involve J B S Haldane himself have something to say about animal whose world be dominate by smell dog can distinguish two very similar fatty acid extremely dilute caprylic acid and caproic acid the only difference you see be that one have a extra pair of carbon atom in the chain Haldane guess that a dog would probably be able to place the acid in the order of they molecular weight by they smell just as a man could place a number of piano wire in the order of they length by means of they note now there be another fatty acid capric acid which be just like the other two except that it have two more carbon atom a dog that have never meet capric acid would perhaps have no more trouble imagine its smell than we would have trouble imagine a trumpet say play one note high than we have hear a trumpet play before perhaps dog and rhino and other smell orient animal smell in color and the argument would be exactly the same as for the bat Middle World the range of size and speed which we have evolve to feel intuitively comfortable with be a bit like the narrow range of the electromagnetic spectrum that we see as light of various color we be blind to all frequency outside that unless we use instrument to help we Middle World be the narrow range of reality which we judge to be normal as oppose to the queerness of the very small the very large and the very fast we could make a similar scale of improbability nothing be totally impossible miracle be just event that be extremely improbable a marble statue could wave its hand at we the atom that make up its crystalline structure be all vibrate back and forth anyway because there be so many of they and because there be no agreement among they in they preferred direction of movement the marble as we see it in Middle World stay rock steady but the atom in the hand could all just happen to move the same way at the same time and again and again in this case the hand would move and we would see it wave at we in Middle World the odds against it of course be so great that if you set out write zero at the time of the origin of the universe you still would not have write enough zero to this day evolution in Middle World have not equip we to handle very improbable event we do not live long enough in the vastness of astronomical space and geological time that which seem impossible in Middle World might turn out to be inevitable one way to think about that be by count planet we do not know how many planet there be in the universe but a good estimate be about 10 to the 20 or 100 billion billion and that give we a nice way to express we estimate of life improbability we could make some sort of landmark point along a spectrum of improbability which might look like the electromagnetic spectrum we just look at if life have arise only once on any life could originate once per planet could be extremely common or it could originate once per star or once per galaxy or maybe only once in the entire universe in which case it would have to be here and somewhere up there would be the chance that a frog would turn into a prince and similar magical thing like that if life have arise on only one planet in the entire universe that planet have to be we planet because here we be talk about it and that mean that if we want to avail ourselves of it we be allow to postulate chemical event in the origin of life which have a probability as low as one in 100 billion billion I do not think we shall have to avail ourselves of that because I suspect that life be quite common in the universe and when I say quite common it could still be so rare that no one island of life ever encounter another which be a sad thought how shall we interpret queer than we can suppose queer than can in principle be suppose or just queer than we can suppose give the limitation of we brain evolutionary apprenticeship in Middle World could we by training and practice emancipate ourselves from Middle World and achieve some sort of intuitive as well as mathematical understanding of the very small and the very large I genuinely do not know the answer I wonder whether we might help ourselves to understand say quantum theory if we bring up child to play computer game begin in early childhood which have a make believe world of ball go through two slit on a screen a world in which the strange going on of quantum mechanic be enlarge by the computer make believe so that they become familiar on the Middle World scale of the stream and similarly a relativistic computer game in which object on the screen manifest the Lorentz contraction and so on to try to get ourselves to get child into the way of think about it I want to end by apply the idea of Middle World to we perception of each other most scientist today subscribe to a mechanistic view of the mind we be the way we be because we brain be wire up as they be we hormone be the way they be we would be different we character would be different if we neuro anatomy and we physiological chemistry be different but we scientist be inconsistent if we be consistent we response to a misbehaving person like a child murderer should be something like this unit have a faulty component it need repair that be not what we say what we say and I include the most austerely mechanistic among we which be probably I what we say be vile monster prison be too good for you or bad we seek revenge in all probability thereby trigger the next phase in a escalate cycle of counter revenge which we see of course all over the world today in short when we be think like academic we regard person as elaborate and complicated machine like computer or car but when we revert to be human we behave more like Basil Fawlty who we remember thrash he car to teach it a lesson when it would not start on Gourmet night laughter the reason we personify thing like car and computer be that just as monkey live in a arboreal world and mole live in a underground world and water strider live in a surface tension dominate flatland we live in a social world we swim through a sea of person a social version of Middle World we be evolve to second guess the behavior of other by become brilliant intuitive psychologist treat person as machine may be scientifically and philosophically accurate but it be a cumbersome waste of time if you want to guess what this person be go to do next the economically useful way to model a person be to treat he as a purposeful goal seek agent with pleasure and pain desire and intention guilt blame worthiness personification and the imputing of intentional purpose be such a brilliantly successful way to model human it be hardly surprising the same modeling software often seize control when we be try to think about entity for which it be not appropriate like Basil Fawlty with he car or like million of delude person with the universe as a whole laughter if the universe be queer than we can suppose be it just because we have be naturally select to suppose only what we need to suppose in order to survive in the Pleistocene of Africa or be we brain so versatile and expandable that we can train ourselves to break out of the box of we evolution or finally be there some thing in the universe so queer that no philosophy of being however godlike could dream they thank you very much applause
