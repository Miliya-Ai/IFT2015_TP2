so anyway who be I I usually say to person when they say what do you do I say I do hardware because it sort of conveniently encompass everything I do and I recently say that to a venture capitalist casually at some Valley event to which he reply how quaint laughter and I sort of really be dumbstruck and I really should have say something smart and now I have have a little bit of time to think about it I would have say well you know if we look at the next 100 year and we have see all this problem in the last few day most of the big issue clean water clean energy and they be interchangeable in some respects and clean more functional material they all look to I to be hardware problem this do not mean we should ignore software or information or computation and that be in fact probably what I be go to try and tell you about so this talk be go to be about how do we make thing and what be the new way that we be go to make thing in the future now TED send you a lot of spam if you be a speaker about do this do that and you fill out all this form and you do not actually know how they be go to describe you and it flash across my desk that they be go to introduce I as a futurist and I have always be nervous about the term futurist because you seem doom to failure because you can not really predict it and I be laugh about this with the very smart colleague I have and say you know well if I have to talk about the future what be it and George Homsey a great guy say oh the future be amazing it be so much stranger than you think we be go to reprogram the bacterium in you gut and we be go to make you poo smell like peppermint laughter so you may think that be sort of really crazy but there be some pretty amazing thing that be happen that make this possible so this be not my work but it be work of good friend of mine at MIT this be call the registry of standard biological part this be head by Drew Endy and Tom Knight and a few other very very bright individual basically what they be do be look at biology as a programmable system literally think of proteins as subroutine that you can string together to execute a program now this be actually become such a interesting idea this be a state diagram that be a extremely simple computer this one be a two bit counter so that be essentially the computational equivalent of two light switch and this be be build by a group of student at Zurich for a design competition in biology and from the result of the same competition last year a University of Texas team of student program bacterium so that they can detect light and switch on and off so this be interesting in the sense that you can now do if then for statement in material in structure this be a pretty interesting trend because we use to live in a world where everyone be say glibly form follow function but I think I have sort of grow up in a world you listen to Neil Gershenfeld yesterday I be in a lab associate with he where it be really a world where information define form and function I spend six year think about that but to show you the power of art over science this be actually one of the cartoon I write this be call HowToons I work with a fabulous illustrator call Nick Dragotta take I six year at MIT and about that many page to describe what I be do and it take he one page and so this be we muse Tucker he be a interesting little kid and he sister Celine and what he be do here be observe the self assembly of he Cheerios in he cereal bowl and in fact you can program the self assembly of thing so he start chocolate dip edge change the hydrophobicity and the hydrophylicity in theory if you program that sufficiently you should be able to do something pretty interesting and make a very complex structure in this case he be do self replication of a complex 3d structure and that be what I think about for a long time because this be how we currently make thing this be a silicon wafer and essentially that be just a whole bunch of layer of two dimensional stuff sort of layer up the feature side be you know person will say unclear down around about 65 nanometer now on the right that be a radiolara that be a unicellular organism ubiquitous in the ocean and that have feature size down to about 20 nanometer and it be a complex 3d structure we could do a lot more with computer and thing generally if we know how to build thing this way the secret to biology be it build computation into the way it make thing so this little thing here polymerase be essentially a supercomputer design for replicate dna and the ribosome here be another little computer that help in the translation of the proteins I think about this in the sense that it be great to build in biological material but can we do similar thing can we get self replicate type behavior can we get complex 3d structure automatically assemble in inorganic system because there be some advantage to inorganic system like high speed semiconductor etc so this be some of my work on how do you do a autonomously self replicate system and this be sort of Babbage revenge this be little mechanical computer this be five state state machine so that be about three light switch line up in a neutral state they will not bind at all now if I make a string of this a bit string they will be able to replicate so we start with white blue blue white that encode that will now copy from one come two and then from two come three and so you have get this sort of replicate system it be work actually by Lionel Penrose father of Roger Penrose the tile guy he do a lot of this work in the 60 and so a lot of this logic theory lay fallow as we go down the digital computer revolution but it be now come back so now I be go to show you the hand free autonomous self replication so we have track in the video the input string which be green green yellow yellow green we set they off on this air hockey table you know high science use air hockey table laughter and if you watch this thing long enough you get dizzy but what you be actually see be copy of that original string emerge from the part bin that you have here so we have get autonomous replication of bit string so why would you want to replicate bit string well it turn out biology have this other very interesting meme that you can take a linear string which be a convenient thing to copy and you can fold that into a arbitrarily complex 3d structure so I be try to you know take the engineer version can we build a mechanical system in inorganic material that will do the same thing so what I be show you here be that we can make a 2d shape the b assemble from a string of component that follow extremely simple rule and the whole point of go with the extremely simple rule here and the incredibly simple state machine in the previous design be that you do not need digital logic to do computation and that way you can scale thing much small than microchip so you can literally use this as the tiny component in the assembly process so Neil Gershenfeld show you this video on Wednesday I believe but I will show you again this be literally the color sequence of that tile each different color have a different magnetic polarity and the sequence be uniquely specify the structure that be come out now hopefully that of you who know anything about graph theory can look at that and that will satisfy you that that can also do arbitrary 3d structure and in fact you know I can now take a dog carve it up and then reassemble it so it be a linear string that will fold from a sequence and now I can actually define that three dimensional object as a sequence of bit so you know it be a pretty interesting world when you start look at the world a little bit differently and the universe be now a compiler and so I be think about you know what be the program for program the physical universe and how do we think about material and structure sort of as a information and computation problem not just where you attach a micro controller to the end point but that the structure and the mechanism be the logic be the computer have totally absorb this philosophy I start look at a lot of problem a little differently with the universe as a computer you can look at this droplet of water as have perform the computation you set a couple of boundary condition like gravity the surface tension density etc and then you press execute and magically the universe produce you a perfect ball lens so this actually apply to the problem of so there be a half a billion to a billion person in the world do not have access to cheap eyeglass so can you make a machine that could make any prescription lens very quickly on site this be a machine where you literally define a boundary condition if it be circular you make a spherical lens if it be elliptical you can make a astigmatic lens you then put a membrane on that and you apply pressure so that be part of the extra program and literally with only that two input so the shape of you boundary condition and the pressure you can define a infinite number of lens that cover the range of human refractive error from minus 12 to plus eight diopter up to four diopter of cylinder and then literally you now pour on a monomer you know I will do a Julia Childs here this be three minute of uv light and you reverse the pressure on you membrane once you have cook it pop it out I have see this video but I still do not know if it be go to end right laughter so you reverse this this be a very old movie so with the new prototype actually both surface be flexible but this will show you the point now you have finish the lens you literally pop it out that be next year Yves Klein you know eyeglass shape and you can see that that have a mild prescription of about minus two diopter and as I rotate it against this side shoot you will see that that have cylinder and that be program in literally into the physics of the system so this sort of think about structure as computation and structure as information lead to other thing like this this be something that my person at SQUID Labs be work on at the moment call electronic rope so literally you think about a rope it have very complex structure in the weave and under no load it be one structure under a different load it be a different structure and you can actually exploit that by put in a very small number of conduct fiber to actually make it a sensor so this be now a rope that know the load on the rope at any particular point in the rope just by think about the physics of the world material as the computer you can start to do thing like this I be go to segue a little here I guess I be just go to casually tell you the type of thing that I think about with this one thing I be really interested about this right now be how if you be really take this view of the universe as a computer how do we make thing in a very general sense and how might we share the way we make thing in a general sense the same way you share open source hardware and a lot of talk here have espouse the benefit of have lot of person look at problem share the information and work on that thing together so a convenient thing about be a human be you move in linear time and unless Lisa Randall change that we will continue to move in linear time so that mean anything you do or anything you make you produce a sequence of step and I think Lego in the 70 nail this and they do it most elegantly but they can show you how to build thing in sequence so I be think about how can we generalize the way we make all sort of thing so you end up with this sort of guy right and I think this apply across a very broad sort of a lot of concept you know Cameron Sinclair yesterday say how do I get everyone to collaborate on design globally to do housing for humanity and if you have see Amy Smith she talk about how you get student at MIT to work with community in Haiti and I think we have to sort of redefine and rethink how we define structure and material and assembly thing so that we can really share the information on how you do that thing in a more profound way and build on each other source code for structure I do not know exactly how to do this yet but you know it be something be actively think about so you know that lead to question like be this a compiler be this a sub routine interesting thing like that maybe I be get a little too abstract but you know this be the sort of return to we comic character this be sort of the universe or a different universe view that I think be go to be very prevalent in the future from biotech to material assembly it be great to hear Bill Joy they be start to invest in material science but this be the new thing in material science how do we put real information and real structure into new idea and see the world in a different way and it be not go to be binary code that define the computer of the universe it be sort of a analog computer but it be definitely a interesting new worldview I have go too far so that sound like it be it I have probably get a couple of minute of question or I can show I think they also say that I do extreme stuff in the introduction so I may have to explain that so maybe I will do that with this short video so this be actually a 3 000 square foot kite which also happen to be a minimal energy surface so return to the droplet again think about the universe in a new way this be a kite design by a guy call Dave Kulp and why do you want a 3 000 square foot kite so that be a kite the size of you house and so you want that to tow boat very fast so I have be work on this a little also with a couple of other guy but you know this be another way to look at the if you abstract again this be a structure that be define by the physics of the universe you could just hang it as a bed sheet but again the computation of all the physics give you the aerodynamic shape and so you can actually sort of almost double you boat speed with system like that so that be sort of another interesting aspect of the future applause
