in term of invention I would like to tell you the tale of one of my favorite project I think it be one of the most exciting that I be work on but I think it be also the simple it be a project that have the potential to make a huge impact around the world it address one of the big health issue on the planet the number one cause of death in child under five which be Water bear disease Diarrhea Malnutrition No it be breathe the smoke from indoor cooking fire acute respiratory infection cause by this can you believe that I find this shocking and somewhat appalling can not we make clean burn cooking fuel can not we make good stove how be it that this can lead to over two million death every year I know Bill Joy be talk to you about the wonder of carbon nanotube so I be go to talk to you about the wonder of carbon macro tube which be charcoal laughter so this be a picture of rural Haiti Haiti be now 98 percent deforest you will see scene like this all over the island it lead to all sort of environmental problem and problem that affect person throughout the nation a couple year ago there be severe flooding that lead to thousand of death that be directly attributable to the fact that there be no tree on the hill to stabilize the soil so the rain come they go down the river and the flooding happen now one of the reason why there be so few tree be this person need to cook and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it it be not that person be ignorant to the environmental damage they know perfectly well but they have no other choice Fossil fuel be not available and solar energy do not cook the way that they like they food prepare and so this be what they do you will find family like this who go out into the forest to find a tree cut it down and make charcoal out of it so not surprisingly there be a lot of effort that be be do to look at alternative cooking fuel about four year ago I take a team of student down to Haiti and we work with Peace Corps volunteer there this be one such volunteer and this be a device that he have build in the village where he work and the idea be that you could take waste paper you could compress it and make briquette that could be use for fuel but this device be very slow so we engineering student go to work on it and with some very simple change they be able to triple the throughput of this device so you could imagine they be very excited about it and they take the briquette back to MIT so that they could test they and one of the thing that they find be they do not burn so it be a little discouraging to the student laughter and in fact if you look closely right here you can see it say US Peace Corps as it turn out there actually be not any waste paper in this village and while it be a good use of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it back with he to he village it be 800 kilometer away and so we think perhaps there might be a good way to come up with a alternative cooking fuel what we want to do be we want to make a fuel that use something that be readily available on the local level you see this all over Haiti as well they be small scale sugar mill and the waste product from they after you extract the juice from the sugarcane be call bagasse it have no other use it have no nutritional value so they do not feed it to the animal it just sit in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it what we want to do be we want to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that person could easily cook with something like charcoal so over the next couple of year student and I work to develop a process so you start with the bagasse and then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of a waste fifty five gallon oil drum after some time after set it on fire you seal it to restrict the oxygen that go into the kiln and then you end up with this carbonize material here however you can not burn this it be too fine and it burn too quickly to be useful for cook so we have to try to find a way to form it into useful briquette and conveniently one of my student be from Ghana and he remember a dish he mom use to make for he call kokonte which be a very sticky porridge make out of the cassava root and so what we do be we look and we find that cassava be indeed grow in Haiti under the name of manioc in fact it be grow all over the world yucca tapioca manioc cassava it be all the same thing a very starchy root vegetable and you can make a very thick sticky porridge out of it which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquette so we do this we go down to Haiti this be the graduate of the first Ecole de Charbon or Charcoal Institute and this laughter that be right so I be actually a instructor at MIT as well as CIT and this be the briquette that we make now I be go to take you to a different continent this be India and this be the most commonly use cooking fuel in India it be cow dung and more than in Haiti this produce really smoky fire and this be where you see the health impact of cook with cow dung and biomass as a fuel kid and woman be especially affect by it because they be the one who be around the cooking fire so we want to see if we could introduce this charcoal make technology there well unfortunately they do not have sugarcane and they do not have cassava but that do not stop we what we do be we find what be the locally available source of biomass and there be wheat straw and there be rice straw in this area and what we could use as a binder be actually small amount of cow manure which they use ordinarily for they fuel and we do side by side test and here you can see the charcoal briquette and here the cow dung and you can see that it be a lot clean burning of a cooking fuel and in fact it heat the water a lot more quickly and so we be very happy thus far but one of the thing that we find be when we do side by side comparison with wood charcoal it do not burn as long and the briquette crumble a little bit and we lose energy as they fall apart as they be cook so we want to try to find a way to make a strong briquette so that we could compete with wood charcoal in the market in Haiti so we go back to MIT we take out the Instron machine and we figure out what sort of force you need in order to compress a briquette to the level that you actually be get improve performance out of it and at the same time that we have student in the lab look at this we also have community partner in Haiti work to develop the process to improve it and make it more accessible to person in the village there and after some time we develop a low cost press that allow you to produce charcoal which actually now burn not only actually it burn long clean than wood charcoal so now we be in a situation where we have a product which be actually good than what you can buy in Haiti in the marketplace which be a very wonderful place to be in Haiti alone about 30 million tree be cut down every year there be a possibility of this be implement and save a good portion of that in addition the revenue generate from that charcoal be 260 million dollar that be a awful lot for a country like Haiti with a population of eight million and a average income of less than 400 dollar so this be where we be also move ahead with we charcoal project and one of the thing that I think be also interesting be I have a friend up at UC Berkeley who be be do risk analysis and he be look at the problem of the health impact of burn wood versus charcoal and he be find that worldwide you could prevent a million death switch from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel that be remarkable but up until now there be not way to do it without cut down tree but now we have a way that be use a agricultural waste material to create a cooking fuel one of the really exciting thing though be something that come out of the trip that I take to Ghana just last month and I think it be the cool thing and it be even low tech than what you just see if you can imagine such a thing here it be so what be this this be corncob turn into charcoal and the beauty of this be that you do not need to form briquette it come ready make this be my 100 laptop right here and actually like Nick I bring sample laughter so we can pass this around they be fully functional field test ready to roll out laughter and I think one of the thing which be also remarkable about this technology be that the technology transfer be so easy compare to the sugarcane charcoal where we have to teach person how to form it into briquette and you have the extra step of cook the binder this come pre briquett and this be about the most exciting thing in my life right now which be perhaps a sad commentary on my life laughter but once you see it like you guy in the front row all right yeah ok so anyway laughter here it be and this be I think a perfect example of what Robert Wright be talk about in that non zero sum thing so not only do you have health benefit you have environmental benefit but this be one of the incredibly rare situation where you also have economic benefit person can make they own cooking fuel from waste product they can generate income from this they can save the money that they be go to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to person who be not make they own it be really rare that you do not have trade off between health and economics or environment and economics so this be a project that I just find extremely exciting and I be really look forward to see where it take we so when we talk about now the future we will create one of the thing that I think be necessary be to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in and now I do not actually mean the world that we live in I mean the world where woman spend two to three hour everyday grind grain for they family to eat I mean the world where advanced building material mean cement roofing tile that be make by hand and where when you work 10 hour a day you be still only earn 60 dollar in a month I mean the world where woman and child spend 40 billion hour a year fetch water that be as if the entire workforce of the state of California work full time for a year do nothing but fetch water it be a place where for example if this be India in this room only three of we would have a car if this be Afghanistan only one person in this room would know how the use the internet if this be Zambia 300 of you would be farmer 100 of you would have AIDS or HIV and more than half of you would be live on less than a dollar a day this be the issue that we need to come up with solution for this be the issue that we need to be train we engineer we designer we business person we entrepreneur to be face this be the solution that we need to find I have a few area that I believe be especially important that we address one of they be create technology to promote micro finance and micro enterprise so that person who be live below the poverty line can find a way to move out and that they be not do it use the same traditional basket make poultry rearing etc but there be new technology and new product that they can make on a small scale the next thing I believe be that we need to create technology for poor farmer to add value to they own crop and we need to rethink we development strategy so that we be not promote educational campaign to get they to stop be farmer but rather to stop be poor farmer and we need to think about how we can do that effectively we need to work with the person in this community and give they the resource and the tool that they need to solve they own problem that be the good way to do it we should not be do it from outside so we need to create this future and we need to start do it now thank you applause Chris Anderson thank you incredible stay here tell we just while we see if someone have a question just tell we about one of the other thing that you have work on Amy Smith some of the other thing we be work on be way to do low cost water quality testing so that community can maintain they own water system know when they be work know when they treat they etc we be also look at low cost water treatment system one of the really exciting thing be look at solar water disinfection and improve the ability to be able to do that CA what be the bottleneck prevent this stuff get from scale do you need to find entrepreneur or venture capitalist or what do you need to take what you have get and get it to scale as I think it be large number of person move it forward it be a difficult thing it be a marketplace which be very fragmented and a consumer population with no income so you can not use the same model that you use in the United States for make thing move forward and we be a pretty small staff which be I laughter so you know I do what I can with the student we have 30 student a year go out into the field and try to implement this and move it forward the other thing be you have to do thing with a long time frame as you know you can not expect to get something do in a year or two year you have to be look five or 10 year ahead but I think with the vision to do that we can move forward
