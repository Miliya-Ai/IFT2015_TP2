you might be wonder why I be wear sunglass and one answer to that be because I be here to talk about glamour so we all think we know what glamour be here it be it be glamorous movie star like Marlene Dietrich and it come in a male form too very glamorous not only can he shoot drive drink you know he drink wine there actually be a little wine in there and of course always wear a tuxedo but I think that glamour actually have a much broad mean one that be true for the movie star and the fictional character but also come in other form a magazine well it be certainly not this one this be the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand it be all about sex tip sex tip be not glamorous and Drew Barrymore for all she wonderful charm be not glamorous either but there be a glamour of industry this be Margaret Bourke White one of she picture she do fantastic glamorous picture of steel mill and paper mill and all kind of glamorous industrial place and there be the mythic glamour of the garage entrepreneur this be the Hewlett Packard garage we know everyone who start a business in a garage end up find Hewlett Packard there be the glamour of physics what could be more glamorous than understand the entire universe grand unification and by the way it help if you be Brian Greene he have other kind of glamour and there be of course this glamour this be very very glamorous the glamour of outer space and not the alien style glamour but the nice clean early 60 version so what do we mean by glamour well one thing you can do if you want to know what glamour mean be you can look in the dictionary and it actually help a lot more if you look in a very old dictionary in this case the 1913 dictionary because for century glamour have a very particular meaning and the word be actually use differently from the way we think of it you have a glamour it be not glamour as a quality you cast a glamour glamour be a literal magic spell not a metaphorical one the way we use it today but a literal magic spell associate with witch and gypsy and to some extent Celtic magic and over the year around the turn of the 20th century it start to take on this other kind of deception this definition for any artificial interest in or association with a object through which it appear delusively magnify or glorify but still glamour be a illusion glamour be a magic spell and there be something dangerous about glamour throughout most of history when the witch cast a magic spell on you it be not in you self interest it be to get you to act against you interest well of course in the 20th century glamour come to have this different meaning associate with Hollywood and this be Hedy Lamarr Hedy Lamarr say anyone can look glamorous all you have to do be sit there and look stupid laughter but in fact with all due respect to Hedy about whom we will hear more later there be a lot more to it there be a tremendous amount of technical achievement associate with create this Hollywood glamour there be score of retoucher and lighting expert and make up expert you can go to the museum of Hollywood history in Hollywood and see Max factor special room that he paint different color depend on the complexion of the star he be go to make up so you have get this highly stylized portrait of something that be not entirely of this earth it be a portrait of a star and actually we see glamorized photo of star all the time they call they false color glamour be a form of falsification but falsification to achieve a particular purpose it may be to illuminate the star it may be to sell a film and it involve a great deal of technique it be not glamour be not something you do not wake up in the morning glamorous I do not care who you be even Nicole Kidman do not wake up in the morning glamorous there be a process of idealization glorification and dramatization and it be not just the case for person glamour do not have to be person architectural photography Julius Schulman who have talk about transfiguration take this fabulous famous picture of the Kauffman House architectural photography be extremely glamorous it put you into this special special world this be Alex Ross comic book art which appear to be extremely realistic as part of he style be he give you a kind of realism in he comic art except that light do not work this way in the real world when you stack person in row the one in the background look small than the one in the foreground but not in the world of glamour what glamour be all about I take this from a blurb in the table of contents of New York magazine which be tell we that glamour be back glamour be all about transcend the everyday and I think that that be start to get at what the core that combine all sort of glamour be this be Filippino Lippi 1543 portrait of Saint Apollonia and I do not know who she be either but this be the 16th century equivalent of a supermodel it be a very glamorous portrait why be it glamorous it be glamorous first because she be beautiful but that do not make you glamorous that only make you beautiful she be graceful she be mysterious and she be transcendent and that be the central quality of glamour you do not see she eye they be look downward she be not look away from you exactly but you have to mentally imagine she world she be encourage you to contemplate this high world to which she belong where she can be completely tranquil while hold the iron instrument of she death by torture Mel Gibson passion of the Christ not glamorous that be glamour that be Michelangelo Pieta where Mary be the same age as Jesus and they be both awfully happy and pleasant glamour invite we to live in a different world it have to simultaneously be mysterious a little bit distant that be why often in this glamour shoot the person be not look at the audience it be why sunglass be glamorous but also not so far above we that we can not identify with the person in some sense there have to be something like we so as I say in religious art you know God be not glamorous God can not be glamorous because God be omnipotent omniscient too far above we and yet you will see in religious art saint or the Virgin Mary will often be portray not always in glamorous form as I say early glamour do not have to be about person but it have to have this transcendent quality what be it about Superman aside from Alex Ross style which be very glamorous one thing about Superman be he make you believe that a man can fly glamour be all about transcend this world and get to a idealized perfect place and this be one reason that mode of transportation tend to be extremely glamorous the less experience we have with they the more glamorous they be so you can do a glamorized picture of a car but you can not do a glamorized picture of traffic you can do a glamorized picture of a airplane but not the inside the notion be that it be go to transport you and the story be not about you know the guy in front of you in the airplane who have this nasty little kid or the big cough the story be about where you be arrive or think about where you be arrive and this sense of be transport be one reason that we have glamour style this sort of streamline styling be not just glamorous because we associate it with movie of that period but because in it be streamline it transport we from the everyday the same thing arch be very glamorous Arches with stain glass even more glamorous staircase that curve away from you be glamorous I happen to find that particular staircase picture very glamorous because to I it capture the whole promise of the academic contemplative life but maybe that be because I go to Princeton anyway skyline be super glamorous city street not so glamorous you know when you get actually to this town it have reality the horizon the open road be very very glamorous there be few thing more glamorous than the horizon except possibly multiple horizon of course here you do not feel the cold or the heat you just see the possibility in order to pull glamour off you need this Renaissance quality of sprezzatura which be a term coin by Castiglione in he book the Book of the courtier there be the not glamorous version of what it look like today after a few century and sprezzatura be the art that conceal art it make thing look effortless you do not think about how Nicole Kidman be maneuver that dress she just look completely natural and I remember read after the lara croft movie how Angelina Jolie would go home completely black and blue of course they cover that with make up because lara Croft do all that same stunt but she do not get black and blue because she have sprezzatura to conceal all art and make whatever be do or say appear to be without effort and this be one of the critical aspect of glamour glamour be about edit how do you create the sense of transcendence the sense of evoke a perfect world the sense of you know life could be good I could join this I could be a perfect person I could join this perfect world we do not tell you all the grubby detail now this be kindly lend to I by Jeff Bezos from last year this be underneath Jeff desk this be what the real world of computer lamp electrical appliance of all kind look like but if you look in a catalog particularly a catalog of modern beautiful object for you home it look like this there be no cord look next time you get this catalog in you mail you can usually figure out where they hide the cord but there be always this illusion that if you buy this lamp you will live in a world without cord laughter and the same thing be true of if you buy this laptop or you buy this computer and even in this wireless era you do not get to live in the world without cord you have to have mystery and you have to have grace and there she be Grace this be the most glamorous picture I think ever part of the thing be that in Rear Window the question be be she too glamorous to live in he world and the answer be no but of course it be really just a movie here be Hedy Lamarr again and you know this kind of head cover be extremely glamorous because like sunglass it conceal and reveal at the same time translucence be glamorous that be why all this person wear pearl it be why barware be glamorous glamour be translucent not transparent not opaque it invite we into the world but it do not give we a completely clear picture and I think if Grace Kelly be the most glamorous person maybe a spiral staircase with glass block may be the most glamorous interior shot because a spiral staircase be incredibly glamorous it have that sense of go up and away and yet you never think about how you would really trip if you be particularly go down and of course glass block have that sense of translucence so this session suppose to be about pure pleasure but glamour really partly about mean all individual and all culture have ideal that can not possibly be realize in reality they have contradiction they uphold principle that be incommensurable with each other whatever it be and yet this ideal give meaning and purpose to we life as culture and as individual and the way we deal with that be we displace they we put they into a golden world a imagine world a age of hero the world to come and in the life of a individual we often associate that with some object the white picket fence the perfect house the perfect kitchen no bill on the counter in the perfect kitchen you know you buy that vike range this be what you kitchen will look like the perfect love life symbolize by the perfect necklace the perfect diamond ring the perfect getaway in you perfect car this be a interior design firm that be literally call Utopia the perfect office again no cord as far as I can tell and certainly no it do not look a thing like my office I mean there be no paper on the desk we want this golden world and some person get rich enough and if they have they ideal in a sort of domestic sense they get to acquire they perfect world Dean Koontz build this fabulous home theater which be I do not think accidentally in Art Deco style that symbolize this sense of be safe and at home this be not always good because what be you perfect world what be you ideal and also what have be edit out be it something important the Matrix be a movie that be all about glamour I could do a whole talk on the matrix and glamour it be criticize for glamorize violence because look sunglass and that long coat and of course they could walk up wall and do all this kind of thing that be impossible in the real world this be another Margaret Bourke White photo this be from Soviet Union attractive I mean look how happy the person be and good look too you know we be march toward Utopia I be not a fan of PETA but I think this be a great ad because what they be do be they be say you coat be not so glamorous what be be edit out be something important but actually what be even more important than remember what be be edit out be think be the ideal good because glamour can be very totalitarian and deceptive and it be not just a matter of glamorize clean you floor this be from Triumph of the Will brilliant editing to cut together thing there be a glamour shoot national socialism be all about glamour it be a very aesthetic ideology it be all about clean up Germany and the West and the world and rid it of anything unglamorous so glamour can be dangerous I think glamour have a genuine appeal have a genuine value I be not against glamour but there be a kind of wonder in the stuff that get edit away in the cord of life and there be both a way to avoid the danger of glamour and a way to broaden you appreciation of it and that be to take Isaac Mizrahi advice and confront the manipulation of it all and sort of admit that manipulation be something that we enjoy but also enjoy how it happen and here be Hedy Lamarr she be very glamorous but you know she invent spread spectrum technology so she be even more glamorous if you know that she really be not stupid even though she think she could look stupid David Hockney talk about how the appreciation of this very glamorous painting be heighten if you think about the fact that it take two week to paint this splash which only take a fraction of a second to happen there be a book out in the bookstore it be call Symphony in Steel and it be about the stuff that be hide under the skin of the Disney Center and that have a fascination it be not necessarily glamorous but unveil the glamour have a appeal there be a wonderful book call crown that be all this glamour picture of black woman in they church hat and there be a quote from one of this woman and she talk about as a little girl I would admire woman at church with beautiful hat they look like beautiful doll like they would just step out of a magazine but I also know how hard they work all week sometimes under that hat there be a lot of joy and a lot of sorrow and actually you get more appreciation for glamour when you realize what go into create it thank you
