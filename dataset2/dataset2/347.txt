this rock have be hit we earth for about three billion year and be responsible for much of what go on on we planet this be a example of a real meteorite and you can see all the melting of the iron from the speed and the heat when a meteorite hit the earth and just how much of it survive and melt from a meteorite from space we be over here with a original Sputnik this be one of the seven survive Sputniks that be not launch into space this be not a copy the space age begin 50 year ago in October and that exactly what Sputnik look like and it would not be fun to talk about the space age without see a flag that be carry to the moon and back on Apollo 11 the astronaut each get to carry about ten silk flag in they personal kit they would bring they back and mount they so this have actually be carry to the moon and back so that for fun the dawn of book be of course important and it would not be interesting to talk about the dawn of book without have a copy of a Guttenberg Bible you can see how portable and handy it be to have you own Guttenberg in 1455 but what interesting about the Guttenberg Bible and the dawn of this technology be not the book you see the book be not drive by read in 1455 nobody could read so why do the printing press succeed this be a original page of a Guttenberg Bible so you be look here at one of the first print book use movable type in the history of man 550 year ago we be live at the age here at the end of the book where electronic paper will undoubtedly replace it but why be this so interesting here the quick story it turn out that in the 1450 the Catholic Church need money and so they actually hand write this thing call indulgence which be forgiveness on piece of paper they travel all around Europe and sell by the hundred or by the thousand they get you out of purgatory fast and when the printing press be invent what they find be they could print indulgence which be the equivalent of print money and so all of Western Europe start buy print press in 1455 to print out thousand and then hundred of thousand and then ultimately million of single small piece of paper that get you out of middle hell and into heaven that be why the printing press succeed and that be why Martin Luther nail he 90 thesis to the door because he be complain that the Catholic Church have go amok in print out indulgence and sell they in every town and village and city in all of Western Europe so the printing press lady and gentleman be drive entirely by the printing of forgiveness and have nothing to do with read more tomorrow I also have picture come of the library for that of you that have ask for picture we be go to have some tomorrow applause instead of show a object from the stage I be go to do something special for the first time we be go to show actually what the library look like ok so I be marry to the most wonderful woman in the world you be go to find out why in a minute because when I go to see Eileen this be what I say I want to build this be the Library of Human Imagination the room itself be three story tall in the glass panel be 5 000 year of human imagination that be computer control the room be a theatre it change color and all throughout the library be different object different space it design like a Escher print here be some of the low level of the library where the exhibit constantly change you can walk through you can touch you can see exactly how many of this type of item would fit in a room there my very own Saturn V everybody should have one ok laughter so you can see here in the low level of the library the book and the object in the glass panel all along be sort of the history of imagination there be a glass bridge that you walk across that suspend in space so it a leap of imagination how do we create part of the question that I have answer be be we create by surround ourselves with stimulus with human achievement with history with the thing that drive we and make we human the passionate discovery the bone of dinosaur long go the map of space that we have experience and ultimately the hallway that stimulate we mind and we imagination so hopefully tomorrow I will show one or two more object from the stage but for today I just want to say thank you for all the person that come and talk to we about it and Eileen and I be thrilled to open we home and share it with the TED community applause TED be all about pattern in the cloud it all about connection it all about see thing that everybody else have see before but think about they in way that nobody have think of they before and that really what discovery and imagination be all about for example we can look at a dna molecule model here none of we really have ever see one but we know it exist because we have be teach to understand this molecule but we can also look at a Enigma machine from the Nazi in World War II that be a coding and decoding machine now you might say what do this have to do with this well this be the code for life and this be a code for death this two molecule code and decode and yet look at they you would see a machine and a molecule but once you have see they in a new way you realize that both of this thing really be connect and they be connect primarily because of this here you see this be a human brain model ok and it rare because we never really get to see a brain we get to see a skull but there it be all of imagination everything that we think we feel we sense come through the human brain and once we create new pattern in this brain once we shape the brain in a new way it never return to its original shape and I will give you a quick example we think about the internet we think about information that go across the internet and we never think about the hidden connection but I bring along here a lump of coal right here one lump of coal and what do a lump of coal have to do with the internet you see it take the energy in one lump of coal to move one megabyte of information across the net so every time you download a file each megabyte be a lump of coal what that mean be a 200 megabyte file look like this lady and gentleman ok so the next time you download a gigabyte or two gigabyte it not for free ok the connection be the energy it take to run the web and to make everything we think possible possible thanks Chris applause
