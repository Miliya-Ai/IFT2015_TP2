suppose that two American friend be travel together in Italy they go to see Michelangelo David and when they finally come face to face with the statue they both freeze dead in they track the first guy we will call he Adam be transfix by the beauty of the perfect human form the second guy we will call he Bill be transfix by embarrassment at stare at the thing there in the center so here be my question for you which one of this two guy be more likely to have vote for George Bush which for Al Gore I do not need a show of hand because we all have the same political stereotype we all know that it be Bill and in this case the stereotype correspond to reality it really be a fact that liberal be much high than conservative on a major personality trait call openness to experience person who be high in openness to experience just crave novelty variety diversity new idea travel person low on it like thing that be familiar that be safe and dependable if you know about this trait you can understand a lot of puzzle about human behavior you can understand why artist be so different from accountant you can actually predict what kind of book they like to read what kind of place they like to travel to and what kind of food they like to eat once you understand this trait you can understand why anybody would eat at Applebee but not anybody that you know laughter this trait also tell we a lot about politics the main researcher of this trait Robert McCrae say that Open individual have a affinity for liberal progressive left wing political view they like a society which be open and change whereas close individual prefer conservative traditional right wing view this trait also tell we a lot about the kind of group person join so here be the description of a group I find on the web what kind of person would join a global community welcome person from every discipline and culture who seek a deep understanding of the world and who hope to turn that understanding into a good future for we all this be from some guy name Ted laughter well let see now if openness predict who become liberal and openness predict who become a tedster then might we predict that most tedster be liberal let find out I be go to ask you to raise you hand whether you be liberal left of center on social issue we be talk about primarily or conservative and I will give a third option because I know there be a number of Libertarian in the audience so right now please raise you hand down in the simulcast room too let let everybody see who be here please raise you hand if you would say that you be liberal or left of center please raise you hand high right now ok please raise you hand if you would say you be Libertarian ok about a two dozen and please raise you hand if you would say you be right of center or conservative one two three four five about eight or 10 ok this be a bit of a problem because if we goal be to understand the world to seek a deep understanding of the world we general lack of moral diversity here be go to make it hard because when person all share value when person all share moral they become a team and once you engage the psychology of team it shut down open minded thinking when the liberal team lose as it do in 2004 and as it almost do in 2000 we comfort ourselves laughter we try to explain why half of America vote for the other team we think they must be blind by religion or by simple stupidity laughter applause so if you think that half of America vote Republican because they be blind in this way then my message to you be that you be trap in a moral matrix in a particular moral matrix and by the matrix I mean literally the matrix like the movie the Matrix but I be here today to give you a choice you can either take the blue pill and stick to you comforting delusion or you can take the red pill learn some moral psychology and step outside the moral matrix now because I know applause ok I assume that answer my question I be go to ask you which one you pick but no need you be all high in openness to experience and besides it look like it might even taste good and you be all epicure so anyway let go with the red pill let study some moral psychology and see where it take we let start at the beginning what be morality and where do it come from the bad idea in all of psychology be the idea that the mind be a blank slate at birth developmental psychology have show that kid come into the world already know so much about the physical and social world and program to make it really easy for they to learn certain thing and hard to learn other the good definition of innateness I have ever see this just clarify so many thing for I be from the brain scientist Gary Marcus He say the initial organization of the brain do not depend that much on experience nature provide a first draft which experience then revise build in do not mean unmalleable it mean organize in advance of experience ok so what be on the first draft of the moral mind to find out my colleague Craig Joseph and I read through the literature on anthropology on culture variation in morality and also on evolutionary psychology look for match what be the sort of thing that person talk about across discipline that you find across culture and even across species we find five five good match which we call the five foundation of morality the first one be harm care we be all mammal here we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programming that make we really bond with other care for other feel compassion for other especially the weak and vulnerable it give we very strong feeling about that who cause harm this moral foundation underlie about 70 percent of the moral statement I have hear here at TED the second foundation be fairness reciprocity there be actually ambiguous evidence as to whether you find reciprocity in other animal but the evidence for person could not be clear this Norman Rockwell painting be call the Golden Rule and we hear about this from Karen Armstrong of course as the foundation of so many religion that second foundation underlie the other 30 percent of the moral statement I have hear here at TED the third foundation be in group loyalty you do find group in the animal kingdom you do find cooperative group but this group be always either very small or they be all sibling it be only among human that you find very large group of person who be able to cooperate join together into group but in this case group that be unite to fight other group this probably come from we long history of tribal living of tribal psychology and this tribal psychology be so deeply pleasurable that even when we do not have tribe we go ahead and make they because it be fun laughter Sports be to war as pornography be to sex we get to exercise some ancient ancient drive the fourth foundation be authority respect here you see submissive gesture from two member of very closely related species but authority in human be not so closely base on power and brutality as it be in other primate it be base on more voluntary deference and even element of love at time the fifth foundation be purity sanctity this painting be call the allegory of chastity but purity be not just about suppress female sexuality it be about any kind of ideology any kind of idea that tell you that you can attain virtue by control what you do with you body by control what you put into you body and while the political right may moralize sex much more the political left be really do a lot of it with food food be become extremely moralize nowadays and a lot of it be idea about purity about what you be willing to touch or put into you body I believe this be the five good candidate for what be write on the first draft of the moral mind I think this be what we come with at least a preparedness to learn all of this thing but as my son Max grow up in a liberal college town how be this first draft go to get revise and how will it end up be different from a kid bear 60 mile south of we in Lynchburg Virginia to think about culture variation let try a different metaphor if there really be five system at work in the mind five source of intuition and emotion then we can think of the moral mind as be like one of that audio equalizer that have five channel where you can set it to a different setting on every channel and my colleague Brian Nosek and Jesse Graham and I make a questionnaire which we put up on the web at www YourMorals org and so far 30 000 person have take this questionnaire and you can too here be the result here be the result from about 23 000 American citizen on the leave I have plot the score for liberal on the right that for conservative in the middle the moderate the blue line show you person response on the average of all the harm question so as you see person care about harm and care issue they give high endorsement of this sort of statement all across the board but as you also see liberal care about it a little more than conservative the line slope down same story for fairness but look at the other three line for liberal the score be very low liberal be basically say no this be not morality in group authority purity this stuff have nothing to do with morality I reject it but as person get more conservative the value rise we can say that liberal have a kind of a two channel or two foundation morality conservative have more of a five foundation or five channel morality we find this in every country we look at here be the datum for 1 100 Canadian I will just flip through a few other slide the U K Australia New Zealand Western Europe Eastern Europe Latin America the Middle East East Asia and South Asia Notice also that on all of this graph the slope be steep on in group authority purity which show that within any country the disagreement be not over harm and fairness everybody I mean we debate over what be fair but everybody agree that harm and fairness matter Moral argument within culture be especially about issue of in group authority purity this effect be so robust that we find it no matter how we ask the question in one recent study we ask person to suppose you be about to get a dog you pick a particular breed you learn some new information about the breed suppose you learn that this particular breed be independent minded and relate to its owner as a friend and a equal well if you be a liberal you say hey that be great because liberal like to say fetch please laughter but if you be conservative that be not so attractive if you be conservative and you learn that a dog extremely loyal to its home and family and do not warm up quickly to stranger for conservative well loyalty be good dog ought to be loyal but to a liberal it sound like this dog be run for the Republican nomination laughter so you might say ok there be this difference between liberal and conservative but what make that three other foundation moral be not that just the foundation of xenophobia and authoritarianism and Puritanism what make they moral the answer I think be contain in this incredible triptych from Hieronymus Bosch The Garden of Earthly Delights in the first panel we see the moment of creation all be order all be beautiful all the person and animal be do what they be suppose to be do where they be suppose to be but then give the way of the world thing change we get every person do whatever he want with every aperture of every other person and every other animal some of you might recognize this as the 60 laughter but the 60 inevitably give way to the 70 where the cutting of the aperture hurt a little bit more of course Bosch call this hell so this triptych this three panel portray the timeless truth that order tend to decay the truth of social entropy but lest you think this be just some part of the Christian imagination where Christian have this weird problem with pleasure here be the same story the same progression tell in a paper that be publish in Nature a few year ago in which Ernst Fehr and Simon Gachter have person play a common dilemma a game in which you give person money and then on each round of the game they can put money into a common pot and then the experimenter double what be in there and then it be all divide among the player so it be a really nice analog for all sort of environmental issue where we be ask person to make a sacrifice and they themselves do not really benefit from they own sacrifice but you really want everybody else to sacrifice but everybody have a temptation to a free ride and what happen be that at first person start off reasonably cooperative and this be all play anonymously on the first round person give about half of the money that they can but they quickly see you know what other person be not do so much though I do not want to be a sucker I be not go to cooperate and so cooperation quickly decay from reasonably good down to close to zero but then and here be the trick Fehr and Gachter say on the seventh round they tell person you know what New rule if you want to give some of you own money to punish person who be not contribute you can do that and as soon as person hear about the punishment issue go on cooperation shoot up it shoot up and it keep go up there be a lot of research show that to solve cooperative problem it really help it be not enough to just appeal to person good motive it really help to have some sort of punishment even if it be just shame or embarrassment or gossip you need some sort of punishment to bring person when they be in large group to cooperate there be even some recent research suggest that religion priming God make person think about God often in some situation lead to more cooperative more pro social behavior some person think that religion be a adaptation evolve both by cultural and biological evolution to make group to cohere in part for the purpose of trust each other and then be more effective at compete with other group I think that be probably right although this be a controversial issue but I be particularly interested in religion and the origin of religion and in what it do to we and for we because I think that the great wonder in the world be not the Grand Canyon the Grand Canyon be really simple it be just a lot of rock and then a lot of water and wind and a lot of time and you get the Grand Canyon it be not that complicated this be what be really complicated that there be person live in place like the Grand Canyon cooperate with each other or on the savannah of Africa or on the frozen shore of Alaska and then some of this village grow into the mighty city of Babylon and Rome and Tenochtitlan how do this happen this be a absolute miracle much hard to explain than the Grand Canyon the answer I think be that they use every tool in the toolbox it take all of we moral psychology to create this cooperative group yes you do need to be concern about harm you do need a psychology of justice but it really help to organize a group if you can have sub group and if that sub group have some internal structure and if you have some ideology that tell person to suppress they carnality to pursue high noble end and now we get to the crux of the disagreement between liberal and conservative because liberal reject three of this foundation they say no let celebrate diversity not common in group membership they say let question authority and they say keep you law off my body liberal have very noble motive for do this traditional authority traditional morality can be quite repressive and restrictive to that at the bottom to woman to person that do not fit in so liberal speak for the weak and oppressed they want change and justice even at the risk of chaos this guy shirt say stop bitching start a revolution if you be high in openness to experience revolution be good it be change it be fun conservative on the other hand speak for institution and tradition they want order even at some cost to that at the bottom the great conservative insight be that order be really hard to achieve it be really precious and it be really easy to lose so as Edmund Burke say the restraint on man as well as they liberty be to be reckon among they right this be after the chaos of the French Revolution so once you see this once you see that liberal and conservative both have something to contribute that they form a balance on change versus stability then I think the way be open to step outside the moral matrix this be the great insight that all the Asian religion have attain think about yin and yang Yin and yang be not enemy Yin and yang do not hate each other Yin and yang be both necessary like night and day for the functioning of the world you find the same thing in Hinduism there be many high god in Hinduism two of they be Vishnu the preserver and shiva the destroyer this image actually be both of that god share the same body you have the marking of Vishnu on the leave so we could think of Vishnu as the conservative god you have the marking of shiva on the right shiva the liberal god and they work together you find the same thing in Buddhism this two stanza contain I think the deep insight that have ever be attain into moral psychology from the Zen master Seng ts an if you want the truth to stand clear before you never be for or against the struggle between for and against be the mind bad disease now unfortunately it be a disease that have be catch by many of the world leader but before you feel superior to George Bush before you throw a stone ask yourself do you accept this do you accept step out of the battle of good and evil can you be not for or against anything so what be the point what should you do well if you take the great insight from ancient Asian philosophy and religion and you combine they with the late research on moral psychology I think you come to this conclusion that we righteous mind be design by evolution to unite we into team to divide we against other team and then to blind we to the truth so what should you do be I tell you to not strive be I tell you to embrace Seng ts an and stop stop with this struggle of for and against no absolutely not I be not say that this be a amazing group of person who be do so much use so much of they talent they brilliance they energy they money to make the world a good place to fight to fight wrong to solve problem but as we learn from Samantha Power in she story about Sergio Vieira de Mello you can not just go charge in say you be wrong and I be right because as we just hear everybody think they be right a lot of the problem we have to solve be problem that require we to change other person and if you want to change other person a much good way to do it be to first understand who we be understand we moral psychology understand that we all think we be right and then step out even if it be just for a moment step out check in with Seng ts an step out of the moral matrix just try to see it as a struggle play out in which everybody do think they be right and everybody at least have some reason even if you disagree with they everybody have some reason for what they be do step out and if you do that that be the essential move to cultivate moral humility to get yourself out of this self righteousness which be the normal human condition think about the Dalai Lama think about the enormous moral authority of the Dalai Lama and it come from he moral humility so I think the point the point of my talk and I think the point of TED be that this be a group that be passionately engage in the pursuit of change the world for the good person here be passionately engage in try to make the world a good place but there be also a passionate commitment to the truth and so I think that the answer be to use that passionate commitment to the truth to try to turn it into a good future for we all thank you applause
