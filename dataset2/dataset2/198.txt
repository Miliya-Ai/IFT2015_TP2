I grow up to study the brain because I have a brother who have be diagnose with a brain disorder schizophrenia and as a sister and later as a scientist I want to understand why be it that I can take my dream I can connect they to my reality and I can make my dream come true what be it about my brother brain and he schizophrenia that he can not connect he dream to a common and share reality so they instead become delusion so I dedicate my career to research into the severe mental illness and I move from my home state of Indiana to Boston where I be work in the lab of Dr Francine Benes in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry and in the lab we be ask the question what be the biological difference between the brain of individual who would be diagnose as normal control as compare with the brain of individual diagnose with schizophrenia schizoaffective or bipolar disorder so we be essentially map the microcircuitry of the brain which cell be communicate with which cell with which chemical and then in what quantity of that chemical so there be a lot of mean in my life because I be perform this type of research during the day but then in the evening and on the weekend I travel as a advocate for NAMI the National Alliance on Mental Illness but on the morning of December 10 1996 I wake up to discover that I have a brain disorder of my own a blood vessel explode in the left half of my brain and in the course of four hour I watch my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information on the morning of the hemorrhage I could not walk talk read write or recall any of my life I essentially become a infant in a woman body if you have ever see a human brain it be obvious that the two hemisphere be completely separate from one another and I have bring for you a real human brain groan laughter so this be a real human brain this be the front of the brain the back of brain with the spinal cord hang down and this be how it would be position inside of my head and when you look at the brain it be obvious that the two cerebral cortex be completely separate from one another for that of you who understand computer we right hemisphere function like a parallel processor while we leave hemisphere function like a serial processor the two hemisphere do communicate with one another through the corpus callosum which be make up of some 300 million axonal fiber but other than that the two hemisphere be completely separate because they process information differently each of we hemisphere think about different thing they care about different thing and dare I say they have very different personality excuse I thank you it be be a joy Assistant it have be laughter we right human hemisphere be all about this present moment it be all about right here right now we right hemisphere it think in picture and it learn kinesthetically through the movement of we body information in the form of energy stream in simultaneously through all of we sensory system and then it explode into this enormous collage of what this present moment look like what this present moment smell like and taste like what it feel like and what it sound like I be a energy be connect to the energy all around I through the consciousness of my right hemisphere we be energy be connect to one another through the consciousness of we right hemisphere as one human family and right here right now we be brother and sister on this planet here to make the world a good place and in this moment we be perfect we be whole and we be beautiful my left hemisphere we leave hemisphere be a very different place we leave hemisphere think linearly and methodically we leave hemisphere be all about the past and it be all about the future we leave hemisphere be design to take that enormous collage of the present moment and start pick out detail and more detail about that detail it then categorize and organize all that information associate it with everything in the past we have ever learn and project into the future all of we possibility and we leave hemisphere think in language it be that ongoing brain chatter that connect I and my internal world to my external world it be that little voice that say to I hey you have get to remember to pick up banana on you way home I need they in the morning it be that calculate intelligence that remind I when I have to do my laundry but perhaps most important it be that little voice that say to I I be I be and as soon as my left hemisphere say to I I be I become separate I become a single solid individual separate from the energy flow around I and separate from you and this be the portion of my brain that I lose on the morning of my stroke on the morning of the stroke I wake up to a pound pain behind my left eye and it be the kind of caustic pain that you get when you bite into ice cream and it just grip I and then it release I and then it just grip I and then it release I and it be very unusual for I to ever experience any kind of pain so I think ok I will just start my normal routine so I get up and I jump onto my cardio glider which be a full body full exercise machine and I be jam away on this thing and I be realize that my hand look like primitive claw grasp onto the bar and I think that be very peculiar and I look down at my body and I think whoa I be a weird look thing and it be as though my consciousness have shift away from my normal perception of reality where I be the person on the machine have the experience to some esoteric space where I be witness myself have this experience and it be all very peculiar and my headache be just get bad so I get off the machine and I be walk across my living room floor and I realize that everything inside of my body have slow way down and every step be very rigid and very deliberate there be no fluidity to my pace and there be this constriction in my area of perception so I be just focus on internal system and I be stand in my bathroom get ready to step into the shower and I could actually hear the dialogue inside of my body I hear a little voice say ok you muscle you have get to contract you muscle you relax and then I lose my balance and I be prop up against the wall and I look down at my arm and I realize that I can no longer define the boundary of my body I can not define where I begin and where I end because the atom and the molecule of my arm blend with the atom and molecule of the wall and all I could detect be this energy energy and I be ask myself what be wrong with I what be go on and in that moment my left hemisphere brain chatter go totally silent just like someone take a remote control and push the mute button total silence and at first I be shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind but then I be immediately captivate by the magnificence of the energy around I and because I could no longer identify the boundary of my body I feel enormous and expansive I feel at one with all the energy that be and it be beautiful there then all of a sudden my left hemisphere come back online and it say to I hey we have get a problem we have get to get some help and I be go Ahh I have get a problem laughter so it be like ok I have get a problem but then I immediately drift right back out into the consciousness and I affectionately refer to this space as La La Land but it be beautiful there imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnect from you brain chatter that connect you to the external world so here I be in this space and my job and any stress relate to my job it be go and I feel light in my body and imagine all of the relationship in the external world and any stressor relate to any of that they be go and I feel this sense of peacefulness and imagine what it would feel like to lose 37 year of emotional baggage laughter oh I feel euphoria euphoria it be beautiful and again my left hemisphere come online and it say hey you have get to pay attention we have get to get help and I be think I have get to get help I have get to focus so I get out of the shower and I mechanically dress and I be walk around my apartment and I be think I have get to get to work can I drive and in that moment my right arm go totally paralyze by my side then I realize oh my gosh I be have a stroke and the next thing my brain say to I be wow this be so cool laughter this be so cool how many brain scientist have the opportunity to study they own brain from the inside out laughter and then it cross my mind but I be a very busy woman laughter I do not have time for a stroke so I be like ok I can not stop the stroke from happen so I will do this for a week or two and then I will get back to my routine ok so I have get to call help I have get to call work I could not remember the number at work so I remember in my office I have a business card with my number so I go into my business room I pull out a three inch stack of business card and I be look at the card on top and even though I could see clearly in my mind eye what my business card look like I could not tell if this be my card or not because all I could see be pixel and the pixel of the word blend with the pixel of the background and the pixel of the symbol and I just could not tell and then I would wait for what I call a wave of clarity and in that moment I would be able to reattach to normal reality and I could tell that be not the card that be not the card it take I 45 minute to get one inch down inside of that stack of card in the meantime for 45 minute the hemorrhage be get big in my left hemisphere I do not understand number I do not understand the telephone but it be the only plan I have so I take the phone pad and I put it right here I take the business card I put it right here and I be match the shape of the squiggle on the card to the shape of the squiggle on the phone pad but then I would drift back out into La La Land and not remember when I come back if I have already dial that number so I have to wield my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the number as I go along and push they so that as I would come back to normal reality I would be able to tell yes I have already dial that number eventually the whole number get dial and I be listen to the phone and my colleague pick up the phone and he say to I woo woo woo woo laughter laughter and I think to myself oh my gosh he sound like a Golden Retriever laughter and so I say to he clear in my mind I say to he this be Jill I need help and what come out of my voice be Woo woo woo woo woo I be think oh my gosh I sound like a Golden Retriever so I could not know I do not know that I could not speak or understand language until I try so he recognize that I need help and he get I help and a little while later I be ride in a ambulance from one hospital across Boston to Massachusetts General Hospital and I curl up into a little fetal ball and just like a balloon with the last bit of air just right out of the balloon I just feel my energy lift and just I feel my spirit surrender and in that moment I know that I be no long the choreographer of my life and either the doctor rescue my body and give I a second chance at life or this be perhaps my moment of transition when I wake later that afternoon I be shock to discover that I be still alive when I feel my spirit surrender I say goodbye to my life and my mind be now suspend between two very opposite plane of reality stimulation come in through my sensory system feel like pure pain light burn my brain like wildfire and sound be so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out from the background noise and I just want to escape because I could not identify the position of my body in space I feel enormous and expansive like a genie just liberate from she bottle and my spirit soar free like a great whale glide through the sea of silent euphoria Nirvana I find Nirvana and I remember think there be no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body but then I realize but I be still alive I be still alive and I have find Nirvana and if I have find Nirvana and I be still alive then everyone who be alive can find Nirvana and I picture a world fill with beautiful peaceful compassionate loving person who know that they could come to this space at any time and that they could purposely choose to step to the right of they leave hemisphere and find this peace and then I realize what a tremendous gift this experience could be what a stroke of insight this could be to how we live we life and it motivate I to recover two and a half week after the hemorrhage the surgeon go in and they remove a blood clot the size of a golf ball that be push on my language center here I be with my mama who be a true angel in my life it take I eight year to completely recover so who be we we be the life force power of the universe with manual dexterity and two cognitive mind and we have the power to choose moment by moment who and how we want to be in the world right here right now I can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere where we be I be the life force power of the universe I be the life force power of the 50 trillion beautiful molecular genius that make up my form at one with all that be or I can choose to step into the consciousness of my left hemisphere where I become a single individual a solid separate from the flow separate from you I be Dr Jill Bolte Taylor intellectual neuroanatomist this be the we inside of I which would you choose which do you choose and when I believe that the more time we spend choose to run the deep inner peace circuitry of we right hemisphere the more peace we will project into the world and the more peaceful we planet will be and I think that be a idea worth spread thank you applause
