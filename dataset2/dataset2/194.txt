Roy Gould Less than a year from now the world be go to celebrate the International Year of Astronomy which mark the 400th anniversary of Galileo first glimpse of the night sky through a telescope in a few month the world be also go to celebrate the launch of a new invention from Microsoft Research which I think be go to have as profound a impact on the way we view the universe as Galileo do four century ago it be call the WorldWide Telescope and I want to thank TED and Microsoft for allow I to bring it to you attention and I want to urge you when you get a chance to give it a close look at the TED Lab downstairs the WorldWide Telescope take the good image from the world great telescope on Earth and in space and have weave they seamlessly to produce a holistic view of the universe it be go to change the way we do astronomy it be go to change the way we teach astronomy and I think most importantly it be go to change the way we see ourselves in the universe if we be have this TED meeting in we grandparent day that might not be so big a claim in 1920 for example you be not allow to drink if you be a woman you be not allow to vote and if you look up at the star and the Milky Way on a summer night what you see be think to be the entire universe in fact the head of Harvard observatory back then give a great debate in which he argue that the Milky Way Galaxy be the entire universe Harvard be wrong big time laughter of course we know today that galaxy extend far beyond we own galaxy we can see all the way out to the edge of the observable universe all the way back in time almost to the moment of the Big Bang itself we can see across the entire spectrum of light reveal world that have previously be invisible we see this magnificent star nursery where nature have somehow arrange for just the right number and just the right size of star to be bear for life to arise we see alien world we see alien solar system 300 now and still count and they be not like we we see black hole at the heart of we galaxy in the Milky Way and elsewhere in the universe where time itself seem to stand still but until now we view of the universe have be disconnected and fragmented and I think that many of the marvelous story that nature have to tell we have fall through the crack and that be change I want to just briefly mention three reason why my colleague and I in astronomy and in education be so excited about the WorldWide Telescope and why we think it be truly transformative first it enable you to experience the universe the WorldWide Telescope for I be a kind of magic carpet that let you navigate through the universe where you want to go second you can tour the universe with astronomer as you guide and I be not talk here about just expert who be tell you what you be see but really person who be passionate about the various nook and cranny of the universe who can share they enthusiasm and can make the universe a welcoming place and third you can create you own tour you can share they with friend you can create they with friend and that be the part that I think I be most excited about because I think that at heart we be all storyteller and in tell story each of we be go to understand the universe in we own way we be go to have a personal universe I think we be go to see a community of storyteller evolve and emerge before I introduce the person responsible for the WorldWide Telescope I just want to leave you with this brief thought when I ask person how do the night sky make you feel they often say oh tiny I feel tiny and insignificant well we gaze fill the universe and thanks to the creator of the WorldWide Telescope we can now start to have a dialogue with the universe I think the WorldWide Telescope will convince you that we may be tiny but we be truly wonderfully significant thank you applause I can not tell you what a privilege it be to introduce Curtis Wong from Microsoft applause Curtis Wong thank you Roy so what you be see here be a wonderful presentation but it be one of the tour and actually this tour be one that be create early and the tour be all totally interactive so that if I be to go somewhere you may be watch a tour and you can pause anywhere along the way pull up other information there be lot of web and information source about place you might want to go you can zoom in you can pull back out the whole resource be there available for you so Microsoft this be a project that WorldWide Telescope be dedicate to Jim Gray who be we colleague and a lot of he work that he do be really what make this project possible it be a labor of love for we and we small team and we really hope it will inspire kid to explore and learn about the universe so basically kid of all age like we and so WorldWide Telescope will be available this spring it will be a free download thank you Craig Mundie and it will be available at the website WorldWideTelescope org which be something new and so what you have see today be less than a fraction of one percent of what be in here and in the TED Lab we have a tour that be create by a six year old name Benjamin that will knock you sock off laughter so we will see you there thank you applause
