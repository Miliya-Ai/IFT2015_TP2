I want to start out by ask you to think back to when you be a kid play with block as you figure out how to reach out and grasp pick they up and move they around you be actually learn how to think and solve problem by understand and manipulate spatial relationship spatial reasoning be deeply connect to how we understand a lot of the world around we so as a computer scientist inspire by this utility of we interaction with physical object along with my adviser Pattie and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi I start to wonder what if when we use a computer instead of have this one mouse cursor that be a like a digital fingertip move around a flat desktop what if we could reach in with both hand and grasp information physically arrange it the way we want this question be so compelling that we decide to explore the answer by build siftable in a nutshell a Siftable be a interactive computer the size of a cookie they be able to be move around by hand they can sense each other they can sense they motion and they have a screen and a wireless radio most importantly they be physical so like the block you can move they just by reach out and grasp and siftable be a example of a new ecosystem of tool for manipulate digital information and as this tool become more physical more aware of they motion aware of each other and aware of the nuance of how we move they we can start to explore some new and fun interaction style so I be go to start with some simple example this Siftable be configure to show video and if I tilt it in one direction it will roll the video this way if I tilt it the other way it roll it backwards and this interactive portrait be aware of each other so if I put they next to each other they get interested if they get surround they notice that too they might get a little flustered and they can also sense they motion and tilt one of the interesting implication on interaction we start to realize be that we could use everyday gesture on datum like pour a color the way we might pour a liquid so in this case we have get three Siftables configure to be paint bucket and I can use they to pour color into that central one where they get mixed if we overshoot we can pour a little bit back there be also some neat possibility for education like language math and logic game where we want to give person the ability to try thing quickly and view the result immediately so here I be applause this be a fibonacci sequence that I be make with a simple equation program here we have a word game that be kind of like a mash up between Scrabble and Boggle basically in every round you get a randomly assign letter on each Siftable and as you try to make word it check against a dictionary then after about 30 second it reshuffle and you have a new set of letter and new possibility to try applause thank you applause so this be some kid that come on a field trip to the media lab and I manage to get they to try it out and shoot a video they really love it and one of the interesting thing about this kind of application be that you do not have to give person many instruction all you have to say be make word and they know exactly what to do so here be another few person try it out that be we young beta tester down there on the right turn out all he want to do be to stack the Siftables up so to he they be just block now this be a interactive cartoon application and we want to build a learning tool for language learner and this be Felix actually and he can bring new character into the scene just by lift the Siftables off the table that have that character show on they here he be bring the sun out video the sun be rise David Merrill now he be bring a tractor into the scene video the orange tractor good job yeah dm so by shake the Siftables and put they next to each other he can make the character interact Video Woof DM invent he own narrative video hello dm it be a open ended story and he get to decide how it unfold Video fly away cat dm so the last example I have time to show you today be a music sequencing and live performance tool that we have build recently in which Siftables act as sound like lead bass and drum each of this have four different variation you get to choose which one you want to use and you can inject this sound into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want and you inject it by just bump up the sound siftable against a sequence Siftable there be effect that you can control live like reverb and filter you attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it and then overall effect like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence so let have a look video music dm we will start by put a lead into two sequence siftable arrange they into a series extend it add a little more lead now I put a bass line in Video Music DM now I will put some percussion in Video Music DM and now I will attach the filter to the drum so I can control the effect live Video Music DM I can speed up the whole sequence by tilt the tempo one way or the other Video Music DM and now I will attach the filter to the bass for some more expression Video Music DM I can rearrange the sequence while it play so I do not have to plan it out in advance but I can improvise make it long or short as I go and now finally I can fade the whole sequence out use the volume siftable tilt to the left applause thank you so as you can see my passion be for make new human computer interface that be a good match to the way we brain and body work and today I have time to show you one point in this new design space and a few of the possibility that we be work to bring out of the laboratory so the thought I want to leave you with be that we be on the cusp of this new generation of tool for interact with digital media that be go to bring information into we world on we term thank you very much I look forward to talk with all of you applause
