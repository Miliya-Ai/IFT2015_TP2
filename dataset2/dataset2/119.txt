so I really consider myself a storyteller but I do not really tell story in the usual way in the sense that I do not usually tell my own story instead I be really interested in building tool that allow large number of other person to tell they story person all around the world I do this because I think that person actually have a lot in common I think person be very similar but I also think that we have trouble see that you know as I look around the world I see a lot of gap and I think we all see a lot of gap and we define ourselves by we gap there be language gap there be ethnicity and racial gap there be age gap there be gender gap there be sexuality gap there be wealth and money gap there be education gap there be also religious gap you know we have all this gap and I think we like we gap because they make we feel like we identify with something some small community but I think that actually despite we gap we really have a lot in common and I think one thing we have in common be a very deep need to express ourselves I think this be a very old human desire it be nothing new but the thing about self expression be that there be traditionally be this imbalance between the desire that we have to express ourselves and the number of sympathetic friend who be willing to stand around and listen laughter this also be nothing new since the dawn of human history we have try to rectify this imbalance by make art writing poem sing song scripting editorial and send they in to a newspaper gossip with friend this be nothing new what be new be that in the last several year a lot of this very traditional physical human activity this act of self expression have be move onto the internet and as that be happen person have be leave behind footprint footprint that tell story of they moment of self expression and so what I do be I write computer program that study very large set of this footprint and then try to draw conclusion about the person who leave they what they feel what they think what be different in the world today than usual this sort of question one project that explore this idea which be make about a year ago be a piece call we feel fine this be a piece that every two or three minute scan the world newly post blog entry for occurrence of the phrase I feel or I be feel and when it find one of that phrase it grab the sentence up to the period and then automatically try to deduce the age gender and geographical location of the person that write that sentence then know the geographical location and the time we can also then figure out the weather when that person write the sentence all of this information be save in a database that collect about 20 000 feeling a day it be be run for about a year and a half it be reach about seven and a half million human feeling now and I will show you a glimpse of how this information be then visualize so this be we feel fine what you see here be a madly swarm mass of particle each of which represent a single human feeling that be state in the last few hour the color of each particle correspond to the type of feel inside so that happy positive feeling be brightly color and sad negative feeling be darkly color the diameter of each dot represent the length of the sentence inside so that the large dot contain large sentence and the small dot contain small sentence any dot can be click and expand and we see here I would just feel so much good if I could curl up in he arm right now and feel he affection for I in the embrace of he body and the tenderness of he lip so it get pretty hot and steamy sometimes in the world of human emotion and all of this be state by person I know that objectively it really do not mean much but after spend so many year as a small fish in a big pond it be nice to feel big again the dot exhibit human quality they kind of have they own physics and they swarm wildly around kind of explore the world of life and then they also exhibit curiosity you can see a few of they be swarm around the cursor right now you can see some other one be swarm around the bottom leave corner of the screen around six word that six word represent the six movement of we feel fine we be currently see madness there be also Murmurs Montage Mobs Metrics and Mounds and I will walk you through a few of that now Murmurs cause all of the feeling to fly to the ceiling and then one by one in reverse chronological order they excuse themselves enter the scroll list of feeling I feel a bit good now laughter I feel confused and unsure of what the hell I want to do I feel gyp out of something awesome here I feel so free I feel so good I feel like I be in this fog of depression that I can not get out of and you can click any of this to go out and visit the blog from which it be collect and in that way you can connect with the author of this statement if you feel some degree of empathy the next movement be call Montage Montage cause all of the feeling that contain photograph to become extract and display themselves in a grid this grid be then say to represent the picture of the world feeling in the last few hour if you will each of this can be click and we can blow it up we see I just feel like I be not go to have fun if it be not the both of we that be from someone in Michigan we see I feel like I have be at a computer all day laughter this be automatically construct use the find object I think I feel a little full the next movement be call mob mobs provide different statistical breakdown of the population of the world feeling in the last few hour we see that good be the most frequent feeling right now follow by good bad guilty right down sick and so on we can also get a gender breakdown and we see that woman be slightly more prolific talk about they emotion in the last few hour than man we can do a age breakdown which give we a histogram of the world emotional distribution by age we see person in they twenty be the most prolific follow by teenager and then person in they thirty and it die out very quickly from there in weather the feeling assume the physical characteristic of the weather that they represent so that the one collect on a sunny day swirl around as if they be part of the sun the cloudy one float along as if they be on a breeze the rainy one fall down as if they be in a rainstorm and the snowy one kind of flutter to the ground finally location cause the feeling to move to they position on a world map show the geographical distribution of feeling Metrics provide more numerical view on the datum we see that the world be feel use at 3 3 time the normal level right now laughter they be feel warm at 2 9 time the normal level and so on other view be also available here be gender age weather location the final movement be call Mounds it be a bit different from the other Mounds visualize the entire dataset as large gelatinous blob which kind of jiggle and if I hold down my cursor they do a little dance we see good be the most frequent feeling follow by bad and then if I go over here the list begin to scroll and there be actually thousand of feeling that have be collect you can see the little pink cursor move along represent we position here we see person that feel slip nauseous responsible there be also a search capability if you be interested in find out about a certain population for instance you could find woman who feel addicted in they 20 when it be cloudy in Bangladesh laughter but I will spare you that so here be some of my favorite montage that have be collect I feel so much of my dad alive in I that there be not even room for I I feel very lonely I need to be in some backwoods redneck town so that I can feel beautiful I feel invisible to you I would not hide it if society do not make I feel like I need to I feel in love with Carolyn I feel so naughty I feel this weirdo be actually a asset to college life laughter I love how I feel today so as you can see we feel fine use a technique that I call passive observation what I mean by that be that it passively observe person as they live they life it scan the world blog and look at what person be write and this person do not know they be be watch or interview and because of that you end up get very honest candid sincere response that be often very moving and this be a technique that I usually prefer in my work because person do not know they be be interview they be just live life and they end up just act like that another technique be directly question person and this be a technique that I explore in a different project the Yahoo Time Capsule which be design to take a fingerprint of the world in 2006 it be divide into ten very simple theme love anger sadness and so on each of which contain a single very open end question put to the world what do you love what make you angry what make you sad what do you believe in and so on the time capsule be available for one month online translate into 10 language and this be what it look like it be a spin globe the surface of which be entirely compose of the picture and word and drawing of person that submit to the time capsule the ten theme radiate out and orbit the time capsule you can sift through this data and see what person have submit this be in response to what be beautiful Miss World there be two mode to the time capsule there be one world which present the spinning globe and many Voices which split the datum out into film strip and let you sift through they one by one so this project be punctuate by a really amazing event which be hold in the desert outside Albuquerque in New Mexico at the Jemez Pueblo where for three consecutive night the contents of the capsule be project onto the side of the ancient Red Rock Canyon wall which stand about 200 foot tall it be really incredible and we also project the contents of the time capsule as binary code use a 35 watt laser into outer space you can see the orange line leave the desert floor at about a 45 degree angle there this be amazing because the first night I look at all this information and really start see the gap that I talk about early the difference in age gender and wealth and so on but you know as I look at this more and more and more and see this image go across the rock I realize I be see the same archetypal event depict again and again and again you know wedding birth funeral the first car the first kiss the first camel or horse depend on the culture and it be really move and this picture here be take the final night from a distant cliff about two mile away where the contents of the capsule be be beam into space and there be something very move about all of this human expression be shoot off into the night sky and it start to make I think a lot about the night sky and how human have always use the night sky to project they great story you know as a child in Vermont on a farm where I grow up I would often look up into the dark sky and see the three star belt of Orion the Hunter and as a adult I have be more aware of the great Greek myth play out in the sky overhead every night you know Orion face the roar bull Perseus fly to the rescue of Andromeda Zeus battle Chronos for control of Mount Olympus I mean this be the great tale of the Greek and it cause I to wonder about we world today and it cause I to wonder specifically if we could make new constellation today what would that look like what would that be if we could make new picture in the sky what would we draw what be the great story of today and that be the question that inspire my new project which be debut here today at TED nobody see this yet publicly it be call Universe reveal we modern mythology and it use this metaphor of a interactive night sky so it be my great pleasure now to show this to you so Universe will open here and you will see that it lead with a shift star field and there be a aurora borealis in the background kind of morph with color the color of the aurora borealis can be control use this single bar of color at the bottom and we will put it down here to red so you see this kind of this star move along now this be not just little point of light little pixel each of that star actually represent a specific event in the real world a quote that be state by somebody a image a news story a person a company you know some kind of heroic personality and you might notice that as the cursor begin to touch some of this star that shape begin to emerge we see here there be a little man walk along or maybe a woman and we see here a photograph with a head you can start to see word emerge here and that be the constellation of today and I can turn they all on and you can see they move across the sky now this be the universe of 2007 the last two month the datum from this be global news coverage from thousand of news source around the world it be use the api of a really great company that I work with in New York actually call Daylife and it be kind of the zeitgeist view at this level of the world current mythology over the last couple of month so we can see where it be emerge here like President Ford Iraq Bush and we can actually isolate just the word I call they secret and we can cause they to form a alphabetical list and we see Anna Nicole Smith play a big role recently President Ford this be Gerald Ford funeral we can actually click anything in Universe and have it become the center of the universe and everything else will enter its orbit so we will click Ford and now that become the center and the thing that relate to Ford enter its orbit and swirl around it we can isolate just the photograph and we now see that we can click on one of that and have the photograph be the center of the universe now the thing that relate to it be swirl around we can click on this and we see this iconic image of Betty Ford kiss she husband coffin in Universe there be kind of no end it just go infinitely and you can just kind of click on stuff this be a photographic representation call snapshot but we can actually be more specific in define we universe so if we want to let check out what Bill Clinton universe look like and let see in the past week what he be be up to so now we have a new universe which be just constrain to all thing Bill Clinton we can have he constellation emerge here we can pull out he secret and we see that it have a lot to do with candidate Hillary presidential Barack Obama we can see the story that Bill Clinton be take part in right now any of that can be open up so we see Obama and the Clintons meet in Alabama you can see that this be a important story there be a lot of thing in its orbit if we open this up we get different perspective on this story you can click any of that to go out and read the article at the source this one from Al Jazeera we can also see the superstar this would be the person that be kind of the loom hero and heroine in the universe of Bill Clinton so there be Bill Clinton Hillary Iraq George Bush Barack Obama Scooter Libby this be kind of the person of Bill Clinton we can also see a world map so this show we the geographic reach of Bill Clinton in the last week or so we can see he be be focus in America because he be be campaign probably but a little bit of action over here in the Middle East and then we can also see a timeline so we see that he be a bit quiet on Saturday but he be back to work on Sunday morning and actually be taper off since then this week and it be not limit to just person or date but we can actually put in concept also so if I put in climate change for all of 2006 we will see what that universe look like here we have we star field here we have we shape here we have we secret so we see again climate change be large Nairobi global conference environmental and there be also quote that you can see if you be interested in read about quote on climate change you know this be really a infinite thing the superstar of climate change in 2006 United States Britain China you know this be the towering country that kind of define this concept so this be a piece that demand exploration this will be online in several day probably next Tuesday and you will all be able to use it and kind of explore what you own personal mythology might be you will notice that in Daylife rather in Universe it support both the notion of a global mythology which be represent by something as broad as say 2007 and also a personal mythology as you search for the thing that be important to you in you world and then see what the constellation of that might look like so it be be a pleasure thank you very much applause
