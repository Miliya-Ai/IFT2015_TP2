I be often ask what surprise you about the book and I say that I get to write it I would have never imagine that not in my wildest dream do I think I do not even consider myself to be a author and I be often ask why do you think so many person have read this this thing selling still about a million copy a month and I think it be because spiritual emptiness be a universal disease I think inside at some point we put we head down on the pillow and we go there be get to be more to life than this get up in the morning go to work come home and watch tv go to bed get up in the morning go to work come home watch tv go to bed go to party on weekend a lot of person say I be live no you be not live that be just exist just exist I really think that there be this inner desire I do believe what Chris say I believe that you be not a accident you parent may not have plan you but I believe God do I think there be accidental parent there be no doubt about that I do not think there be accidental kid and I think you matter I think you matter to God I think you matter to history I think you matter to this universe and I think that the difference between what I call the survival level of live the success level of live and the significance level of living be do you figure out what on Earth be I here for I meet a lot of person who be very smart and say but why can not I figure out my problem and I meet a lot of person who be very successful who say why do not I feel more fulfil why do I feel like a fake why do I feel like I have get to pretend that I be more than I really be I think that come down to this issue of meaning of significance of purpose I think it come down to this issue of why be I here what be I here for where be I go this be not religious issue they be human issue I want to tell Michael before he speak that I really appreciate what he do because it make my life work a whole lot easy as a pastor I do see a lot of kook and I have learn that there be kook in every area of life Religion do not have a monopoly on that but there be plenty of religious kook there be secular kook there be smart kook dumb kook there be person a lady come up to I the other day and she have a white piece of paper Michael you will like this one and she say what do you see in it and I look at it and I say oh I do not see anything and she go well I see Jesus and start cry and leave I be go ok you know fine laughter good for you when the book become the good selling book in the world for the last three year I kind of have my little crisis and that be what be the purpose of this because it bring in enormous amount of money when you write the good selling book in the world it be ton and ton of money and it bring in a lot of attention neither of which I want when I start Saddleback Church I be 25 year old I start it with one other family in 1980 and I decide that I be never go to go on tv because I do not want to be a celebrity I do not want to be a quote evangelist televangelist that be not my thing and all of the sudden it bring a lot of money and a lot of attention I do not think now this be a worldview and I will tell you everybody be get a worldview everybody bet they life on something you be bet you life on something you just well know why you be bet what you be bet on so everybody be bet they life on something and when I you know make a bet I happen to believe that Jesus be who he say he be and I believe in a pluralistic society everybody bet on something and when I start the church you know I have no plan to do what it be do now and then when I write this book and all of a sudden it just take off and I start say now what be the purpose of this because as I start to say I do not think you be give money or fame for you own ego ever I just do not believe that and when you write a book that the first sentence of the book be it be not about you then when all of a sudden it become the good selling book in history you have get to figure well I guess it be not about I that be kind of a no brainer so what be it for and I begin to think about what I call the stewardship of affluence and the stewardship of influence so I believe essentially leadership be stewardship that if you be a leader in any area in business in politics in sport in art in academic in any area you do not own it you be a steward of it for instance that be why I believe in protect the environment this be not my planet it be not mine before I be bear it be not go to be mine after I die I be just here for 80 year and then that be it I be debate the other day on a talk show and the guy be challenge I and he would go what be a pastor do on protect the environment and I ask this guy I say well do you believe that human being be responsible to make the world a little bit good place for the next generation do you think we have a stewardship here to take the environment seriously and he say no I say oh you do not I say let I make this clear again do you believe that as human being I be not talk about religion do you believe that as human being it be we responsibility to take care of this planet and make it just a little bit good for the next generation and he say no not any more than any other species when he say the word species he be reveal he worldview and he be say I be no more responsible to take care of this environment than a duck be well now I know a lot of time we act like duck but you be not a duck you be not a duck and you be responsible that be my worldview and so you need to understand what you worldview be the problem be most person never really think it through they never really codify it or qualify it or quantify it and say this be what I believe in this be why I believe what I believe I do not personally have enough faith to be a atheist but you may you may you worldview though do determine everything else in you life because it determine you decision it determine you relationship it determine you level of confidence it determine really everything in you life what we believe obviously and you know this determine we behavior and we behavior determine what we become in life so all of this money start pour in and all of this fame start pour in and I be go what do I do with this my wife and I first make five decision on what to do with the money we say First we be not go to use it on ourselves I do not go out and buy a big house I do not own a guesthouse I still drive the same four year old Ford that I have drive we just say we be not go to use it on we the second thing be I stop take a salary from the church that I pastor third thing be I add up all that the church have pay I over the last 25 year and I give it back and I give it back because I do not want anybody thinking that I do what I do for money I do not in fact personally I have never meet a priest or a pastor or a minister who do it for money I know that be the stereotype I have never meet one of they believe I there be a whole lot easy way to make money pastor be like on 24 hour a day call they be like doctor I leave late today I have hope to be here yesterday because my father in law be in he last probably 48 hour before he die of cancer and I be watch a guy who be live he life he be now in he mid 80 and he be die with peace you know the test of you worldview be not how you act in the good time the test of you worldview be how you act at the funeral and have be through literally hundred if not thousand of funeral it make a difference it make a difference what you believe so we give it all back and then we set up three foundation work on some of the major problem of the world illiteracy poverty pandemic disease particularly HIV AIDS and set up this three foundation and put the money into that the last thing we do be we become what I call reverse tither and that be when my wife and I get married 30 year ago we start tithe now that be a principle in the Bible that say give 10 percent of what you get back to charity give it away to help other person so we start do that and each year we would raise we tithe one percent so we first year of marriage we go to 11 percent second year we go to 12 percent and the third year we go to 13 percent and on and on and on why do I do that because every time I give it break the grip of materialism in my life Materialism be all about get get get get get all you can can all you get sit on the can and spoil the rest it be all about more have more and we think that the good life be actually look good that be most important of all look good feeling good and have the goods but that be not the good life I meet person all the time who have that and they be not necessarily happy if money actually make you happy then the wealthy person in the world would be the happy and that I know personally I know be not true it be just not true so the good life be not about look good feeling good or have the goods it be about be good and do good give you life away significance in life do not come from status because you can always find somebody who be get more than you it do not come from sex it do not come from salary it come from serve it be in give we life away that we find mean we find significance that be the way we be wire I believe by God and so we begin to give away and now after 30 year my wife and I be reverse tither we give away 90 percent and live on 10 that actually be the easy part the hard part be what do I do with all this attention because I start get all kind of invitation I just come off a nearly month long speaking tour on three different continent and I will not go into that but it be a amazing thing and I be go what do I do with this notoriety that the book have bring and be a pastor I start read the Bible there be a chapter in the Bible call Psalm 72 and it be Solomon prayer for more influence when you read this prayer it sound incredibly selfish self center he say God I want you to make I famous that be what he pray he say I want you to make I famous I want you to spread the fame of my name through every land I want you to give I power I want you to make I famous I want you to give I influence and it just sound like the most egotistical request you could make if you be go to pray until you read the whole psalm the whole chapter and then he say so that the king he be the king of Israel at that time at its apex in power so that the king may care for the widow and orphan support the oppressed defend the defenseless care for the sick assist the poor speak up for the foreigner that in prison basically he be talk about all the marginalize in society and as I read that I look at it and I think you know what this be say be that the purpose of influence be to speak up for that who have no influence the purpose of influence be not to build you ego or you net worth and by the way you net worth be not the same thing as you self worth you value be not base on you valuable it be base on a whole different set of thing and so the purpose of influence be to speak up for that who have no influence and I have to admit I can not think of the last time I think of widow and orphan they be not on my radar i pastor a church in one of the most affluent area of America a bunch of gate community I have a church full of ceo and scientist and I could go five year and never ever see a homeless person they be just not in my pathway now they be 13 mile up the road in Santa Ana so I have to say ok I would use whatever affluence and whatever influence I have get to help that who do not have either of that you know there be a story in the Bible about Moses whether you believe it be true or not it really do not matter to I but Moses if you see the movie the ten commandment Moses go out and there be this burn bush and God talk to he and God say Moses what be in you hand I think that be one of the most important question you will ever be ask what be in you hand Moses say it be a staff it be a shepherd staff and God say throw it down and if you see the movie you know he throw it down and it become a snake and then God say pick it up and he pick it back up again and it become a staff again now I be read this thing and I be go what be that all about ok what be that all about well I do know a couple of thing number one God never do a miracle to show off it be not just wow be not that cool and by the way my God do not have to show up on cheese bread you know if God be go to show up he be not go to show up on cheese bread laughter ok I just this be why I love what Michael do because it be like if he be debunk it then I do not have to but God my God do not show up on sprinkler image he be get a few more powerful way than that to do whatever he want to do but he do not do miracle just to show off second thing be if God ever ask you a question he already know the answer obviously if he be God then that would mean that when he ask the question it be for you benefit not he so he be go what be in you hand now what be in Moses hand well it be a shepherd staff now follow I on this this staff represent three thing about Moses life first it represent he identity he be a shepherd it be the symbol of he own occupation I be a shepherd it be a symbol of he identity he career he job second it be a symbol of not only he identity it be a symbol of he income because all of he asset be tie up in sheep in that day nobody have bank account or American Express card or hedge fund you asset be tie up in you flock so it be a symbol of he identity and it be a symbol of he income and the third thing it be a symbol of he influence what do you do with a shepherd staff well you know you move sheep from point a to point b with it by hook or by crook you pull they or you poke they one or the other so he be say you be go to lay down you identity what be in you hand you have get identity you have get income you have get influence what be in you hand and he be say if you lay it down I will make it come alive I will do some thing you could never imagine possible and if you have watch that movie ten commandment all of that big miracle that happen in Egypt be do through this staff last year I be invite to speak at the NBA All Stars game and so I be talk to the player because most of the NBA team NFL team and all the other team have do this 40 day of purpose base on the book and I ask they I say what be in you hand so what be in you hand I say it be a basketball and that basketball represent you identity who you be you be a NBA player it represent you income you be make a lot of money off that little ball and it represent you influence and even though you be only go to be in the NBA for a few year you be go to be a NBA player for the rest of you life and that give you enormous influence so what be you go to do with what you have be give and I guess that be the main reason I come up here today to all of you very bright person at TED it be to say what be in you hand what do you have that you have be give talent background education freedom network opportunity wealth idea creativity what be you do with what you have be give that to I be the primary question about life that to I be what be purpose drive be all about in the book I talk about how you be wire to do certain thing you be shape with a little acrostic spiritual gift heart ability personality and experience this thing shape you and if you want to know what you ought to be do with you life you need to look at you shape what be I wire to do why would God wire you to do something and then not have you do it if you be wire to be a anthropologist you will be a anthropologist if you be wire to be a undersea explorer you will be a undersea explorer if you be wire to make deal you make deal if you be wire to paint you paint do you know that God smile when you be you when my little kid when my kid be little they be all grow now I have grandkid I use to go in and sit on the side of they bed and I use to watch my kid sleep and I just watch they little body rise and low rise and low and I would look at they this be not a accident rise and low and I get joy out of just watch they sleep some person have the misguided idea that God only get excited when you be do quote spiritual thing like go to church or help the poor or you know confess or do something like that the bottom line be God get pleasure watch you be you why he make you and when you do what you be make to do he go that be my boy that be my girl you be use the talent and ability that I give you so my advice to you be look at what be in you hand you identity you influence you income and say it be not about I it be about make the world a good place thank you
