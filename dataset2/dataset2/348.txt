we all make decision every day we want to know what the right thing be to do in domain from the financial to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic and surely if somebody could really tell we how to do exactly the right thing at all possible time that would be a tremendous gift it turn out that in fact the world be give this gift in 1738 by a dutch polymath name Daniel Bernoulli and what I want to talk to you about today be what that gift be and I also want to explain to you why it be that it have not make a damn bit of difference now this be Bernoulli gift this be a direct quote and if it look like Greek to you it be because well it be Greek but the simple English translation much less precise but it capture the gist of what Bernoulli have to say be this the expect value of any of we action that be the goodness that we can count on get be the product of two simple thing the odds that this action will allow we to gain something and the value of that gain to we in a sense what Bernoulli be say be if we can estimate and multiply this two thing we will always know precisely how we should behave now this simple equation even for that of you who do not like equation be something that you be quite used to here be a example if I be to tell you let play a little coin toss game and I be go to flip a coin and if it come up head I be go to pay you 10 dollar but you have to pay four dollar for the privilege of play with I most of you would say sure I will take that bet because you know that the odds of you win be one half the gain if you do be 10 dollar that multiply to five and that be more than I be charge you to play so the answer be yes this be what statistician technically call a damn fine bet now the idea be simple when we be apply it to coin toss but in fact it be not very simple in everyday life person be horrible at estimate both of this thing and that be what I want to talk to you about today there be two kind of error person make when try to decide what the right thing be to do and that be error in estimate the odds that they be go to succeed and error in estimate the value of they own success now let I talk about the first one first calculate odds would seem to be something rather easy there be six side to a die two side to a coin 52 card in a deck you all know what the likelihood be of pull the ace of spade or of flip a head but as it turn out this be not a very easy idea to apply in everyday life that be why American spend more I should say lose more gambling than on all other form of entertainment combine the reason be this be not how person do odds the way person figure odds require that we first talk a bit about pig now the question I be go to put to you be whether you think there be more dog or pig on leash observe in any particular day in Oxford and of course you all know that the answer be dog and the way that you know that the answer be dog be you quickly review in memory the time you have see dog and pig on leash it be very easy to remember see dog not so easy to remember pig and each one of you assume that if dog on leash come more quickly to you mind then dog on leash be more probable that be not a bad rule of thumb except when it be so for example here be a word puzzle be there more four letter English word with r in the third place or r in the first place well you check memory very briefly make a quick scan and it be awfully easy to say to yourself Ring Rang Rung and very hard to say to yourself pare Park they come more slowly but in fact there be many more word in the English language with r in the third than the first place the reason word with r in the third place come slowly to you mind be not because they be improbable unlikely or infrequent it be because the mind recall word by they first letter you kind of shout out the sound s and the word come it be like the dictionary it be hard to look thing up by the third letter so this be a example of how this idea that the quickness with which thing come to mind can give you a sense of they probability how this idea could lead you astray it be not just puzzle though for example when American be ask to estimate the odds that they will die in a variety of interesting way this be estimate of number of death per year per 200 million U S citizen and this be just ordinary person like yourselve who be ask to guess how many person die from tornado firework asthma drown etc compare this to the actual number now you see a very interesting pattern here which be first of all two thing be vastly over estimate namely tornado and firework two thing be vastly underestimate die by drown and die by asthma why when be the last time that you pick up a newspaper and the headline be Boy die of Asthma it be not interesting because it be so common it be very easy for all of we to bring to mind instance of news story or newsreel where we have see tornado devastating city or some poor schmuck who be blow he hand off with a firework on the Fourth of July Drownings and asthma death do not get much coverage they do not come quickly to mind and as a result we vastly underestimate they indeed this be kind of like the Sesame Street game of which thing do not belong and you be right to say it be the swimming pool that do not belong because the swimming pool be the only thing on this slide that be actually very dangerous the way that more of you be likely to die than the combination of all three of the other that you see on the slide the lottery be a excellent example of course a excellent test case of person ability to compute probability and economist forgive I for that of you who play the lottery but economist at least among themselves refer to the lottery as a stupidity tax because the odds of get any payoff by invest you money in a lottery ticket be approximately equivalent to flush the money directly down the toilet which by the way do not require that you actually go to the store and buy anything why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery well there be many answer but one answer surely be we see a lot of winner right when this couple win the lottery or Ed McMahon show up at you door with this giant check how the hell do you cash thing that size I do not know we see this on tv we read about it in the paper when be the last time that you see extensive interview with everybody who lose indeed if we require that television station run a 30 second interview with each loser every time they interview a winner the 100 million loser in the last lottery would require nine and a half year of you undivided attention just to watch they say I I lose I I lose now if you watch nine and a half year of television no sleep no potty break and you see loss after loss after loss and then at the end there be 30 second of and I win the likelihood that you would play the lottery be very small look I can prove this to you here be a little lottery there be 10 ticket in this lottery nine of they have be sell to this individual it cost you a dollar to buy the ticket and if you win you get 20 buck be this a good bet well Bernoulli tell we it be the expect value of this lottery be two dollar this be a lottery in which you should invest you money and most person say ok I will play now a slightly different version of this lottery imagine that the nine ticket be all own by one fat guy name Leroy Leroy have nine ticket there be one leave do you want it most person will not play this lottery now you can see the odds of win have not change but it be now fantastically easy to imagine who be go to win it be easy to see Leroy get the check right you can not say to yourself I be as likely to win as anybody because you be not as likely to win as Leroy the fact that all that ticket be own by one guy change you decision to play even though it do nothing whatsoever to the odds now estimate odds as difficult as it may seem be a piece of cake compare to try to estimate value try to say what something be worth how much we will enjoy it how much pleasure it will give we I want to talk now about error in value how much be this big Mac worth be it worth 25 dollar most of you have the intuition that it be not you would not pay that for it but in fact to decide whether a Big Mac be worth 25 dollar require that you ask one and only one question which be what else can I do with 25 dollar if you have ever get on one of that long haul flight to Australia and realize that they be not go to serve you any food but somebody in the row in front of you have just open the McDonald bag and the smell of golden arch be waft over the seat you think I can not do anything else with this 25 dollar for 16 hour I can not even set it on fire they take my cigarette light suddenly 25 dollar for a Big Mac might be a good deal on the other hand if you be visit a underdeveloped country and 25 dollar buy you a gourmet meal it be exorbitant for a Big Mac why be you all sure that the answer to the question be no before I have even tell you anything about the context because most of you compare the price of this Big Mac to the price you be use to pay rather than ask what else can I do with my money compare this investment to other possible investment you compare to the past and this be a systematic error person make what you know be you pay three dollar in the past 25 be outrageous this be a error and I can prove it to you by show the kind of irrationality to which it lead for example this be of course one of the most delicious trick in marketing be to say something use to be high and suddenly it seem like a very good deal when person be ask about this two different job a job where you make 60K then 50k then 40k a job where you be get a salary cut each year and one in which you be get a salary increase person like the second job good than the first despite the fact they be all tell they make much less money why because they have the sense that decline wages be bad than rise wages even when the total amount of wages be high in the decline period here be another nice example here be a 2 000 hawaiian vacation package it be now on sale for 1 600 assume you want to go to Hawaii would you buy this package most person say they would here be a slightly different story 2 000 hawaiian vacation package be now on sale for 700 dollar so you decide to mull it over for a week by the time you get to the ticket agency the good fare be go the package now cost 1 500 would you buy it most person say no why because it use to cost 700 and there be no way I be pay 1 500 for something that be 700 last week this tendency to compare to the past be cause person to pass up the good deal in other word a good deal that use to be a great deal be not nearly as good as a awful deal that be once a horrible deal here be another example of how compare to the past can befuddle we decision imagine that you be go to the theater you be on you way to the theater in you wallet you have a ticket for which you pay 20 dollar you also have a 20 dollar bill when you arrive at the theater you discover that somewhere along the way you have lose the ticket would you spend you remain money on replace it most person answer no now let just change one thing in this scenario you be on you way to the theater and in you wallet you have two 20 dollar bill when you arrive you discover you have lose one of they would you spend you remain 20 dollar on a ticket well of course I go to the theater to see the play what do the loss of 20 dollar along the way have to do now just in case you be not get it here be a schematic of what happen ok laughter along the way you lose something in both case it be a piece of paper in one case it have a u s president on it in the other case it do not what the hell difference should it make the difference be that when you lose the ticket you say to yourself I be not pay twice for the same thing you compare the cost of the play now 40 dollar to the cost that it use to have 20 dollar and you say it be a bad deal compare with the past cause many of the problem that behavioral economist and psychologist identify in person attempt to assign value but even when we compare with the possible instead of the past we still make certain kind of mistake and I be go to show you one or two of they one of the thing we know about comparison that when we compare one thing to the other it change its value so in 1992 this fellow George Bush for that of we who be kind of on the liberal side of the political spectrum do not seem like such a great guy suddenly we be almost longing for he to return laughter the comparison change how we evaluate he now retailer know this long before anybody else do of course and they use this wisdom to help you spare you the undue burden of money and so a retailer if you be to go into a wine shop and you have to buy a bottle of wine and you see they here for eight 27 and 33 dollar what would you do most person do not want the most expensive they do not want the least expensive so they will opt for the item in the middle if you be a smart retailer then you will put a very expensive item that nobody will ever buy on the shelf because suddenly the 33 wine do not look as expensive in comparison so I be tell you something you already know namely that comparison change the value of thing here be why that be a problem the problem be that when you get that 33 bottle of wine home it will not matter what it use to be sit on the shelf next to the comparison we make when we be appraise value where we be try to estimate how much we will like thing be not the same comparison we will be make when we consume they this problem of shift comparison can bedevil we attempt to make rational decision let I just give you a example I have to show you something from my own lab so let I sneak this in this be subject come to a experiment to be ask the simple of all question how much will you enjoy eat potato chip one minute from now they be sit in a room with potato chip in front of they for some of the subject sit in the far corner of a room be a box of Godiva chocolate and for other be a can of Spam in fact this item that be sit in the room change how much the subject think they be go to enjoy the potato chip namely that who be look at Spam think potato chip be go to be quite tasty that who be look at Godiva chocolate think they will not be nearly so tasty of course what happen when they eat the potato chip well look you do not need a psychologist to tell you that when you have a mouthful of greasy salty crispy delicious snack what be sit in the corner of the room make not a damn bit of difference to you gustatory experience nonetheless they prediction be pervert by a comparison that then do not carry through and change they experience you have all experience this yourself even if you have never come into we lab to eat potato chip so here be a question you want to buy a car stereo the dealer near you house sell this particular stereo for 200 dollar but if you drive across town you can get it for 100 buck so would you drive to get 50 percent off save 100 dollar most person say they would they can not imagine buy it for twice the price when with one trip across town they can get it for half off now let imagine instead you want to buy a car that have a stereo and the dealer near you house have it for 31 000 but if you drive across town you could get it for 30 900 would you drive to get it at this point 0 003 savings the 100 dollar most person say no I be go to schlep across town to save 100 buck on the purchase of a car this kind of think drive economist crazy and it should because this 100 dollar that you save hello do not know where it come from it do not know what you save it on when you go to buy grocery with it it do not go I be the money save on the car stereo or I be the dumb money save on the car it be money and if a drive across town be worth 100 buck it be worth 100 buck no matter what you be save it on person do not think that way that be why they do not know whether they mutual fund manager be take 0 1 percent or 0 15 percent of they investment but they clip coupon to save one dollar off of toothpaste now you can see this be the problem of shift comparison because what you be do be you be compare the 100 buck to the purchase that you be make but when you go to spend that money you will not be make that comparison you have all have this experience if you be a American for example you have probably travel in France and at some point you may have meet a couple from you own hometown and you think oh my god this person be so warm they be so nice to I I mean compare to all this person who hate I when I try to speak they language and hate I more when I do not this person be just wonderful and so you tour France with they and then you get home and you invite they over for dinner and what do you find compare to you regular friend they be boring and dull right because in this new context the comparison be very very different in fact you find yourself dislike they enough almost to qualify for French citizenship now you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo you go to the stereo store you see two set of speaker this big boxy monolith and this little sleek speaker and you play they and you go you know I do hear a difference the big one sound a little good and so you buy they and you bring they home and you entirely violate the d cor of you house and the problem of course be that this comparison you make in the store be a comparison you will never make again what be the odds that year late you will turn on the stereo and go sound so much good than that little one which you can not even remember hear the problem of shift comparison be even more difficult when this choice be array over time person have a lot of trouble make decision about thing that will happen at different point in time and what psychologist and behavioral economist have discover be that by and large person use two simple rule so let I give you one very easy problem a second very easy problem and then a third hard problem here be the first easy problem you can have 60 dollar now or 50 dollar now which would you prefer this be what we call a one item iq test ok all of we I hope prefer more money and the reason be we believe more be good than less here be the second problem you can have 60 dollar today or 60 dollar in a month which would you prefer again a easy decision because we all know that now be good than later what be hard in we decision making be when this two rule conflict for example when you be offer 50 dollar now or 60 dollar in a month this typify a lot of situation in life in which you will gain by wait but you have to be patient what do we know what do person do in this kind of situation well by and large person be enormously impatient that be they require interest rate in the hundred or thousand of percent in order to delay gratification and wait until next month for the extra 10 dollar maybe that be not so remarkable but what be remarkable be how easy it be to make this impatience go away by simply change when the delivery of this monetary unit will happen imagine that you can have 50 dollar in a year that be 12 month or 60 dollar in 13 month what do we find now person be gladly willing to wait as long as they be wait 12 they might as well wait 13 what make this dynamic inconsistency happen comparison troubling comparison let I show you this be just a graph show the result that I just suggest you would show if I give you time to respond which be person find that the subjective value of 50 be high than the subjective value of 60 when they will be deliver in now or one month respectively a 30 day delay but they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision off into the future a year now why in the world do you get this pattern of result this guy can tell we what you see here be two lad one of they large than the other the fireman and the fiddler they be go to recede towards the vanish point in the horizon and I want you to notice two thing at no point will the fireman look tall than the fiddler no point however the difference between they seem to be get small first it be a inch in you view then it be a quarter inch then a half inch and then finally they go off the edge of the earth here be the result of what I just show you this be the subjective height the height you see of this guy at various point and I want you to see that two thing be true one the far away they be the small they look and two the fireman be always big than the fiddler but watch what happen when we make some of they disappear right at a very close distance the fiddler look tall than the fireman but at a far distance they normal they true relation be preserve as Plato say what space be to size time be to value this be the result of the hard problem I give you 60 now or 50 in a month and this be subjective value and what you can see be we two rule be preserve person always think more be good than less 60 be always good than 50 and they always think now be good than later the bar on this side be high than the bar on this side watch what happen when we drop some out suddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzle we we have the tendency for person to go for 50 dollar now over wait a month but not if that decision be far in the future notice something interesting that this imply namely that when person get to the future they will change they mind that be as that month 12 approach you will say what be I think wait a extra month for 60 dollar I will take the 50 dollar now well the question with which I have like to end be this if we be so damn stupid how do we get to the moon because I could go on for about two hour with evidence of person inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value the answer to this question I think be a answer you have already hear in some of the talk and I dare say you will hear again namely that we brain be evolve for a very different world than the one in which we be live they be evolve for a world in which person live in very small group rarely meet anybody who be terribly different from themselves have rather short life in which there be few choice and the high priority be to eat and mate today Bernoulli gift Bernoulli little formula allow we it tell we how we should think in a world for which nature never design we that explain why we be so bad at use it but it also explain why it be so terribly important that we become good fast we be the only species on this planet that have ever hold its own fate in its hand we have no significant predator we be the master of we physical environment the thing that normally cause species to become extinct be no long any threat to we the only thing the only thing that can destroy we and doom we be we own decision if we be not here in 10 000 year it be go to be because we could not take advantage of the gift give to we by a young dutch fellow in 1738 because we underestimate the odds of we future pain and overestimate the value of we present pleasure thank you applause Chris Anderson that be remarkable we have time for some question for Dan Gilbert one and two Bill Lyell would you say that this mechanism be in part how terrorism actually work to frighten we and be there some way that we could counteract that Dan Gilbert I actually be consult recently with the Department of Homeland Security which generally believe that American security dollar should go to make border safe I try to point out to they that terrorism be a name base on person psychological reaction to a set of event and that if they be concern about terrorism they might ask what cause terror and how can we stop person from be terrify rather than not rather than but in addition to stop the atrocity that we be all concern about surely the kind of play that at least American media give to and forgive I but in raw number this be very tiny accident we already know for example in the United States more person have die as a result of not take airplane because they be scared and drive on highway than be kill in 9 11 ok if I tell you that there be a plague that be go to kill 15 000 American next year you might be alarm if you do not find out it be the flu this be small scale accident and we should be wonder whether they should get the kind of play the kind of coverage that they do surely that cause person to overestimate the likelihood that they will be hurt in this various way and give power to the very person who want to frighten we CA Dan I would like to hear more on this so you be say that we response to terror be I mean it be a form of mental bug talk more about it DG it be out sized I mean look if Australia disappear tomorrow terror be probably the right response that be a awful large lot of very nice person on the other hand when a bus blow up and 30 person be kill more person than that be kill by not use they seatbelt in the same country be terror the right response can what cause the bug be it the drama of the event that it be so spectacular be it the fact that it be a intentional attack by quote outsider what be it DG yes it be a number of thing and you hit on several of they first it be a human agent try to kill we it be not a tree fall on we by accident second this be enemy who may want to strike and hurt we again People be be kill for no reason instead of good reason as if there be good reason but sometimes person think there be so there be a number of thing that together make this seem like a fantastic event but let not play down the fact that newspaper sell when person see something in it they want to read so there be a large role here play by the media who want this thing to be as spectacular as they possibly can CA I mean what would it take to persuade we culture to downplay it DG well go to Israel you know go to Israel and a mall blow up and then everybody unhappy about it and a hour and a half later at least when I be there and I be 150 foot from the mall when it blow up I go back to my hotel and the wedding that be plan be still go on and as the Israeli mother say she say we never let they win by stop wedding I mean this be a society that have learn and there be other too that have learn to live with a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it shall I say as that of we who have not have many terror attack can but be there a rational fear that actually the reason we be frightened about this be because we think that the big one be to come DG Yes of course so if we know that this be the bad attack there would ever be there might be more and more bus of 30 person we would probably not be nearly so frightened I do not want to say please I be go to get quote somewhere as say Terrorism be fine and we should not be so distressed that be not my point at all what I be say be that surely rationally we distress about thing that happen about threat should be roughly proportional to the size of that threat and threat to come I think in the case of terrorism it be not and many of the thing we have hear about from we speaker today how many person do you know get up and say poverty I can not believe what poverty be do to we People get up in the morning they do not care about poverty it be not make headline it be not make news it be not flashy there be no gun go off I mean if you have to solve one of this problem Chris which would you solve Terrorism or poverty laughter applause that be a tough one can there be no question poverty by a order of magnitude a huge order of magnitude unless someone can show that there be you know terrorist with a nuke be really likely to come the late I have read see thought be that it be incredibly hard for they to do that if that turn out to be wrong we all look silly but with poverty it be a bit DG even if that be true still more person die from poverty can we have evolve to get all excited about this dramatic attack be that because in the past in the ancient past we just do not understand thing like disease and system that cause poverty and so forth and so it make no sense for we as a species to put any energy into worry about that thing person die so be it but if you get attack that be something you could do something about and so we evolve this response be that what happen DG well you know the person who be most skeptical about leap to evolutionary explanation for everything be the evolutionary psychologist themselves my guess be that there be nothing quite that specific in we evolutionary past but rather if you be look for a evolutionary explanation you might say that most organism be neo phobic that be they be a little scared of stuff that be new and different and there be a good reason to be because old stuff do not eat you right any animal you see that you have see before be less likely to be a predator than one that you have never see before so you know when a school bus be blow up and we have never see this before we general tendency be to orient towards that which be new and novel be activate I do not think it be quite as specific a mechanism as the one you allude to but maybe a more fundamental one underlie it Jay Walker you know economist love to talk about the stupidity of person who buy lottery ticket but I suspect you be make the exact same error you be accuse that person of which be the error of value I know because I have interview about 1 000 lottery buyer over the year it turn out that the value of buy a lottery ticket be not win that be what you think it be all right the average lottery buyer buy about 150 ticket a year so the buyer know full well that he or she be go to lose and yet she buy 150 ticket a year why be that it be not because she be stupid or he be stupid it be because the anticipation of possibly win release serotonin in the brain and actually provide a good feeling until the drawing indicate you have lose or to put it another way for the dollar investment you can have a much good feeling than flush the money down the toilet which you can not have a good feeling from now economist tend to applause economist tend to view the world through they own lens which be this be just a bunch of stupid person and as a result many person look at economist as stupid person and so fundamentally the reason we get to the moon be we do not listen to the economist thank you very much applause DG well no it be a great point it remain to be see whether the joy of anticipation be exactly equal by the amount of disappointment after the lottery because remember person who do not buy ticket do not feel awful the next day either even though they do not feel great during the drawing I would disagree that person know they be not go to win I think they think it be unlikely but it could happen which be why they prefer that to the flush but certainly I see you point that there can be some utility to buy a lottery ticket other than win now I think there be many good reason not to listen to economist that be not one of they for I but there be many other ca last question Aubrey de Grey my name Aubrey de Grey from Cambridge I work on the thing that kill more person than anything else kill I work on age and I be interested in do something about it as we will all hear tomorrow I very much resonate with what you be say because it seem to I that the problem with get person interested in do anything about age be that by the time age be about to kill you it look like cancer or heart disease or whatever do you have any advice laughter DG for you or for they adg in persuade they DG Ah for you in persuade they well it be notoriously difficult to get person to be farsighted but one thing that psychologist have try that seem to work be to get person to imagine the future more vividly one of the problem with make decision about the far future and the near future be that we imagine the near future much more vividly than the far future to the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail that person put into the mental representation of near and far future person begin to make decision about the two in the same way so would you like to have a extra 100 000 dollar when you be 65 be a question that be very different than imagine who you will be when you be 65 will you be live what will you look like how much hair will you have who will you be live with once we have all the detail of that imaginary scenario suddenly we feel like it might be important to save so that that guy have a little retirement money but this be trick around the margin I think in general you be battle a very fundamental human tendency which be to say I be here today and so now be more important than later CA Dan thank you member of the audience that be a fantastic session thank you applause
