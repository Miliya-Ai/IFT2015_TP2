I do not know what the hell I be do here I be bear in a Scots Presbyterian ghetto in Canada and drop out of high school I do not own a cell phone and I paint on paper use gouache which have not change in 600 year but about three year ago I have a art show in New York and I title it serious nonsense so I think I be actually the first one here I lead I call it serious nonsense because on the serious side I use a technique of painstaking realism of editorial illustration from when I be a kid I copy it and I never unlearned it it be the only style I know and it be very kind of staid and formal and meanwhile I use nonsense as you can see this be a Scottish castle where person be play golf indoor and the trick be to bang the golf ball off of suit of armor which you can not see there this be one of a series call Zany afternoon which become a book this be a home build rocket propel car that be a 1953 Henry J I be a bug for authenticity in a quiet neighborhood in Toledo this be my submission for the L A Museum of Film you can probably tell Frank Gehry and I come from the same town my work be so personal and so strange that I have to invent my own lexicon for it and I work a lot in what I call retrofuturism which be look back to see how yesterday view tomorrow and they be always wrong always hilariously optimistically wrong and the peak time for that be the 30 because the Depression be so dismal that anything to get away from the present into the future and technology be go to carry we along this be Popular Workbench Popular science magazine in that day I have a huge collection of they from the 30 all they be be just poor person be ask to make sunglass out of wire coat hanger and everything improvise and dream about this wonderful giant radio robot play ice hockey at 300 mile a hour it be all go to happen it be all go to be wonderful Automotive retrofuturism be one of my specialty I be both a automobile illustrator and a advertising automobile copywriter so I have a lot of revenge to take on the subject Detroit have always be halfway into the future the advertising half this be the 58 Bulgemobile so new they make tomorrow look like yesterday this be a chain gang of guy admire the car that be from a whole catalog it be 18 page or so run back in the day of the Lampoon where I cut my tooth Techno archaeology be dig back and find past miracle that never happen for good reason usually the zeppelin this be from a brochure about the zeppelin base obviously on the Hindenburg but the zeppelin be the big thing that ever move make by man and it carry 56 person at the speed of a Buick at a altitude you could hear dog bark and it cost twice as much as a first class cabin on the Normandie to fly it so the Hindenburg be not you know it be inevitable it be go to go this be auto gyro jousting in Malibu in the 30 the auto gyro could not wait for the invention of the helicopter but it should have it be not a big success it be the only Spanish innovation technologically of the 20th century by the way you need to know that the fly car which never get off the ground it be a post war dream my old man use to tell I we be go to get a fly car this be pitch into the future from 1946 look at the day all American family have they there be Moscow Shirley hope they speak esperanto faux nostalgia which I be sort of not say famous for but I work a awful lot in it it be the achingly sentimental yearning for time that never happen somebody once say that nostalgia be the one utterly most useless human emotion so I think that a case for serious play this be emblematic of it this be wing dining recall that balmy summer day somewhere over France in the 20 dining on the wing of a plane you can not see it very well here but that be Hemingway read some page from he new novel to Fitzgerald and Ford Madox Ford until the slipstream blow he away this be tank polo in the South Hamptons the brainless rich be more fun to make fun of than anybody I do a lot of that and authenticity be a major part of my serious nonsense I think it add a huge amount that for example be Mark IV British tank from 1916 they have two machine gun and a cannon and they have 90 horsepower Ricardo engine they go five mile a hour and inside it be 105 degree in the pitch dark and they have a canary hang inside the thing to make sure the German be not go to use gas happy little story be not it this be motor Ritz Towers in Manhattan in the 30 where you drive up to you front door if you have the gut anybody who be anybody have a apartment there I manage to stick in both the zeppelin and a ocean liner out of sheer enthusiasm and I love cigar there be a cigar billboard down there and faux nostalgia work even in serious subject like war this be that wonderful day of the battle of Britain in 1940 when a Messerschmitt me109 burst into the House of Commons and buzz around just to piss off Churchill who be down there somewhere it be a fond memory of time past hyperbolic overkill be a way of take exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit just for the fun of it this be a piece I do a brochure again RMS Tyrannic the big thing in all the World the copy which you can not see because it go on and on for several page say that steerage passenger can not get they to bunk before the voyage be over and it be so safe it carry no insurance it be obviously model on the Titanic but it be not a cri de coeur about man hubri in the face of the element it be just a sick silly joke shamelessly cheap be something I think this will wake you up it have no meaning just Desoto discover the Mississippi and it be a desoto discover the Mississippi I do that as a quick back page I have like four hour to do a back page for a issue of the Lampoon and I do that and I think well I be ashamed I hope nobody know it person write in for reprint of that thing urban absurdism that be what the New Yorker really call for I try to make life in New York look even weird than it be with that cover I have do about 40 of they and I would say 30 of they be base on that concept I be drive down 7th Avenue one night at 3 a m and this steam pour out of the street and I think what cause that and that who to say the Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan in New York it be a very somber place I think I could jazz it up a bit have a little fun with it this be a very un pc cover not in New York I could not resist and I get a nasty email from some environmental group say this be too serious and solemn to make fun of you should be ashamed please apologize on we website have not get around to it yet but I may this be the word side of my brain laughter I love the word eurotrash laughter that be all the Eurotrash come through JFK custom this be the New York bike messenger meet the Tour de France if you live in New York you know how the bike messenger move except that he be carry a tube for blueprint and stuff they all do and a lot of person think that mean it be a terrorist about to shoot rocket at the Tour de France sign of we time I guess this be the only fashion cover I have ever do it be the little old lady that live in a shoe and then this thing the title of that be there go the Neighborhood I do not know a hell of a lot about fashion I be tell to do what they call a Mary Jane and then I get into this terrible fight between the art director and the editor say put a strap on it no do not put a strap on it put a strap on it do not put a strap on it because it obscure the logo and look terrible and it be bad and I finally chicken out and do it for the sake of the authenticity of the shoe this be a tiny joke e zr pass one letter make a idea this be a big joke this be the audition for King Kong laughter person always ask I where do you get you idea how do you idea come Truth about that one be I have a horrible red wine hangover in the middle of the night this come to I like a Xerox all I have to do be write it down it be perfectly clear I do not do any thinking about it and then when it run a lovely lady a old lady name Mrs Edgar Rosenberg if you know that name call I and say she love the cover it be so sweet she former name be Fay Wray and so that be I do not have the wit to say take the painting finally this be a three page cover never do before and I do not think it will ever be do again successive page in the front of the magazine it be the ascent of man use a escalator and it be in three part you can not see it all together unfortunately but if you look at it enough you can sort of start to see how it actually start to move applause pretty elegant nothing like a crash to end a joke that complete my oeuvre I would just like to add a crass commercial I have a kid book come out in the fall call Marvel Sandwiches a compendium of all the serious play that ever be and it go to be available in fine bookstore crummy bookstore table on the street in October so thank you very much
