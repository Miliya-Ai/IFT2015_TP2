ninety nine percent of we have the dream of listener not be the musician the listener right and we crave one thing even though we kind of do not know it all the time we crave to be in the room with the musician the day it be record the day it be play and we go to live concert and we get that as much as we can but then we listen to the other 99 percent of we stuff record and it turn out the far back you go in history the little rough it sound and so we say there be a solution to this let separate the performance as a thing out from the recording which be how it be make you know the thing with microphone in the room and all that day but the performance itself be how the musician work they finger and what instrument they be use and it be the datum hide inside the recording in order to do this it be a lot of hardware and software that run in a very high resolution and Yamaha make a incredible thing call the Disklavier Pro that look like a nice grand piano there and you probably do not realize it be go to do all this thing but full of solenoid and fiber optics and computer and all this kind of stuff the high resolution out of Japan and this just do not work until we could cross this line that say high definition and we be able to cross this line call the uncanny valley in term of artificial intelligence term we have a process where we you know kind of put it into the computer and digitize it and then a whole lot of analysis and we look at every single note and all the attribute of that note how hard they be strike and how they be hold down and how you move the finger so we have to develop a whole new science of how you move you finger and you know it be a thing you piano teacher teach you but we never have a science behind this kind of thing I be go to start with Glenn Gould he die 25 year ago this year and be bear 75 year ago this year be a beloved pianist maybe the great cult pianist of the twentieth century he just get tired of be in front of a audience and feel like a perform monkey be in fact he term so he step back and do nothing but the craft of he work and Gould specialty be play Bach he maybe most famous recording be something call the Goldberg Variations Bach only write theme and variation one time he write some early piece but late in he life in he mature period he say here be a theme 30 variation in fact the theme be not even the melody it be the bass line and Gould record it in two major recording that you may know about one in mono and one in stereo and the one in mono by the way he use the pedal and as he get old he say no no wait a minute I be go to get very scientific about this and not use the pedal what I would like you to hear live be the 1955 version and we will play the first couple piece of it Glenn Gould 1955 music how about that applause so let I tell you a little bit how this be do first of all let I get you to the end step this be we have a fairly complex process that you know software and musician and so on but when we be all do we know that the ear be the final arbiter we can play the original in one ear and a new recording in the other so I be go to do this for you right now what you just hear and in the right speaker be go to be the original recording and the left speaker be go to be the new recording actually of a instrument just like that one and I be go to play they together at the same time music that be the original unclear that be the two together music before jurassic park there be no science for how skin hang off of muscle right so in the video world we have be able to invent in we lifetime natural behavior and this be kind of another example of put a science behind natural behavior and then you hear the original ultimately I start with the experience and the experience be I want to be in the room and hear the musician lot of you can afford to buy one of this but if not there be now high definition surround sound and I get to tell you if you have not hear high definition surround go down to you audio dealer you audiophile dealer it be so involve compare to regular stereo but if you do not have that maybe you can listen on you headphone and so on the same disk we have five recording Sony have five recording and you could listen in headphone with this thing call binaural recording and it be a dummy head that sit in front of the instrument and it be get microphone where the ear be and when you put on headphone and you listen to this you be inside of Glenn Gould body and it be a chuckle until you know the musician who be musician who play the piano listen to this say I can not believe it it be just what it be like to play the piano except now you be inside Glenn Gould body play the piano and it feel like you finger be make the decision and move through the whole process it be a game changer here be now something we know in spectacular quality the whole process be very sensitive to temperature and humidity what you hear today be not perfect it be a amalgam of wood and cast iron and feel and steel string and all this and they be all amazingly sensitive to temperature and humidity so when you go into the recording session you get to stop after every piece and rebuild the piano if you need to there be the whole action there sit kind of on the side and the dummy head and we recording engineer stand around while we rebuild the piano without put date next to this thing step by step music will be turn into datum like every field that be occur in the past 35 or 40 year Audio have come very late to this game I be not talk about digitize and bit and re master I be talk about turn it into the datum that it be make from which be how it be perform and audio come very late because we ear be so hard to fool they be high resolution and they be wired straight to we emotion and you can not trick they very easily you eye be pretty happy with some color and movement you know all right there be this episode of Star Trek laughter I get it it be all just lay in for I yesterday there the episode of Star Trek for I be James Daly play Methuselah remember this one and at some point he be dance with he and I will not ruin the episode for you from 1967 right do you know where I be go and Nimoy I be sorry Spock sit down at the piano and he start play this Brahms waltz and they all dance to it and then Spock turn round he go James I know all of the Brahms waltz and I do not believe this be one of they in the category that be where I be at I want to hear the waltz Brahms do not write I want to hear the piece that Horowitz do not play but I believe we be on a path now when we get to datum that we can distill style and template and formula and all this kind of thing again that you have see happen in the computer graphic world it be now come in this world the transition will be this one it say right now we think music be note and how they be play and I believe this be come because what you have just hear be a computer play datum no Glenn Gould in the room but yet it be human and I believe you will get to the next step the real dream of listener every time you listen to a recording today every time you take out you ipod and whatever every time you listen to it it be the same thing it be freeze would not it be cool if every time you listen it could be different this morning you be sad you want to hear you song the same song play sad than you do yesterday you want to hear it play by different musician you want to hear it in different room and whatever we have see all this star Treks and they be all holodeck episode as well every time I listen to that I get goose bump it be so amazing it be so exciting every time I listen to that record it be like oh my God I can not believe I be in the same room I can not believe this be happen it be a way well experience than whatever you be use to listen to in whatever form and lastly I will wrap up with one minute of art Tatum so I have really overshoot my budget here we make a new recording of he play in the Shrine Auditorium in September it be a concert he record in the Shrine Auditorium in 1949 and I have get to tell you we have this lab where we build and measure everything back in Raleigh North Carolina and we fly out to Los Angeles and as the president of the company I do not feel real comfortable about where we be that be a real uncomfortable feeling when all the equipment come out and a whole Sony team and person be go to be sit there in the audience and we put the piano on the sweet spot of the stage in the Shrine which have not change since 1949 still seat 6 000 person and on the sweet spot on the stage Tatum start play and every note every beat every slur every accent every pedal be perfect because he play it for that room on that day and we capture all that datum all over again and I want you to hear that right now and fortunately it be right in here this be a encore he use to do it be one minute long it be a Irish jig and I want you to hear he humor music applause and that be just what the live audience do applause so thank you very much Michael thank you for the opportunity
