I be go to talk to you about some stuff that be in this book of mine that I hope will resonate with other thing you have already hear and I will try to make some connection myself in case you miss they but I want to start with what I call the official dogma the official dogma of what the official dogma of all western industrial society and the official dogma run like this if we be interested in maximize the welfare of we citizen the way to do that be to maximize individual freedom the reason for this be both that freedom be in and of itself good valuable worthwhile essential to be human and because if person have freedom then each of we can act on we own to do the thing that will maximize we welfare and no one have to decide on we behalf the way to maximize freedom be to maximize choice the more choice person have the more freedom they have and the more freedom they have the more welfare they have this I think be so deeply embed in the water supply that it would not occur to anyone to question it and it be also deeply embed in we life I will give you some example of what modern progress have make possible for we this be my supermarket not such a big one I want to say just a word about salad dress 175 salad dressing in my supermarket if you do not count the 10 extra virgin olive oils and 12 balsamic vinegar you could buy to make a very large number of you own salad dressing in the off chance that none of the 175 the store have on offer suit you so this be what the supermarket be like and then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system speaker cd player tape player tuner amplifier and in this one single consumer electronics store there be that many stereo system we can construct six and a half million different stereo system out of the component that be on offer in one store you have get to admit that be a lot of choice in other domain the world of communication there be a time when I be a boy when you could get any kind of telephone service you want as long as it come from Ma Bell you rent you phone you do not buy it one consequence of that by the way be that the phone never break and that day be go we now have a almost unlimited variety of phone especially in the world of cell phone this be cell phone of the future my favorite be the middle one the mp3 player nose hair trimmer and cr I br l e torch laughter and if by some chance you have not see that in you store yet you can rest assure that one day soon you will and what this do be it lead person to walk into they store ask this question and do you know what the answer to this question now be the answer be no it be not possible to buy a cell phone that do not do too much so in other aspect of life that be much more significant than buy thing the same explosion of choice be true health care it be no long the case in the United States that you go to the doctor and the doctor tell you what to do instead you go to the doctor and the doctor tell you well we could do a or we could do b a have this benefit and this risk b have this benefit and this risk what do you want to do and you say Doc what should I do and the doc say a have this benefit and risk and b have this benefit and risk what do you want to do and you say if you be I Doc what would you do and the doc say but I be not you and the result be we call it patient autonomy which make it sound like a good thing but it really be a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision make from somebody who know something namely the doctor to somebody who know nothing and be almost certainly sick and thus not in the good shape to be make decision namely the patient there be enormous marketing of prescription drug to person like you and I which if you think about it make no sense at all since we can not buy they why do they market to we if we can not buy they the answer be that they expect we to call we doctor the next morning and ask for we prescription to be change something as dramatic as we identity have now become a matter of choice as this slide be mean to indicate we do not inherit a identity we get to invent it and we get to be invent ourselves as often as we like and that mean that every day when you wake up in the morning you have to decide what kind of person you want to be with respect to marriage and family there be a time when the default assumption that almost everyone have be that you get marry as soon as you could and then you start have kid as soon as you could the only real choice be who not when and not what you do after nowadays everything be very much up for grab I teach wonderfully intelligent student and I assign 20 percent less work than I use to and it be not because they be less smart and it be not because they be less diligent it be because they be preoccupy ask themselves should I get married or not should I get marry now should I get married later should I have kid first or a career first all of this be consume question and they be go to answer this question whether or not it mean not do all the work I assign and not get a good grade in my course and indeed they should this be important question to answer work we be bless as Carl be point out with the technology that enable we to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet except the Randolph Hotel laughter applause there be one corner by the way that I be not go to tell anybody about where the wifi actually work I be not tell you about it because I want to use it so what this mean this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work be that we have to make a decision again and again and again about whether we should or should not be work we can go to watch we kid play soccer and we have we cell phone on one hip and we blackberry on we other hip and we laptop presumably on we lap and even if they be all shut off every minute that we be watch we kid mutilate a soccer game we be also ask ourselves should I answer this cell phone call should I respond to this email should I draft this letter and even if the answer to the question be no it be certainly go to make the experience of you kid soccer game very different than it would have be so everywhere we look big thing and small thing material thing and lifestyle thing life be a matter of choice and the world we use to live in look like this well actually they be write in stone that be to say there be some choice but not everything be a matter of choice and the world we now live in look like this the ten commandment DYI Kit and the question be be this good news or bad news and the answer be yes laughter we all know what be good about it so I be go to talk about what be bad about it all of this choice have two effect two negative effect on person one effect paradoxically be that it produce paralysis rather than liberation with so many option to choose from person find it very difficult to choose at all I will give you one very dramatic example of this a study that be do of investment in voluntary retirement plan a colleague of mine get access to investment record from Vanguard the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employee and about 2 000 different workplace and what she find be that for every 10 mutual fund the employer offer rate of participation go down two percent you offer 50 fund 10 percent few employee participate than if you only offer five why because with 50 fund to choose from it be so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you will just put it off until tomorrow and then tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and of course tomorrow never come understand that not only do this mean that person be go to have to eat dog food when they retire because they do not have enough money put away it also mean that make the decision be so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer by not participate they be pass up as much as 5 000 dollar a year from the employer who would happily match they contribution so paralysis be a consequence of have too many choice and I think it make the world look like this and lastly for all eternity French bleu cheese or ranch laughter you really want to get the decision right if it be for all eternity right you do not want to pick the wrong mutual fund or the wrong salad dress so that be one effect the second effect be that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we have few option to choose from and there be several reason for this one of they be that with a lot of different salad dress to choose from if you buy one and it be not perfect and what salad dressing be it be easy to imagine you could have make a different choice that would have be good and what happen be this imagine alternative induce you to regret the decision you make and this regret subtract from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you make even if it be a good decision the more option there be the easy it be to regret anything at all that be disappointing about the option that you choose second what economist call opportunity cost Dan Gilbert make a big point this morning of talk about how much the way in which we value thing depend on what we compare they to well when there be lot of alternative to consider it be easy to imagine the attractive feature of alternative that you reject that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you have choose here be a example I can not stop think about that other available parking space on W 85th street sorry if you be not New Yorkers here be what you be suppose to be think here be this couple on the Hamptons very expensive real estate gorgeous beach beautiful day they have it all to themselves what could be good well damn it this guy be think it be August everybody in my Manhattan neighborhood be away I could be parking right in front of my building and he spend two week nag by the idea that he be miss the opportunity day after day to have a great parking space opportunity cost subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose even when what we choose be terrific and the more option there be to consider the more attractive feature of this option be go to be reflect by we as opportunity cost here be another example laughter now this cartoon make a lot of point it make point about live in the moment as well and probably about do thing slowly but one point it make be that whenever you be choose one thing you be choose not to do other thing that may have lot of attractive feature and it be go to make what you be do less attractive third escalation of expectation this hit I when I go to replace my jeans I wear jeans almost all the time there be a time when jeans come in one flavor and you buy they and they fit like crap they be incredibly uncomfortable if you wear they and wash they enough time they start to feel ok I go to replace my jeans after year of wear this old one and I say I want a pair of jeans here be my size and the shopkeeper say do you want slim fit easy fit relaxed fit you want button fly or zipper fly you want stonewashed or acid wash do you want they distressed you want boot cut tapered blah blah on and on he go my jaw drop and after I recover I say I want the kind that use to be the only kind laughter he have no idea what that be laughter so I spend a hour try on all this damn jeans and I walk out of the store truth with the good fitting jeans I have ever have I do good all this choice make it possible for I to do good but I feel bad why I write a whole book to try to explain this to myself the reason laughter the reason I feel bad be that with all of this option available my expectation about how good a pair of jeans should be go up I have very low no particular expectation when they only come in one flavor when they come in 100 flavor damn it one of they should have be perfect and what I get be good but it be not perfect and so I compare what I get to what I expect and what I get be disappointing in comparison to what I expect add option to person life can not help but increase the expectation person have about how good that option will be and what that be go to produce be less satisfaction with result even when they be good result nobody in the world of marketing know this it all look so great I can not wait to be disappoint because if they do you would not all know what this be about the truth be more like this everything be good back when everything be bad the reason that everything be good back when everything be bad be that when everything be bad it be actually possible for person to have experience that be a pleasant surprise nowadays the world we live in we affluent industrialized citizen with perfection the expectation the good you can ever hope for be that stuff be as good as you expect it to be you will never be pleasantly surprised because you expectation my expectation have go through the roof the secret to happiness this be what you all come for the secret to happiness be low expectation laughter you will do applause laughter I want to say just a little autobiographical moment that I actually be marry to a wife and she be really quite wonderful I could not have do good I do not settle but settle be not always such a bad thing finally one consequence of buy a bad fitting pair of jeans when there be only one kind to buy be that when you be dissatisfied and you ask why who be responsible the answer be clear the world be responsible what could you do when there be hundred of different style of jeans available and you buy one that be disappointing and you ask why who be responsible it be equally clear that the answer to the question be you you could have do good with a hundred different kind of jeans on display there be no excuse for failure and so when person make decision and even though the result of the decision be good they feel disappointed about they they blame themselves clinical depression have explode in the industrial world in the last generation I believe a significant not the only but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression and also suicide be that person have experience that be disappointing because they standard be so high and then when they have to explain this experience to themselves they think they be at fault and so the net result be that we do good in general objectively and we feel bad so let I remind you this be the official dogma the one that we all take to be true and it be all false it be not true there be no question that some choice be good than none but it do not follow from that that more choice be good than some choice there be some magical amount I do not know what it be I be pretty confident that we have long since pass the point where option improve we welfare now as a policy matter I be almost do as a policy matter the thing to think about be this what enable all of this choice in industrial society be material affluence there be lot of place in the world and we have hear about several of they where they problem be not that they have too much choice they problem be that they have too little so the stuff I be talk about be the peculiar problem of modern affluent western society and what be so frustrating and infuriating be this Steve Levitt talk to you yesterday about how this expensive and difficult to install child seat do not help it be a waste of money what I be tell you be that this expensive complicated choice it be not simply that they do not help they actually hurt they actually make we bad off if some of what enable person in we society to make all of the choice we make be shift to society in which person have too few option not only would that person life be improve but ours would be improve also which be what economist call a pareto improve move income redistribution will make everyone well off not just poor person because of how all this excess choice plague we so to conclude you can be anything you want to be no limit you be suppose to read this cartoon and be a sophisticated person say ah what do this fish know you know nothing be possible in this fishbowl impoverished imagination a myopic view of the world and that be the way I read it at first the more I think about it however the more I come to the view that this fish know something because the truth of the matter be that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything be possible you do not have freedom you have paralysis if you shatter this fishbowl so that everything be possible you decrease satisfaction you increase paralysis and you decrease satisfaction everybody need a fishbowl this one be almost certainly too limited perhaps even for the fish certainly for we but the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl be a recipe for misery and I suspect disaster thank you very much applause
