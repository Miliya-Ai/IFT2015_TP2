I be here today represent a team of artist and technologist and filmmaker that work together on a remarkable film project for the last four year and along the way they create a breakthrough in computer visualization so I want to show you a clip of the film now hopefully it will not stutter and if we do we job well you will not know that we be even involve Voice Video I do not know how it be possible but you seem to have more hair Brad Pitt what if I tell you that I be not get old but I be get young than everybody else I be bear with some form of disease Voice what kind of disease bp I be bear old man I be sorry bp no need to be there be nothing wrong with old age girl be you sick bp I hear momma and tizzy whisper and they say I be go to die soon but maybe not Girl you be different than anybody I have ever meet BB there be many change some you could see some you could not hair start grow in all sort of place along with other thing I feel pretty good consider Ed Ulbrich that be a clip from the curious case of Benjamin Button many of you maybe you have see it or you have hear of the story but what you might not know be that for nearly the first hour of the film the main character Benjamin Button who be play by Brad Pitt be completely computer generate from the neck up now there be no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of Brad superimpose over another actor body we have create a completely digital human head so I would like to start with a little bit of history on the project this be base on a f Scott Fitzgerald short story it be about a man who be bear old and live he life in reverse now this movie have float around Hollywood for well over half a century and we first get involve with the project in the early 90 with Ron Howard as the director we take a lot of meeting and we seriously consider it but at the time we have to throw in the towel it be deem impossible it be beyond the technology of the day to depict a man age backwards the human form in particular the human head have be consider the Holy Grail of we industry the project come back to we about a decade later and this time with a director name David Fincher now Fincher be a interesting guy David be fearless of technology and he be absolutely tenacious and David will not take no and David believe like we do in the visual effect industry that anything be possible as long as you have enough time resource and of course money and so David have a interesting take on the film and he throw a challenge at we he want the main character of the film to be play from the cradle to the grave by one actor it happen to be this guy we go through a process of elimination and a process of discovery with David and we rule out of course swap actor that be one idea that we would have different actor and we would hand off from actor to actor we even rule out the idea of use makeup we realize that prosthetic makeup just would not hold up particularly in close up and makeup be a additive process you have to build the face up and David want to carve deeply into Brad face to bring the aging to this character he need to be a very sympathetic character so we decide to cast a series of little person that would play the different body of Benjamin at the different increment of he life and that we would in fact create a computer generate version of Brad head age to appear as Benjamin and attach that to the body of the real actor sound great of course this be the Holy Grail of we industry and the fact that this guy be a global icon do not help either because I be sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store you know we see he face constantly so there really be no tolerable margin of error there be two studio involve Warner Brothers and Paramount and they both believe this would make a amazing film of course but it be a very high risk proposition there be lot of money and reputation at stake but we believe that we have a very solid methodology that might work but despite we verbal assurance they want some proof and so in 2004 they commission we to do a screen test of Benjamin and we do it in about five week but we use lot of cheat and shortcut we basically put something together to get through the meeting I will roll that for you now this be the first test for Benjamin Button and in here you can see that be a computer generate head pretty good attach to the body of a actor and it work and it give the studio great relief after many year of start and stop on this project and make that tough decision they finally decide to greenlight the movie and I can remember actually when I get the phone call to congratulate we to say the movie be a go I actually throw up laughter you know this be some tough stuff so we start to have early team meeting and we get everybody together and it be really more like therapy in the beginning convince each other and reassuring each other that we could actually undertake this we have to hold up a hour of a movie with a character and it be not a special effect film it have to be a man we really feel like we be in a kind of a 12 step program and of course the first step be admit you have get a problem laughter so we have a big problem we do not know how we be go to do this but we do know one thing be from the visual effect industry we with David believe that we now have enough time enough resource and God we hope we have enough money and we have enough passion to will the process and technology into existence so when you be face with something like that of course you have get to break it down you take the big problem and you break it down into small piece and you start to attack that so we have three main area that we have to focus on we need to make Brad look a lot old need to age he 45 year or so and we also need to make sure that we could take Brad idiosyncrasy he little tic the little subtlety that make he who he be and have that translate through we process so that it appear in Benjamin on the screen and we also need to create a character that could hold up under really all condition he need to be able to walk in broad daylight at nighttime under candlelight he have to hold a extreme close up he have to deliver dialogue he have to be able to run he have to be able to sweat he have to be able to take a bath to cry he even have to throw up not all at the same time but he have to you know do all of that thing and the work have to hold up for almost the first hour of the movie we do about 325 shot so we need a system that would allow Benjamin to do everything a human being can do and we realize that there be a giant chasm between the state of the art of technology in 2004 and where we need it to be so we focus on motion capture I be sure many of you have see motion capture the state of the art at the time be something call marker base motion capture I will give you a example here it be basically the idea of you wear a leotard and they put some reflective marker on you body and instead of use camera there be infrared sensor around a volume and that infrared sensor track the three dimensional position of that marker in real time and then animator can take the datum of the motion of that marker and apply they to a computer generate character you can see the computer character on the right be have the same complex motion as the dancer but we also look at number of other film at the time that be use facial marker tracking and that be the idea of put marker on the human face and do the same process and as you can see it give you a pretty crappy performance that be not terribly compelling and what we realize be that what we need be the information that be go on between the marker we need the subtlety of the skin we need to see skin move over muscle move over bone we need crease and dimple and wrinkle and all of that thing we first revelation be to completely abort and walk away from the technology of the day the status quo the state of the art so we abort use motion capture and we be now well out of we comfort zone and in uncharted territory so we be leave with this idea that we end up call technology stew we start to look out in other field the idea be that we be go to find nugget or gem of technology that come from other industry like medical imaging the video game space and re appropriate they and we have to create kind of a sauce and the sauce be code in software that we have write to allow this disparate piece of technology to come together and work as one initially we come across some remarkable research do by a gentleman name Dr Paul Ekman in the early 70 he believe that he could in fact catalog the human face and he come up with this idea of facial action code system or fac he believe that there be 70 basic pose or shape of the human face and that that basic pose or shape of the face can be combine to create infinite possibility of everything the human face be capable of do and of course this transcend age race culture gender so this become the foundation of we research as we go forward and then we come across some remarkable technology call Contour and here you can see a subject have phosphorus makeup stipple on she face and now what we be look at be really create a surface capture as oppose to a marker capture the subject stand in front of a computer array of camera and that camera can frame by frame reconstruct the geometry of exactly what the subject do at the moment so effectively you get 3d datum in real time of the subject and if you look in a comparison on the left we see what volumetric datum give we and on the right you see what marker give we so clearly we be in a substantially good place for this but this be the early day of this technology and it be not really prove yet we measure complexity and fidelity of datum in term of polygonal count and so on the left we be see 100 000 polygon we could go up into the million of polygon it seem to be infinite this be when we have we aha this be the breakthrough this be when we be like ok we be go to be ok this be actually go to work and the aha be what if we could take Brad Pitt and we could put Brad in this device and use this contour process and we could stipple on this phosphorescent makeup and put he under the black light and we could in fact scan he in real time perform Ekman fac pose right so effectively we end up with a 3d database of everything Brad Pitt face be capable of do laughter from there we actually carve up that face into small piece and component of he face so we end up with literally thousand and thousand and thousand of shape a complete database of all possibility that he face be capable of do now that be great except we have he at age 44 we need to put another 40 year on he at this point we bring in Rick Baker and Rick be one of the great makeup and special effect guru of we industry and we also bring in a gentleman name Kazu Tsuji and Kazu Tsuji be one of the great photorealist sculptor of we time and we commission they to make a maquette or a bust of Benjamin so in the spirit of the great unveiling I have to do this I have to unveil something so this be Ben 80 we create three of this there be Ben 80 there be Ben 70 there be Ben 60 and this really become the template for move forward now this be make from a life cast of Brad so in fact anatomically it be correct the eye the jaw the tooth everything be in perfect alignment with what the real guy have we have this maquette scan into the computer at very high resolution enormous polygonal count and so now we have three age increment of Benjamin in the computer but we need to get a database of he do more than that we go through this process then call retarget this be Brad do one of the Ekman fac pose and here be the result datum that come from that the model that come from that retargeting be the process of transpose that datum onto another model and because the life cast or the bust the maquette of Benjamin be make from Brad we could transpose the datum of Brad at 44 onto Brad at 87 so now we have a 3d database of everything Brad Pitt face can do at age 87 in he 70 and in he 60 next we have to go into the shooting process so while all that be go on we be down in New Orleans and location around the world and we shoot we body actor and we shoot they wear blue hood so this be the gentleman who play Benjamin and the blue hood help we with two thing one we could easily erase they head and we also put track marker on they head so we could recreate the camera motion and the lens optics from the set but now we need to get Brad performance to drive we virtual Benjamin and so we edit the footage that be shoot on location with the rest of the cast and the body actor and about six month later we bring Brad onto a sound stage in Los Angeles and he watch on the screen he job then be to become Benjamin and so we loop the scene he watch again and again we encourage he to improvise and he take Benjamin into interesting and unusual place that we do not think he be go to go we shoot he with four hd camera so we have get multiple view of he and then David would choose the take of Brad be Benjamin that he think good match the footage with the rest of the cast from there we go into a process call image analysis and so here you can see again the choose take and you be see now that datum be transpose on to Ben 87 and so what be interesting about this be we use something call image analysis which be take timing from different component of Benjamin face and so we could choose say he leave eyebrow and the software would tell we that well in frame 14 the left eyebrow begin to move from here to here and it conclude move in frame 32 and so we could choose number of position on the face to pull that datum from and then the sauce I talk about with we technology stew that secret sauce be effectively software that allow we to match the performance footage of Brad in live action with we database of aged Benjamin the fac shape that we have on a frame by frame basis we could actually reconstruct a 3d head that exactly match the performance of Brad so this be how the finished shot appear in the film and here you can see the body actor and then this be what we call the dead head no reference to Jerry Garcia and then here be the reconstruct performance now with the timing of the performance and then again the final shot it be a long process applause the next section here I be go to just blast through this because we could do a whole tedtalk on the next several slide we have to create a lighting system so really a big part of we process be create a lighting environment for every single location that Benjamin have to appear so that we could put Ben head into any scene and it would exactly match the lighting that be on the other actor in the real world we also have to create a eye system we find the old adage you know the eye be the window to the soul absolutely true so the key here be to keep everybody look in Ben eye and if you could feel the warmth and feel the humanity and feel he intent come through the eye then we would succeed so we have one person focus on the eye system for almost two full year we also have to create a mouth system we work from dental mold of Brad we have to age the tooth over time we also have to create a articulate tongue that allow he to enunciate he word there be a whole system write in software to articulate the tongue we have one person devoted to the tongue for about nine month he be very popular skin displacement another big deal the skin have to be absolutely accurate he be also in a old age home he be in a nursing home around other old person so he have to look exactly the same as the other so lot of work on skin deformation you can see in some of this case it work in some case it look bad this be a very very very early test in we process so effectively we create a digital puppet that Brad Pitt could operate with he own face there be no animator necessary to come in and interpret behavior or enhance he performance there be something that we encounter though that we end up call the digital Botox effect so as thing go through this process Fincher would always say it sandblast the edge off of the performance and thing we process and the technology could not do be they could not understand intent the intent of the actor so it see a smile as a smile it do not recognize a ironic smile or a happy smile or a frustrated smile so it do take human to kind of push it one way or another but we end up call the entire process and all the technology emotion capture as oppose to just motion capture take another look Brad Pitt well I hear momma and tizzy whisper and they say I be go to die soon but maybe not EU that be how to create a digital human in 18 minute applause a couple of quick factoid it really take 155 person over two year and we do not even talk about 60 hairstyle and a all digital haircut but that be Benjamin thank you
