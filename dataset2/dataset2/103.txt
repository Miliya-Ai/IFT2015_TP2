there be a lot of exciting thing happen in the design world and at IDEO this past year and I be pleased to get a chance to share some of that with you I do not attend the first TED back in 1984 but I have be to a lot of they since that time I think it would kind of be interesting to think back to that time when Richard get the whole thing start thank you very much Richard it be be a big enjoyable part of my life come here and so think back I be think that of we in Silicon Valley be really focus on product or object certainly technological object and so it be great fun in that day and some of that of you who be in the audience be my client we have come in with some prototype underneath a black cloth and we would put it on the conference table and we would pull off the black cloth and everybody would ooh and ah that be a really good time and so we will continue to focus on product as we always have and if you be here last year I probably wrestle you to the floor and try to show you my new eyemodule 2 which be a camera that plug into the Handspring and I take a lot of picture last year very few person know what I be up to but I take a lot of picture this year maybe you could show the slide this year we be carry this Treo which we have a lot to do with and help Handspring design it also though we design it a few year ago it be just become ubiquitous in the last year or so this Heartstream defibrillator which be save life maybe you have see they in the airport they seem to be everywhere now lot of life be be save by that and we be just about to announce the Zinio Reader product that I believe will make magazine even more enjoyable to read so we really will continue to focus on product but something happen in the last 18 year since Richard start TED and that be that person like we I know person in other place have catch onto this for a long time but for we we have really just start we have kind of climb Maslow hierarchy a little bit and so we be now focus more and more on human center design human centeredness in a approach to design that really involve design behavior and personality into product and I think you be start to see that and it be make we job even more enjoyable interestingly enough we use to primarily build 3 d model you know you have see some today and 3 d rendering then we would go and we would show that as communicate we idea but firm like ours be have to move to a point where we get that object that we be design and get they in motion show how they will be use and so in order to do that we have be form internal video production group in order to make this kind of experience prototype that show just what we mean about the man machine relationship and it be a much good way to see it be kind of like architect who show person in they house as oppose to they be empty so I think that I would show you a few video to show off this new broad definition of design in product and service and environment I have a few of they they be no more than a minute or a minute and a half apiece but I think you might be interested in see some of we work over the last year and how it respond in video so Prada New York we be ask by Rem Koolhaas and OMA to help we conceive the technology that be in they retail store in New York he want a new kind of store a new one a store that have a cultural role as well as a retail one and that mean actually design custom technology as oppose to just buy thing off the shelf and put they to use so there be lot of thing everything have rf tag there be rf tag on the user on the card there be the staff device that be all around the store you pick they up and once you see something that you be interested in the staff person can scan they in and then they can be show on any screen throughout the store you can look at color and size and how it appear on the runway or whatever and so then the object the merchandise that you be interested in can be scan it be take into the dressing room and in the dressing room there be scanner so that we know exactly what clothing you have in the dressing room we can put that up on a touch screen and you can play with that and get more information about the clothing that you be interested in as you be try it on it be be use a lot of place but I particularly like the use here of liquid crystal display in the change room the last time I go to see this store there be a huge buzz about person stand outside and wonder be I go to actually get to see the person change clothes here but if you push the button of course the whole wall go dark so you can try to get approval or not for whatever you be wear and then one of my favorite feature of the technology be the magic mirror where you put on the clothes there be a big display in the mirror and you can turn around but there be a three second delay so you can see what you look like from the back or all the way around as you look applause about a year and a half ago we be ask to design a installation in the museum this be a new wing of the Science Museum in London and it be primarily about digital and biomedical issue and a group at itch which be now part of IDEO design this interactive wall that be about four story tall I do not know if anybody see this it be pretty spectacular in the room anyway it be base on the London subway system and so you can see that the goal be to bring some of the feedback that the person who have go to the museum be give and get it up on the wall so everybody could see just for everybody to see so you enter you information then like the London tube system the little train go around with what you be think about and then when you get to a station it be expand so that you can actually read it then when you exit the IMAX theatre on the fourth floor mostly teenager come out of there there be this big open space that have this table in it that have interactive game which be quite fun also design by Durrell Bishop and Andrew Hirniak of Itch and the topic include thing that the museum be about male fertility choose the sex of you baby or what a driverless car might be like there be lot of room so person can come up and understand what it be before they get involved and also it be not show in the video but this be very beautiful they go to the top of the wall and when they reach all the way to the top after they have bounce around they disperse into bit and go off into the atmosphere the next video be not do by we this be CBS Sunday morning that air about two week ago Scott Adams run into we and ask we if we would not help to design the ultimate cubicle for Dilbert which sound like a fun thing and so we could not pass it up he be always be interested in technology in the future video Scott Adams I realize that at some point I might be the world expert on what be wrong with cubicle so we think well would not it be fun to get together with some of the smart design guy in the world and try to figure out if we could make the cubicle well Narrator though they work in a wide open office space spectacularly set under San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge the team build they own little cubicle to fully experience the problem woman a one way mirror I can look out you can look at yourself Narrator they take picture Woman you feel so trap when someone kind of lean over and you be sort of hold captive there for a minute SA so far it be chaos but a lot of person be do stuff so that be good we will see what happen Narrator the first group build a cubicle in which the wall be screen for the computer and for family photo in the second group scenario the wall be alive and actually give Dilbert a group hug laughter behind the humor be the idea of make the cubicle more human David Kelley so here be the final thing complete with orange lighting that follow the sun across that follow the track of the sun across the sky so you feel that in you cubicle and my favorite feature which be a flower in a vase that wilt when you leave in disappointment and then when you come back it come up to greet you happy to see you SA the storage be build right into the wall DK you know it have homey touch like a build in fish tank in the wall or something to be aggressive with to release tension SA Customizable for the boss of you choice DK and of course a hammock for you afternoon nap that stretch across you cubicle SA Life would be sweet in a cubicle like this DK this next project we be ask to design a pavilion to celebrate the recycling of the water on the Millennium Dome in London the dome have a incredible amount of water that wash off of it as well as wastewater so this building actually celebrate the water as it come out of the recycling plant and go into the reed bed so that it can be filter for the final time the pavilion design goal be to be kind of quiet and peaceful in contrast to if you go inside the dome where it be kind of wild and crazy and everybody be learn all kind of thing or fool around or whatever they be do but it be intend to be quite quiet and then you would wander around and gather information in a straightforward fashion about the recycling process and what be be do and how they be go to reuse the water once it come through the plant and then if you see the panel actually rotate so you can get the information on the front side but as they rotate you can see the actual recycling plant behind with all the machine as they actually process the water you can see there be the plant this be all very low budget video like quick prototype and we be announce a new product here tonight which be the first time this have ever be show in public it be call Spyfish and it be a company call h2eye start by Nigel Jagger in London and it be a company that be try to bring the experience many person have boat or enjoy be on boat but a very small percentage of person actually have the capability or the interest in go under the water and actually see what be there and enjoy what scuba diver do this product it have two camera you throw it over the side of you boat and you basically scuba dive without get wet for we there be the object for we it be two project one to design the interface so that the interface do not get in you way you could have that kind of immersive experience of be underwater of feel like you be underwater see what be go on and the other one be to design the object and make sure that it be a consumer product and not a research tool and so we spend a lot of time this have be go on for about seven or eight year this project and we be just ready to start build they Narrator the Spyfish be a revolutionary subaquatic video camera it can dive to 500 foot to where sunlight do not penetrate and be equip with powerful light it become you eye and ear as you venture into the deep the battery power Spyfish send the live video feed through a slender cable DK this slender cable be a huge technological advancement and it allow the whole thing to be the size that it be Narrator and this central box connect the whole system together maneuver the Spyfish be simple with the wireless remote control you watch the video with superimpose graphic that indicate you depth and compass head the fluid graphic and ambient sound combine to help you completely lose yourself underwater applause DK and the last thing I will talk about be approtec which be a project that I be very excited about ApproTEC be a company start by Dr Martin Fisher who be a good friend of mine he be a ph d from Stanford he find himself in Kenya on a Fulbright and he have a very interesting insight which be that he say there must be entrepreneur in Kenya there must be entrepreneur everywhere and he notice that for wedding and funeral there they could find enough money to put something together so he decide to start manufacture product in Kenya with Kenyan manufacturer design by person like we but take there and to this date he be be go for only a few year he be start 19 000 company he be make 30 000 new job and just the sale of the product this be a non profit the sale of this product be now 6 of the gdp of Kenya this be one guy do this this be a pretty spectacular thing so we be in the process of help they design deep well low cost manual pump in order for this person who have a quarter acre of land to be able to grow crop in the off season what they do now be they can grow crop in the rainy season but they can not grow they in the off season and so by do that the woman that you see in the first thing she be a school teacher always want to send she kid to college and she be go to be able to do it because of this thing so with seed squeezer and pump and hay baler and very straightforward thing that we be design my student be do this as class project and IDEO have donate they time to do this kind of work it be really amazing to see he success Martin we also be think about the experience of Richard and so laughter we design this hat because I know I would be the last one in the day and I need to deal with he so I just have one more thing to say laughter can you read it laughter well it be always kind of funny when he come up and hover you know you do not want to be rude to he and you do not want to feel guilty and so I think this would do it where I just sit here laughter applause so we see a lot of interesting thing be design today in this session and from all the different presenter and in my own practice from product to ApproTEC it be really exciting that we be take a more human center approach to design that we be include behavior and personality in the thing we do and I think this be great designer be more trusted and more integrate into the business strategy of company and I have to say for one I feel very lucky at the progress that design have make since the first TED thanks a lot
