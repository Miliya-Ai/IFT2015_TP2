good morning my name be David Rose I be a serial entrepreneur turn serial investor and by the use of pitch powerpoint to vc I have personally raise ten of million of dollar from vc through PowerPoint pitch and turn to the other side of the equation I have personally supervise the investment of ten of million of dollar into company who have pitch I with powerpoint presentation so I think it be safe to say I know a little bit about the process of pitch so the very first question you have get to figure out be what be the single most important thing that a VC be look for when you come to they pitch you new business idea there be obviously all kind of thing business model and financial and market and this and that overall of all the thing that you have to do what be the single most important thing the VC be go to be invest in somebody what audience person David Rose People you that be it you be the person therefore the entire purpose of a VC pitch be to convince they that you be the entrepreneur in whom they be go to invest they money and make a lot of money in return now how do you do this you can not just walk up and say hi I be a really good guy good girl and you should invest in I right so in the course of you VC pitch you have a very few minute most VC pitch angel pitch be about 15 minute most should be less than half a hour person attention span after 18 minute begin to drop off test have show so in that 18 or 10 or five minute you have to convey a whole bunch of different characteristic about 10 different characteristic while you be stand up there what be the single most important thing you have get to convey what Audience Integrity DR Boy oh boy oh boy that be a straight line look at that and I do not even prompt he right integrity the key thing I would much rather invest in take a chance on somebody who I know be straight than where there be any possible question of who be they look out for and what be go on so the most important thing be integrity what be the second most important thing let see if you can get this one audience self confidence DR Close enough passion right entrepreneur by definition be person who be leave something else start a new world create and put they lifeblood into this thing you have get to convey passion if you be not passionate why should anyone else be or put money into you company if you be not passionate about it Integrity passion the most important thing then there be a whole panoply of other thing you have get to wrap up in this package you be present to a VC experience you have get to be able to say hey you know I have do this before do this before be start a enterprise create value and take something from begin to end that be why vc love to fund serial entrepreneur even if you do not do it right the first time you have learn the lesson which put you in good stead the next time along with the experience of start a enterprise or run something do not have to be a business it can be a organization in a school a not for profit but experience in create a organization next knowledge if you tell I you be go to be the developer of the map of the human genome you good know what a human genome be I want you to have expertise I do not want somebody who say I have get a great idea in a business I know nothing about I do not know who the player be what the market be like you have get to know you market you area and you have to have the skill that it take to get a company go that skill include everything from technical skill if it be a technology business to marketing and sale and management and so on but you know not everybody have all this skill very few person have the full set of skill it take to run a company what else do you require well leadership you have get to be able to convince we that you either have develop a team that have all that factor in it or else you can and you have the charisma and the management style and the ability to get person to follow you lead to inspire they to motivate they to be part of you team have do all that what else do I want to know as a VC I want to know that you have commitment that you be go to be here to the end I want you to say or I want you to convey that you be go to die if you have to with you very last breath you fingernail scratch as they draw you out you will keep my money alive and make more from it I do not want someone who will cut and run at the first opportunity bad thing happen there be never be a venture fund company where bad thing do not happen so know that you be commit to the very end you have get to have vision to see where this be go I do not want another I too product I want somebody who can change the world out there but on top of that I need realism because while change the world be great it do not always happen and before you get to change the world bad thing be go to take place you have to deal with that and you have to have rational projection finally you be ask for my money not just because it be my money but because it be I you need to be coachable I need to know you have the ability to listen we have have a lot of experience person who be vc or angel invest in you have have experience and they would like to know that you want to hear that experience so how do you convey this 10 thing in 10 minute without say they you can not say I have get integrity invest in I you have get to do a whole pitch that convey this without convey it think about you pitch as a timeline it start off you walk in the door they know nothing whatsoever about you you can take they on a emotional all pitch all sale presentation be emotional at some level you can go up you can go down right and it go from begin to end you walk in the first thing you have get to do the overall arc of you presentation it be get to start like a rocket you have get maybe 10 second between 10 and 30 second depend on how long the pitch be to get they attention in my case I have invest I have get million of dollar from PowerPoint pitch I have invest million that should get you right there this can be a fact or something counterintuitive it can be a story or a experience but you have get to grab they emotional attention focus on you within that first few second and then from there you have get to take they on a very solid steady upward path right from begin to end everything have to reinforce this and you have get to get good and good and good rev up to the very end then you have get to boom knock they out of the park you want to get they to such a emotional high they be ready to write you a check throw money at you before you leave how do you do that First of all logical progression any time you go backwards any time you skip a step imagine walk up a staircase where some of the tread be miss or the height be different you stop you need to figure out a nice logical progression start with what the market be why be you go to do x y or z and then you have get to tell I how you be go to do it and what you be go to do and it be get to flow from begin to end you have get to let I know there be touchstone to tie in to the rest of the world out there for example reference company I have hear of or basic item in you business I want to know about thing that I can relate to validator or anything that tell I somebody else have approve this or there be outside validation it can be sale it can be you get a award for something it can be person have do it before it can be you beta test be go great whatever I want to know validation not just what you be tell I but that somebody or something else out there say this make sense and then I be look for the upside I need a believable upside that be two part it be get to be upside and believable the upside mean if you tell I that five year out you be make a million dollar a year that be not really upside tell I you will be make a billion dollar a year that be not believable so it be get to be both on the other hand be thing that take the emotional level down you have to recover from that for example anything that I know be not true we have no competition nobody make a widget like this Odds be I know somebody who be make a widget and the minute you tell I that I discount half of what you be say from then on anything I do not understand where I have to make the leap myself in my own head will stop the flow of the presentation so you have get to take I through like a sixth grader dub dub dub but without patronize I and it be a very tricky path but if you can do it it work really well anything that be inconsistent within you concept if you tell I sale of x y or z be 10 million dollar five slide later they be five million dollar one may have be gross sale one may have be net sale but I want to know that all the number make sense together and then finally anything that be a error or a typo or a stupid mistake or a line that be in the wrong place that show I that if you can not do a presentation how can you run a company so this all feed in together the good way to do this be to look at we betters person who have do this before let look at the most successful technology executive in the business and see how a presentation go Bill Gates PowerPoint presentation over here here be Gates do a thing for Windows be this how to do a powerpoint presentation what do you think no who do you think we should look at as we role model oh be not that funny there be another great one over here ok Steve Jobs you want absolute this be the Zen of presentation right here he be one little guy black jeans and stuff on a totally empty stage what be you focus on you be focus on he this be Steve Jobs so be this wonderful long bullet point whole list of thing good no they be not the long bullet point be bad what be good short short bullet point but you know what even good than short bullet point be no bullet point just give I the headline and you know what how many bullet point do Steve Jobs use basically none what do you do good of all image just a simple image I look at the image a picture worth a thousand word you look at the image and you have get the whole thing then you come back to I you be focus on I why I be such a great guy why you want to invest why this all make sense that say we only have a very short time so let run through the thing to include in you presentation First of all none of this big long title slide with blah blah I be present to so and so on x date I know the day I know who I be I do not need all that just give I you company logo I look at the logo and it tie it to my brain then I come back to you I be focus on you ok you give I you quick 15 second or 30 second intro grab my attention then you give I a quick business overview this be not a five minute pitch this be you know two sentence we build widget for the x y z market or we sell service to help do x you know whatever and that be like the picture on the outside of a jigsaw puzzle box that let I know the context it give I the armature for the whole thing you will be go through it let I put everything in relation to what you have tell I then you have get to walk I through show I who you management team be I want to know the size of the market why be this market worth get at I want to know you product that be very important now this be not a product pitch or sale pitch I do not want to know all the in and out just what the heck be it if it be a website show I a screenshot of you website do not do a live demo never do a live demo do a can demo or something that let I know why person be go to buy whatever it be now that I know what you be sell tell I how you make money on it for every x you sell you get y or service of z I want to know what the business model be on a per unit basis or for the actual product you be sell I want to know who you be sell to in term of customer and if you have any special relationship that will help you whether it be a distribution relationship or a produce partner again validation this help to say you be big than just one little thing over here but everybody have competition there be never be a company with no competition even if the competition be the old way of do something I want to know exactly what you competition be and that will help I judge how you fit into the whole operation I want to know how you be special I know what you competition do how be you go to prevent they from eat you lunch all this tie into the financial overview and you can not do a VC pitch without give I you financial I want to know a year or two back or as long as you have be in existence and I want to know four or five year forward five be a bit much probably four and I want to know how that business model on a product basis will translate into a company model how many widget will you sell you make x amount per widget I want to know what the driver be we will have 1 000 customer this year and 10 000 the next we revenue will do this and that that give I the whole picture for the next several year into which I be invest and I want to know how the money from I will help you get there you be go to open a offshore plant in China you be go to spend it all on sale and marketing you be go to go to Tahiti whatever but then come the ask where you tell I how much you want you be look for 5 million at what valuation two million 100 000 what be the money in so far who invest I hope you invest if you can not invest in you own thing why should I so I like to know if you have friend and family or angel investor or more vc before what be the capital structure up until this point finally have do all that you have now tell I the whole thing so now you bring it back to that conclusion this be that rocket go up hopefully everything have be positive and everything you say click it all make sense and I be think this be really great then you take I back to just you logo on the screen and I look at the logo ok good now I come back to you nothing else to look at right now you have get to wrap it up to give I the final boom the final pitch that be go to send I into space now in the process of do this how do you remember the sequence and do it you have notice I be not look at the screen right the screen be in front of I so I could not even see if I want to so how do I know what be go on well I have a laptop in front of I you be look at I and at this what be I look at you think that I be look at that no I be look actually at a special version of PowerPoint over here which show I the slide ahead and behind my note so I can see what be go on PowerPoint have this build into every copy of it that be ship if you use Apple Keynote it be get a even good version there be another program call Ovation you can get from Adobe that they buy last summer which help you run the timer and let you figure out what be go on so here be my wrap up to take you to the moon right I usually do a top 10 but we do not have time so David Top Five Presentation Tips Number five always use presenter mode or ovation or presenter tool it let you know exactly where you be go help you pace yourself give you a timer the whole bit number four always use remote control have you see I touch the computer no why not because I be use remote control always use remote control number three the handout you give be not you presentation if you follow my suggestion you will have a very spare Zen like presentation which be great to convey who you be and get person emotionally involved but not good as a handout you want a handout that give more information it have to stand without you Number two do not read you speech can you imagine read you should invest in my company it do not work and the number one presentation tip never ever look at the screen you be make a connection with you audience and you always want a one on one connection the screen should come up behind you and supplement what you be do instead of replace you and that be how to pitch to a VC
