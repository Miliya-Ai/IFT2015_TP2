the brilliant playwright Adrienne Kennedy write a volume call person who lead to my Plays and if I be to write a volume it would be call Artists who have lead my exhibition because my work in understanding art and in understanding culture have come by follow artist by look at what artist mean and what they do and who they be J J from Good Times applause significant to many person of course because of Dy no mite but perhaps more significant as the first really black artist on primetime tv Jean Michel Basquiat important to I because he be the first black artist in real time that show I the possibility of who and what I be about to enter into my overall project be about art specifically about black artist very generally about the way in which art can change the way we think about culture and ourselves my interest be in artist who understand and rewrite history who think about themselves within the narrative of the large world of art but who have create new place for we to see and understand I be show two artist here Glenn Ligon and Kara Walker two of many who really form for I the essential question that I want to bring as a curator to the world I be interested in the idea of why and how I could create a new story a new narrative in art history and a new narrative in the world and to do this I know that I have to see the way in which artist work understand the artist studio as a laboratory imagine then reinvent the museum as a think tank and look at the exhibition as the ultimate white paper ask question provide the space to look and to think about answer in 1994 when I be a curator at the Whitney Museum I make a exhibition call Black Male it look at the intersection of race and gender in contemporary American art it seek to express the way in which art could provide a space for dialogue complicate dialogue dialogue with many many point of entry and how the museum could be the space for this contest of idea this exhibition include over 20 artist of various age and race but all look at black masculinity from a very particular point of view what be significant about this exhibition be the way in which it engage I in my role as a curator as a catalyst for this dialogue one of the thing that happen very distinctly in the course of this exhibition be I be confront with the idea of how powerful image can be in person understanding of themselves and each other I be show you two work one on the right by Leon Golub one on the leave by Robert Colescott and in the course of the exhibition which be contentious controversial and ultimately for I life change in my sense of what art could be a woman come up to I on the gallery floor to express she concern about the nature of how powerful image could be and how we understand each other and she point to the work on the leave to tell I how problematic this image be as it relate for she to the idea of how black person have be represent and she point to the image on the right as a example to I of the kind of dignity that need to be portray to work against that image in the media she then assign this work racial identity basically say to I that the work on the right clearly be make by a black artist the work on the left clearly by a white artist when in effect that be the opposite case Bob Colescott African American artist Leon Golub a white artist the point of that for I be to say in that space in that moment that I really more than anything want to understand how image could work how image do work and how artist provide a space big than one that we could imagine in we day to day live to work through this image fast forward and I end up in Harlem home for many of black America very much the psychic heart of the black experience really the place where the Harlem Renaissance exist Harlem now sort of explain and think of itself in this part of the century look both backwards and forwards I always say Harlem be a interesting community because unlike many other place it think of itself in the past present and the future simultaneously no one speak of it just in the now it be always what it be and what it can be and in think about that then my second project the second question I ask be can a museum be a catalyst in a community can a museum house artist and allow they to be change agent as community rethink themselves this be Harlem actually on January 20th think about itself in a very wonderful way so I work now at the Studio Museum in Harlem think about exhibition there think about what it mean to discover art possibility now what do this mean to some of you in some case I know that many of you be involve in cross cultural dialogue you be involve in idea of creativity and innovation think about the place that artist can play in that that be the kind of incubation and advocacy that I work towards in work with young black artist think about artist not as content provider though they can be brilliant at that but again as real catalyst the Studio Museum be found in the late 60 and I bring this up because it be important to locate this practice in history to look at 1968 in the incredible historic moment that it be and think of the arc that have happen since then to think of the possibility that we be all privileged to stand in today and imagine that this museum that come out of a moment of great protest and one that be so much about examine the history and the legacy of important African American artist to the history of art in this country like Jacob Lawrence Norman Lewis Romare Bearden and then of course to bring we to today in 1975 Muhammad Ali give a lecture at Harvard University after he lecture a student get up and say to he give we a poem and Mohammed Ali say I we a profound statement about the individual and the community the space in which now in my project of discovery of think about artist of try to define what might be black art cultural movement of the 21st century what that might mean for cultural movement all over this moment the I we seem incredibly prescient totally important to this end the specific project that have make this possible for I be a series of exhibition all title with a f freestyle frequency and Flow which have set out to discover and define the young black artist work in this moment who I feel strongly will continue to work over the next many year this series of exhibition be make specifically to try and question the idea of what it would mean now at this point in history to see art as a catalyst what it mean now at this point in history as we define and redefine culture black culture specifically in my case but culture generally I name this group of artist around a idea which I put out there call post black really mean to define they as artist who come and start they work now look back at history but start in this moment historically it be really in this sense of discovery that I have a new set of question that I be ask this new set of question be what do it mean right now to be African American in America what can artwork say about this where can a museum exist as the place for we all to have this conversation really most exciting about this be think about the energy and the excitement that young artist can bring they work for I be about not always just simply about the aesthetic innovation that they mind imagine that they vision create and put out there in the world but more perhaps importantly through the excitement of the community that they create as important voice that would allow we right now to understand we situation as well as in the future I be continually amazed by the way in which the subject of race can take itself in many place that we do not imagine it should be I be always amazed by the way in which artist be willing to do that in they work it be why I look to art it be why I ask question of art it be why I make exhibition now this exhibition as I say 40 young artist do over the course of eight year and for I it be about consider the implication it be consider the implication of what this generation have to say to the rest of we it be consider what it mean for this artist to be both out in the world as they work travels but in they community as person who be see and think about the issue that face we it be also about think about the creative spirit and nurture it and imagine particularly in urban America about the nurture of the spirit now where perhaps do this end up right now for I it be about re imagine this cultural discourse in a international context so the last iteration of this project have be call Flow with the idea now of create a real network of artist around the world really look not so much from Harlem and out but look across and Flow look at artist all bear on the continent of Africa and as many of we think about that continent and think about what if means to we all in the 21st century I have begin that look through artist through artwork and imagine what they can tell we about the future what they tell we about we future and what they create in they sense of offer we this great possibility of watch that continent emerge as part of we big dialogue so what do I discoverwhen I look at artwork what do I think about when I think about art I feel like the privilege I have have as a curator be not just the discovery of new work the discovery of exciting work but really it have be what I have discover about myself and what I can offer in the space of a exhibition to talk about beauty to talk about power to talk about ourselves and to talk and speak to each other that be what make I get up every day and want to think about this generation of black artist and artist around the world thank you applause
