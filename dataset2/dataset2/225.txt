I write about food I write about cooking I take it quite seriously but I be here to talk about something that be become very important to I in the last year or two it be about food but it be not about cook per se I be go to start with this picture of a beautiful cow I be not a vegetarian this be the old Nixon line right but I still think that this laughter may be this year version of this now that be only a little bit hyperbolic and why do I say it because only once before have the fate of individual person and the fate of all of humanity be so intertwined there be the bomb and there be now and where we go from here be go to determine not only the quality and the length of we individual life but whether if we could see the Earth a century from now we have recognize it it be a holocaust of a different kind and hiding under we desk be not go to help start with the notion that global warming be not only real but dangerous since every scientist in the world now believe this and even President Bush have see the light or pretend to we can take this be a give then hear this please after energy production livestock be the second high contributor to atmosphere alter gas nearly one fifth of all greenhouse gas be generate by livestock production more than transportation now you can make all the joke you want about cow fart but methane be 20 time more poisonous than co2 and it be not just methane livestock be also one of the big culprit in land degradation air and water pollution water shortage and loss of biodiversity there be more like half the antibiotic in this country be not administer to person but to animal but list like this become kind of numb so let I just say this if you be a progressive if you be drive a Prius or you be shop green or you be look for organic you should probably be a semi vegetarian now I be no more anti cattle than I be anti atom but it be all in the way we use this thing there be another piece of the puzzle which Ann Cooper talk about beautifully yesterday and one you already know there be no question none that so call lifestyle disease diabetes heart disease stroke some cancer be disease that be far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world and that be the direct result of eat a Western diet we demand for meat dairy and refine carbohydrate the world consume one billion can or bottle of Coke a day we demand for this thing not we need we want drive we to consume way more calorie than be good for we and that calorie be in food that cause not prevent disease now global warming be unforeseen we do not know that pollution do more than cause bad visibility maybe a few lung disease here and there but you know that be not such a big deal the current health crisis however be a little more the work of the evil empire we be tell we be assure that the more meat and dairy and poultry we eat the healthy we would be no overconsumption of animal and of course junk food be the problem along with we paltry consumption of plant now there be no time to get into the benefit of eat plant here but the evidence be that plant and I want to make this clear it be not the ingredient in plant it be the plant it be not the beta carotene it be the carrot the evidence be very clear that plant promote health this evidence be overwhelming at this point you eat more plant you eat less other stuff you live long not bad but back to animal and junk food what do they have in common one we do not need either of they for health we do not need animal product and we certainly do not need white bread or Coke two both have be market heavily create unnatural demand we be not bear craving whopper or Skittles three they production have be support by government agency at the expense of a more health and Earth friendly diet now let imagine a parallel let pretend that we government support a oil base economy while discourage more sustainable form of energy know all the while that the result would be pollution war and rise cost incredible be not it yet they do that and they do this here it be the same deal the sad thing be when it come to diet be that even when well intention Feds try to do right by we they fail either they be outvote by puppet of agribusiness or they be puppet of agribusiness so when the USDA finally acknowledge that it be plant rather than animal that make person healthy they encourage we via they overly simplistic food pyramid to eat five serving of fruit and vegetable a day along with more carb what they do not tell we be that some carb be good than other and that plant and whole grain should be supplant eat junk food but industry lobbyist would never let that happen and guess what half the person who develop the food pyramid have tie to agribusiness so instead of substitute plant for animal we swell appetite simply become large and the most dangerous aspect of they remain unchanged so call low fat diet so call low carb diet this be not solution but with lot of intelligent person focus on whether food be organic or local or whether we be be nice to animal the most important issue just be not be address now do not get I wrong I like animal and I do not think it be just fine to industrialize they production and to churn they out like they be wrench but there be no way to treat animal well when you be kill 10 billion of they a year that be we number 10 billion if you string all of they chicken cow pig and lamb to the moon they would go there and back five time there and back now my math a little shaky but this be pretty good and it depend whether a pig be four foot long or five foot long but you get the idea that be just the United States and with we hyper consumption of that animal produce greenhouse gas and heart disease kindness might just be a bit of a red herring let get the number of the animal we be kill for eat down and then we will worry about be nice to the one that be leave another red herring might be exemplify by the word locavore which be just name word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary seriously and locavore for that of you who do not know be someone who eat only locally grow food which be fine if you live in California but for the rest of we it be a bit of a sad joke between the official story the food pyramid and the hip locavore vision you have two version of how to improve we eat laughter they both get it wrong though the first at least be populist and the second be elitist how we get to this place be the history of food in the United States and I be go to go through that at least the last hundred year or so very quickly right now a hundred year ago guess what everyone be a locavore even New York have pig farm nearby and ship food all over the place be a ridiculous notion every family have a cook usually a mom and that mom buy and prepare food it be like you romantic vision of Europe Margarine do not exist in fact when margarine be invent several state pass law declare that it have to be dye pink so we have all know that it be a fake there be no snack food and until the 20 until Clarence Birdseye come along there be no frozen food there be no restaurant chain there be neighborhood restaurant run by local person but none of they would think to open another one eat ethnic be unheard of unless you be ethnic and fancy food be entirely French as a aside that of you who remember Dan Aykroyd in the 1970 do Julia Child imitation can see where he get the idea of stab himself from this fabulous slide laughter back in that day before even Julia back in that day there be no philosophy of food you just eat you do not claim to be anything there be no marketing there be no national brand vitamin have not be invent there be no health claim at least not federally sanction one Fats carb proteins they be not bad or good they be food you eat food hardly anything contain more than one ingredient because it be a ingredient the cornflake have not be invent laughter the pop Tart the Pringle Cheez Whiz none of that stuff goldfish swim laughter it be hard to imagine person grow food and they eat food and again everyone eat local in New York a orange be a common Christmas present because it come all the way from Florida from the 30 on road system expand truck take the place of railroad fresh food begin to travel more orange become common in New York the South and West become agricultural hub and in other part of the country suburb take over farmland the effect of this be well know they be everywhere and the death of family farm be part of this puzzle as be almost everything from the demise of the real community to the challenge of find a good tomato even in summer eventually California produce too much food to ship fresh so it become critical to market can and freeze food thus arrive convenience it be sell to proto feminist housewife as a way to cut down on housework now I know everybody over the age of like 45 they mouth be water at this point laughter applause if we have a slide of Salisbury steak even more so right laughter but this may have cut down on housework but it cut down on the variety of food we eat as well many of we grow up never eat a fresh vegetable except the occasional raw carrot or maybe a odd lettuce salad I for one and I be not kid do not eat real spinach or broccoli till I be 19 who need it though meat be everywhere what could be easy more filling or healthy for you family than broil a steak but by then cattle be already raise unnaturally rather than spend they life eat grass for which they stomach be design they be force to eat soy and corn they have trouble digest that grain of course but that be not a problem for producer new drug keep they healthy well they keep they alive healthy be another story thanks to farm subsidy the fine collaboration between agribusiness and Congress soy corn and cattle become king and chicken soon join they on the throne it be during this period that the cycle of dietary and planetary destruction begin the thing we be only realize just now listen to this between 1950 and 2000 the world population double meat consumption increase five fold now someone have to eat all that stuff so we get fast food and this take care of the situation resoundingly home cook remain the norm but its quality be down the tube there be few meal with home cook bread dessert and soup because all of they could be buy at any store not that they be any good but they be there most mom cook like mine a piece of broil meat a quickly make salad with bottled dressing can soup can fruit salad maybe bake or mash potato or perhaps the stupid food ever Minute Rice for dessert store buy ice cream or cookie my mom be not here so I can say this now this kind of cook drive I to learn how to cook for myself laughter it be not all bad by the 70 forward think person begin to recognize the value of local ingredient we tend garden we become interested in organic food we know or we be vegetarian we be not all hippie either some of we be eat in good restaurant and learn how to cook well meanwhile food production have become industrial Industrial perhaps because it be be produce rationally as if it be plastic food gain magical or poisonous power or both many person become fat phobic other worship broccoli as if it be God like but mostly they do not eat broccoli instead they be sell on yogurt yogurt be almost as good as broccoli except in reality the way the industry sell yogurt be to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream similarly let look at a granola bar you think that that might be healthy food but in fact if you look at the ingredient list it be close in form to a Snickers than it be to oatmeal sadly it be at this time that the family dinner be put in a coma if not actually kill the beginning of the heyday of value add food which contain as many soy and corn product as could be cram into it think of the freeze chicken nugget the chicken be feed corn and then its meat be grind up and mix with more corn product to add bulk and binder and then it be fry in corn oil all you do be nuke it what could be good and zap horribly pathetically by the 70 home cooking be in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of food like McNuggets and Hot pocket and we all have we favorite actually make this stuff more appealing than the bland thing that person be serve at home at the same time mass of woman be enter the workforce and cooking simply be not important enough for man to share the burden so now you have get you pizza night you have get you microwave night you have get you graze night you have get you fend for yourself night and so on lead the way what be lead the way meat junk food cheese the very stuff that will kill you so now we clamor for organic food that be good and as evidence that thing can actually change you can now find organic food in supermarket and even in fast food outlet but organic food be not the answer either at least not the way it be currently define let I pose you a question can farm raise salmon be organic when its feed have nothing to do with its natural diet even if the feed itself be supposedly organic and the fish themselves be pack tightly in pen swim in they own filth and if that salmon from Chile and it be kill down there and then fly 5 000 mile whatever dump how much carbon into the atmosphere I do not know pack in Styrofoam of course before land somewhere in the United States and then be truck a few hundred more mile this may be organic in letter but it be surely not organic in spirit now here be where we all meet the locavore the organivore the vegetarian the vegan the gourmet and that of we who be just plain interested in good food even though we have come to this from different point we all have to act on we knowledge to change the way that everyone think about food we need to start act and this be not only a issue of social justice as Ann Cooper say and of course she be completely right but it be also one of global survival which bring I full circle and point directly to the core issue the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food as I say 18 percent of greenhouse gas be attribute to livestock production how much livestock do you need to produce this 70 percent of the agricultural land on Earth 30 percent of the Earth land surface be directly or indirectly devoted to raise the animal we will eat and this amount be predict to double in the next 40 year or so and if the number come in from China be anything like what they look like now it be not go to be 40 year there be no good reason for eat as much meat as we do and I say this as a man who have eat a fair share of corn beef in he life the most common argument be that we need nutrient even though we eat on average twice as much protein as even the industry obsess USDA recommend but listen expert who be serious about disease reduction recommend that adult eat just over half a pound of meat per week what do you think we eat per day half a pound but do not we need meat to be big and strong be not meat eat essential to health will not a diet heavy in fruit and vegetable turn we into godless sissy liberal laughter some of we might think that would be a good thing but no even if we be all steroid fill football player the answer be no in fact there be no diet on Earth that meet basic nutritional need that will not promote growth and many will make you much healthy than ours do we do not eat animal product for sufficient nutrition we eat they to have a odd form of malnutrition and it be kill we to suggest that in the interest of personal and human health American eat 50 percent less meat it be not enough of a cut but it be a start it would seem absurd but that be exactly what should happen and what progressive person forward think person should be do and advocate along with the correspond increase in the consumption of plant I have be write about food more or less omnivorously one might say indiscriminately for about 30 year during that time I have eat and recommend eat just about everything I will never stop eat animal I be sure but I do think that for the benefit of everyone the time have come to stop raise they industrially and stop eat they thoughtlessly Ann Cooper right the USDA be not we ally here we have to take matter into we own hand not only by advocate for a good diet for everyone and that be the hard part but by improve we own and that happen to be quite easy less meat less junk more plant it be a simple formula eat food eat real food we can continue to enjoy we food and we continue to eat well and we can eat even good we can continue the search for the ingredient we love and we can continue to spin yarn about we favorite meal we will reduce not only calorie but we carbon footprint we can make food more important not less and save ourselves by do so we have to choose that path thank you
