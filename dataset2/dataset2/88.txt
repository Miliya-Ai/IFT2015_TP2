I be not quite sure whether I really want to see a snare drum at nine o clock or so in the morning laughter but anyway it be just great to see such a full theater and really I must thank Herbie Hancock and he colleague for such a great presentation applause one of the interesting thing of course be the combination of that raw hand on the instrument and technology and what he say about listen to we young person of course my job be all about listen and my aim really be to teach the world to listen that be my only real aim in life and it sound quite simple but actually it be quite a big big job because you know when you look at a piece of music for example if I just open my little motorbike bag we have here hopefully a piece of music that be full of little black dot on the page and you know we open it up and I read the music so technically I can actually read this I will follow the instruction the tempo marking the dynamics I will do exactly as I be tell and so therefore because time be short if I just play you literally the first maybe two line or so it be very straightforward there be nothing too difficult about the piece but here I be be tell that the piece of music be very quick I be be tell where to play on the drum I be be tell which part of the stick to use and I be be tell the dynamic and I be also be tell that the drum be without snare snare on snare off so therefore if I translate this piece of music we have this idea Drum sound Drum sound end and so on my career would probably last about five year laughter however what I have to do as a musician be do everything that be not on the music everything that there be not time to learn from a teacher or to talk about even from a teacher but it be the thing you notice when you be not actually with you instrument that in fact become so interesting and that you want to explore through this tiny tiny surface of a drum so there we experience the translation now we will experience the interpretation Drum sound Drum sound end applause now my career may last a little long laughter but in a way you know it be the same if I look at you and I see a nice bright young lady with a pink top on I see that you be clutch a teddy bear etc etc so I get a basic idea as to what you might be about what you might like what you might do as a profession etc etc however that be just the initial idea I may have that we all get when we actually look and we try to interpret but actually it be so unbelievably shallow in the same way I look at the music I get a basic idea I wonder what technically might be hard or you know what I want to do just the basic feeling however that be simply not enough and I think what Herbie say please listen listen we have to listen to ourselves first of all if I play for example hold the stick where literally I do not let go of the stick Drum sound you will experience quite a lot of shock come up through the arm and you feel really quite believe it or not detach from the instrument and from the stick even though I be actually hold the stick quite tightly Drum sound by hold it tightly I feel strangely more detached if I just simply let go and allow my hand my arm to be more of a support system suddenly Drum sound I have more dynamic with less effort much more Drum sound and I just feel at last one with the stick and one with the drum and I be do far far less so in the same way that I need time with this instrument I need time with person in order to interpret they not just translate they but interpret they if for example I play just a few bar of a piece of music for which I think of myself as a technician that be someone who be basically a percussion player Marimba sound Marimba sound end and so on if I think of myself as a musician Marimba sound Marimba sound end and so on there be a little bit of a difference there that be worth just applause think about and I remember when I be 12 year old and I start play timpani and percussion and my teacher say well how be we go to do this you know music be about listen and I say yes I agree with that so what be the problem and he say well how be you go to hear this how be you go to hear that and I say well how do you hear it he say well I think I hear it through here and I say well I think I do too but I also hear it through my hand through my arm cheekbone my scalp my tummy my chest my leg and so on and so we begin we lesson every single time tuning drum in particular the kettle drum or timpani to such a narrow pitch interval so something like Marimba sound that of a difference then gradually Marimba sound and gradually Marimba sound and it be amazing that when you do open you body up and open you hand up to allow the vibration to come through that in fact the tiny tiny difference Marimba sound can be feel with just the tiny part of you finger there and so what we would do be that I would put my hand on the wall of the music room and together we would listen to the sound of the instrument and really try to connect with that sound far far more broadly than simply depend on the ear because of course the ear be subject to all sort of thing the room we happen to be in the amplification the quality of the instrument the type of stick Marimba sound Marimba sound end etc etc they be all different Marimba sound Marimba sound end same amount of weight but different sound color and that be basically what we be we be just human being but we all have we own little sound color as it be that make up this extraordinary personality and character and interest and thing and as I grow old I then audition for the Royal Academy of Music in London and they say well no we will not accept you because we have not a clue you know of the future of a so call deaf musician and I just could not quite accept that and so therefore I say to they well look if you refuse if you refuse I through that reason as oppose to the ability to perform and to understand and love the art of create sound then we have to think very very hard about the person you do actually accept and as a result once we get over a little hurdle and have to audition twice they accept I and not only that what have happen be that it change the whole role of the music institution throughout the United Kingdom under no circumstance be they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of whether someone have no arm no leg they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it be support on a stand no circumstance at all be use to refuse any entry and every single entry have to be listen to experienced and then base on the musical ability then that person could either enter or not and so therefore this in turn mean that there be a extremely interesting bunch of student who arrive in this various music institution and I have to say many of they now in the professional orchestra throughout the world the interesting thing about this as well though applause be quite simply that not only be person connect with sound which be basically all of we we well know that music really be we daily medicine I say music but actually I mean sound because some of the extraordinary thing I have experience as a musician when you may have a 15 year old lad who have get the most incredible challenge who may not be able to control he movement who may be deaf who may be blind etc etc suddenly if that young lad sit close to this instrument and perhaps even lie underneath the marimba and you play something that be so incredibly organ like almost I do not really have the right stick perhaps but something like this let I change soft marimba sound soft marimba sound end something that be so unbelievably simple but he would be experience something that I would not be because I be on top of the sound I have the sound come this way he would have the sound come through the resonator if there be no resonator on here we would have Marimba sound so he would have a fullness of sound that that of you in the front few row would not experience that of you in the back few row would not experience either every single one of we depend on where we be sit will experience this sound quite quite differently and of course be the participator of the sound and that be start from the idea of what type of sound I want to produce for example this sound no sound can you hear anything exactly because I be not even touch it laughter but yet we get the sensation of something happen in the same way that when I see a tree move then I imagine that tree make a rustling sound do you see what I mean whatever the eye see then there be always sound happen so there be always always that huge I mean just this kaleidoscope of thing to draw from so all of my performance be base on entirely what I experience and not by learn a piece of music put on someone else interpretation of it buy all the cd possible of that particular piece of music and so on and so forth because that be not give I enough of something that be so raw and so basic and something that I can fully experience the journey of so it may be that in certain hall this dynamic may well work soft marimba sound soft marimba sound end it may be that in other hall they be simply not go to experience that at all and so therefore my level of soft gentle playing may have to be Marimba sound Marimba sound end do you see what I mean so because of this explosion in access to sound especially through the Deaf community this have not only affect how music institution how school for the deaf treat sound and not just as a means of therapy although of course be a participator of music that definitely be the case as well but it be mean that acoustician have have to really think about the type of hall they put together there be so few hall in this world that actually have very good acoustic dare I say but by that I mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine the tiny soft soft sound to something that be so broad so huge so incredible there be always something it may sound good up there may not be so good there it may be great there but terrible up there maybe terrible over there but not too bad there etc etc so to find a actual hall be incredible for which you can play exactly what you imagine without it be cosmetically enhance so therefore acoustician be actually in conversation with person who be hear impair and who be participator of sound and this be quite interesting I can not give you any detail as far as what be actually happen with that hall but it be just the fact that they be go to a group of person for whom so many year we have be say well how on earth can they experience music they be deaf we go like that and we imagine that be what deafness be about or we go like that and we imagine that be what blindness be about if we see someone in a wheelchair we assume they can not walk it may be that they can walk three four five step that to they mean they can walk in a year time it could be two extra step in another year time three extra step that be hugely important aspect to think about so when we do listen to each other it be unbelievably important for we to really test we listening skill to really use we body as a resonate chamber to stop the judgment for I as a musician who deal with 99 percent of new music it be very easy for I to say oh yes I like that piece no I do not like that piece and so on and I just find that I have to give that piece of music real time it may be that the chemistry be not quite right between myself and that particular piece of music but that do not mean I have the right to say it be a bad piece of music and you know one of the great thing about be a musician be that it be so unbelievably fluid so there be no rule no right no wrong this way that way if I ask you to clap maybe I can do this if I can just say please clap and create the sound of thunder I be assume we have all experienced thunder now I do not mean just the sound I mean really listen to that thunder within yourselve and please try to create that through you clapping try just please try loud clapping sound clapping end snow laughter Snow soft clapping sound have you ever hear snow audience no Evelyn Glennie well then stop clapping laughter try again try again snow no sound see you be awake rain light clapping sound EG laugh not bad not bad the interesting thing here though be that I ask a group of kid not so long ago exactly the same question now great imagination thank you very much however not one of you get out of you seat to think right how can I clap ok maybe clap sound maybe I can use my jewelry to create extra sound maybe I can use the other part of my body to create extra sound not a single one of you think about clapping in a slightly different way other than sit in you seat there and use two hand in the same way when we listen to music we assume that it be all be feed through here this be how we experience music of course it be not we experience thunder thunder thunder think think think listen listen listen now what can we do with thunder I remember my teacher when I first start my very first lesson I be all prepare with stick ready to go and instead of he say ok Evelyn please foot slightly apart arm at a more or less 90 degree angle stick in a more or less v shape keep this amount of space here etc please keep you back straight etc etc etc where I be just probably go to end up absolutely rigid frozen and I would not be able to strike the drum because I be think of so many other thing he say Evelyn take this drum away for seven day and I will see you next week so heavens what be I to do I no long require the stick I be not allow to have this stick I have to basically look at this particular drum see how it be make what this little lug do what the snare do turn it upside down experiment with the shell Drum sound experiment with the head Drum sound experiment with my body Drum sound experiment with jewelry experiment with all sort of thing Drum sound Drum sound end and of course I return with all sort of bruise laughter but nevertheless it be such a unbelievable experience because where on earth be you go to experience that in a piece of music where on earth be you go to experience that in a study book so we never ever deal with actual study book so for example one of the thing that we learn when we be deal with be a percussion player as oppose to a musician be basically straightforward single stroke roll Drum sound like that and then we get a little fast Drum sound and a little fast Drum sound and a little fast and so on and so forth what do this piece require single stroke roll Drum sound so why can not I then do that whilst learn a piece of music and that be exactly what he do and interestingly the old I become and when I become a full time student at a so call music institution all of that go out of the window we have to study from study book and constantly the question well why why what be this relate to I need to play a piece of music well this will help you control well how why do I need to learn that I need to relate it to a piece of music you know I need to say something why be I practice paradiddle Drum sound be it just literally for control for hand stick control why be I do that I need to have the reason and the reason have to be by say something through the music and by say something through music which basically be sound we then can reach all sort of thing to all sort of person but I do not want to take responsibility of you emotional baggage that be up to you when you walk through a hall because that then determine what and how we listen to certain thing I may feel sorrowful or happy or exhilarated or angry when I play certain piece of music but I be not necessarily want you to feel exactly the same thing so please the next time you go to a concert just allow you body to open up allow you body to be this resonating chamber be aware that you be not go to experience the same thing as the performer be the performer be in the bad possible position for the actual sound because they be hear the contact of the stick Drum sound on the drum or the mallet on the bit of wood or the bow on the string etc or the breath that be create the sound from wind and brass they be experience that rawness there but yet they be experience something so unbelievably pure which be before the sound be actually happen please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike or breath be be pull just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that I wish I have experience the whole journey of this particular conference rather than just arrive last night but I hope maybe we can share one or two thing as the day progress but thank you very much for have I applause applause end Music Music end applause
