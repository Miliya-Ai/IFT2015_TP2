there be a great big elephant in the room call the economy so let start talk about that I want to give you a current picture of the economy that be what I have behind myself laughter but of course what we have to remember be this and what you have to think about be when you be dance in the flame what be next so what I be go to try to do in the next 17 and a half minute be I be go to talk first about the flame where we be in the economy and then I be go to take three trend that have take place at TED over the last 25 year and that will take place in this conference and I will try and bring they together and I will try and give you a sense of what the ultimate reboot look like that three trend be the ability to engineer cell the ability to engineer tissue and robot and somehow it will all make sense but anyway let start with the economy there be a couple of really big problem that be still sit there one be leverage and the problem with leverage be it make the U S financial system look like this laughter so a normal commercial bank have nine to 10 time leverage that mean for every dollar you deposit it loan out about nine or 10 a normal investment bank be not a deposit bank it be a investment bank it have 15 to 20 time it turn out that b of a in September have 32 time and you friendly Citibank have 47 time oops that mean every bad loan go bad 47 time over and that of course be the reason why all of you be make such generous and wonderful donation to this nice folk and as you think about that you have get to wonder so what do bank have in store for you now laughter it be not pretty the government meanwhile have be act like Santa Claus we all love Santa Claus right but the problem with Santa clause be if you look at the mandatory spending of what this folk have be do and promise folk it turn out that in 1967 38 percent be mandatory spending on what we call entitlement and then by 2007 it be 68 percent and we be not suppose to run into 100 percent until about 2030 except we have be so busy give away a trillion here a trillion there that we have bring that date of reckon forward to about 2017 and we think we be go to be able to lay this debt off on we kid but guess what we be go to start to pay they and the problem with this stuff be now that the bill come due it turn out Santa be not quite as cute when it be summertime right laughter here be some advice from one of the large investor in the United States this guy run the China Investment Corporation he be the main buyer of U S Treasury bond and he give a interview in December here be he first bit of advice and here be he second bit of advice and by the way the Chinese Prime Minister reiterate this at Davos last Sunday this stuff be get serious enough that if we do not start pay attention to the deficit we be go to end up lose the dollar and then all bet be off let I show you what it look like I think I can safely say that I be the only trillionaire in this room this be a actual bill and it be 10 triliion dollar the only problem with this bill be it be not really worth very much that be eight buck last week four buck this week a buck next week and that be what happen to currency when you do not stand behind they so the next time somebody as cute as this show up on you doorstep and sometimes this creature call Chrysler and sometimes Ford and sometimes whatever you want you have just get to say no and you have get to start banish a word that be call entitlement and the reason we have to do that in the short term be because we have just run out of cash if you look at the federal budget this be what it look like the orange slice be what be discretionary everything else be mandate it make no difference if we cut out the bridge to Alaska in the overall scheme of thing so what we have to start think about do be cap we medical spending because that be a monster that be simply go to eat the entire budget we have get to start think about ask person to retire a little bit late if you be 60 to 65 you retire on time you 401 k just get nail if you be 50 to 60 we want you to work two year more if you be under 50 we want you to work four more year the reason why that be reasonable be when you grandparent be give Social Security they get it at 65 and be expect to check out at 68 sixty eight be young today we have also get to cut the military about three percent a year we have get to limit other mandatory spending we have get to quit borrowing as much because otherwise the interest be go to eat that whole pie and we have get to end up with a small government and if we do not start change this trend line we be go to lose the dollar and start to look like Iceland I get what you be think this be go to happen when hell freeze over but let I remind you this December it do snow in Vegas laughter here be what happen if you do not address this stuff so Japan have a fiscal real estate crisis back in the late 80 and its 225 large company today be worth one quarter of what they be 18 year ago we do not fix this now how would you like to see a Dow 3 500 in 2026 because that be the consequence of not deal with this stuff and unless you want this person to not just become the CFO of Florida but the United States we have good deal with this stuff that be the short term that be the flame part that be the financial crisis now right behind the financial crisis there be a second and big wave that we need to talk about that wave be much large much more powerful and that be of course the wave of technology and what be really important in this stuff be as we cut we also have to grow among other thing because startup company be 02 percent of U S GDP investmentm and they be about 17 8 percent of output it be group like that in this room that generate the future of the U S economy and that be what we have get to keep grow we do not have to keep grow this bridge to nowhere so let bring a romance novelist into this conversation and that be where this three trend come together that be where the ability to engineer microbe the ability to engineer tissue and the ability to engineer robot begin to lead to a reboot and let I recap some of the stuff you have see Craig Venter show up last year and show you the first fully programmable cell that act like hardware where you can insert dna and have it boot up as a different species in parallel the folk at MIT have be build a standard registry of biological part so think of it as a Radio Shack for biology you can go out and get you proteins you rna you dna whatever and start build stuff in 2006 they bring together high school student and college student and start to build this little odd creature they just happen to be alive instead of circuit board here be one of the first thing they build so cell have this cycle first they do not grow then they grow exponentially then they stop grow graduate student want a way of tell which stage they be in so they engineer this cell so that when they be grow in the exponential phase they would smell like wintergreen and when they stop grow they would smell like banana and you could tell very easily when you experiment be work and be not and where it be in the phase this get a bit more complicated two year later twenty one country come together dozen of team they start compete the team from Rice University start to engineer the substance in red wine that make red wine good for you into beer so you take resveratrol and you put it into beer of course one of the judge be wander by and he go wow Cancer fight beer there be a God laughter the team from Taiwan be a little bit more ambitious they try to engineer bacterium in such a way that they would act as you kidney four year ago I show you this picture and person ooh and ahh because Cliff Tabin have be able to grow a extra wing on a chicken and that be very cool stuff back then but now move from bacterial engineering to tissue engineering let I show you what be happen in that period of time two year ago you see this creature a almost extinct animal from Xochimilco Mexico call a axolotl that can be generate its limb you can freeze half its heart it regrow you can freeze half the brain it regrow it be almost like leave Congress laughter but now you do not have to have the animal itself to regenerate because you can build clone mouse molar in Petri dish and of course if you can build mouse molar in Petri dish you can grow human molar in Petri dish this should not surprise you right I mean you be bear with no tooth you give away all you tooth to the tooth fairy you be grow a set of tooth but then if you lose one of that second set of tooth they do not regrow unless if you be a lawyer laughter but of course for most of we we know how to grow tooth and therefore we can take adult stem tooth put they on a biodegradable mold re grow a tooth and simply implant it and we can do it with other thing so a Spanish woman who be die of t b have a donor trachea they take all the cell off the trachea they spraypaint she stem cell onto that cartilage she regrew she own trachea and 72 hour later it be implant she be now run around with she kid this be go on in Tony Atala lab in Wake Forest where he be re grow ear for injured soldier and he be also re grow bladder so there be now nine woman walk around Boston with re grow bladder which be much more pleasant than walk around with a whole bunch of plastic bag for the rest of you life this be kind of get boring right I mean you understand where this story be go but I mean it get more interesting last year this group be able to take all the cell off a heart leave just the cartilage then they spray stem cell onto that heart from a mouse that stem cell self organize and that heart start to beat Life happen this may be one of the ultimate paper this be do in Japan and in the U S publish at the same time and it reboot skin cell into stem cell last year that mean that you can take the stuff right here and turn it into almost anything in you body and this be become common it be move very quickly it be move in a whole series of place third trend robot that of we of a certain age grow up expect that by now we would have Rosie the Robot from the Jetsons in we house and all we have get be a Roomba laughter we also think we would have this robot to warn we of danger do not happen and this be robot engineer for a flat world right so Rosie run around on skate and the other one run on flat thread if you do not have a flat world that be not good which be why the robot we be design today be a little different this be Boston Dynamics BigDog and this be about as close as you can get to a physical turing test o k so let I remind you a turing test be where you have get a wall you be talk to somebody on the other side of the wall and when you do not know if that thing be human or animal that be when computer have reach human intelligence this be not a intelligence Turing rest but this be as close as you can get to a physical turing test and this stuff be move very quickly and by the way that thing can carry about 350 pound of weight this be not the only interesting robot you have also get fly the size of fly that be be make by Robert Wood at Harvard you have get stickybot that be be make at Stanford and as you bring this thing together as you bring cell biological tissue engineering and mechanic together you begin to get some really odd question in the last Olympics this gentleman who have several world record in the Special Olympics try to run in the normal Olympics the only issue with Oscar Pistorius be he be bear without bone in the low part of he leg he come within about a second of qualify he sue to be allow to run and he win the suit but do not qualify by time Next Olympics you can bet that Oscar or one of Oscar successor be go to make the time and two or three Olympics after that they be go to be unbeatable and as you bring this trend together and as you think of what it mean to take person who be profoundly deaf who can now begin to hear I mean remember the evolution of hear aid right I mean you grandparent have this great big cone and then you parent have this odd box that would squawk at odd time during dinner and now we have this little bud that nobody see and now you have cochlear implant that go into person head and allow the deaf to begin to hear now they can not hear as well as you and I can but in 10 or 15 machine generation they will and this be machine generation not human generation and about two or three year after they can hear as well as you and I can they will be able to hear maybe how bat sing or how whale talk or how dog talk and other type of tonal scale they will be able to focus they hear they will be able to increase the sensitivity decrease the sensitivity do a series of thing that we can not do and the same thing be happen in eye this be a group in Germany that be begin to engineer eye so that person who be blind can begin to see light and dark very primitive and then they will be able to see shape and then they will be able to see color and then they will be able to see in definition and one day they will see as well as you and I can and a couple of year after that they will be able to see in ultraviolet they will be able to see in infrared they will be able to focus they eye they will be able to come into a microfocus they will do stuff you and I can not do all of this thing be come together and it be a particularly important thing to understand as we worry about the flame of the present to keep a eye on the future and of course the future be look back 200 year because next week be the 200th anniversary of Darwin birth and it be the 150th anniversary of the publication of the origin of species and Darwin of course argue that evolution be a natural state it be a natural state in everything that be alive include hominid there have actually be 22 species of hominid that have be around have evolve have wander in different place have go extinct it be common for hominid to evolve and that be the reason why as you look at the hominid fossil record erectus and heidelbergensis and floresiensis and neanderthal and Homo sapiens all overlap the common state of affair be to have overlap version of hominid not one and as you think of the implication of that here be a brief history of the universe the universe be create 13 7 billion year ago and then you create all the star and all the planet and all the galaxy and all the Milky Ways and then you create Earth about 4 5 billion year ago and then you get life about four billion year ago and then you get hominid about 0 006 billion year ago and then you get we version of hominid about 0 0015 billion year ago Ta dah maybe the reason for thr creation of the universe and all the galaxy and all the planet and all the energy and all the dark energy and all the rest of stuff be to create what be in this room maybe not that would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint laughter so if that be not the purpose of the universe then what be next laughter I think what we be go to see be we be go to see a different species of hominid I think we be go to move from a Homo sapiens into a homo evolutis and I think this be not 1 000 year out I think most of we be go to glance at it and we grandchild be go to begin to live it and a homo evolutis bring together this three trend into a hominid that take direct and deliberate control over the evolution of he species she species and other species and that of course would be the ultimate reboot thank you very much applause
