the dirty Jobs crew and I be call to a little town in Colorado call Craig it be only a couple dozen square mile it be in the Rockies and the job in question be sheep rancher my role on the show for that of you who have not see it it be pretty simple I be a apprentice and I work with the person who do the job in question and my responsibility be to simply try and keep up and give a honest account of what it be like to be this person for one day in they life the job in question herd sheep great we go to Craig and we check into a hotel and I realize the next day that castration be go to be a absolute part of this work normally I never do any research at all but this be a touchy subject and I work for the Discovery Channel and we want to portray accurately whatever it be we do and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animal so I call the Humane Society and I say look I be go to be castrate some lamb can you tell I the deal and they be like yeah it be pretty straightforward they use a band basically a rubber band like this only a little small this one be actually around the playing card I get yesterday laughter but it have a certain familiarity to it and I say well what exactly be the process and they say the band be apply to the tail tightly and then another band be apply to the scrotum tightly blood flow be slowly retard a week later the part in question fall off great get it ok I call the SPCA to confirm this they confirm it I also call PETA just for fun and they do not like it but they confirm it ok that be basically how you do it so the next day I go out and I be give a horse and we go get the lamb and we take they to a pen that we build and we go about the business of animal husbandry Melanie be the wife of Albert Albert be the shepherd in question Melanie pick up the lamb one hand on both leg on the right likewise on the left Lamb go on the post she open it up alright great Albert go in I follow Albert the crew be around I always watch the process do the first time before I try it be a apprentice you know you do that Albert reach in he pocket to pull out you know this black rubber band but what come out instead be a knife and I be like hmm that be not rubber at all you know laughter and he kind of flick it open in a way that catch the sun that be just come over the Rockies it be very laughter it be it be impressive in the space of about two second Albert have the knife between the cartilage of the tail right next to the butt of the lamb and very quickly the tail be go and in the bucket that I be hold a second later with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger he have the scrotum firmly in he grasp and he pull it toward he like so and he take the knife and he put it on the tip now you think you know what be come Michael you do not ok laughter he snip it throw the tip over he shoulder and then grab the scrotum and push it upward and then he head dip down obscure my view but what I hear be a slurping sound and a noise that sound like Velcro be yank off a sticky wall and I be not even kid can we roll the video no I be kid we do not laughter I think it good to talk in picture I do something now I have never ever do on a dirty Jobs shoot ever I say Time out Stop you guy know the show we use take one we do not do take two there be no writing there be no scripting there be no nonsense we do not fool around we do not rehearse we shoot what we get I say stop this be nuts I mean laughter this be crazy we can not do this and Albert like what and I be like I do not know what just happen but there be testicle in this bucket and that be not how we do it he say well that be how we do it I say why would you do it this way and before I even let he explain I say I want to do it the right way with the rubber band and he say like the Humane Society I say yes like the Humane Society let do something that do not make the lamb squeal and bleed we be on in five continent dude we be on twice a day on the Discovery we can not do this he say ok he go to he box and pull out a bag of this little rubber band Melanie pick up another lamb put it on the post band go on the tail band go on the scrotum Lamb go on the ground lamb take two step fall down get up shake a little take another couple step fall down I be like this be not a good sign for this lamb at all get up walk to the corner it be quiver and it lie down and it be in obvious distress and I be look at the lamb and I say Albert how long when do he get up he be like a day I say a day how long do it take they to fall off a week meanwhile the lamb that he have just do he little procedure on be you know he be just prance around bleeding stop he be you know nibble on some grass frolic and I be just so blow away at how completely wrong I be in that second and I be remind how utterly wrong I be so much of the time laughter and I be especially remind of what a ridiculously short straw I have that day because now I have to do what Albert have just do and there be like 100 of this lamb in the pen and suddenly this whole thing start to feel like a German porno and I be like laughter Melanie pick up the lamb put it on the post open it up Albert hand I the knife I go in tail come off I go in I grab the scrotum tip come off Albert instruct push it way up there I do push it further I do the testicle emerge they look like thumb come right at you and he say bite em just bite em off laughter and I hear he I hear all the word laughter like how do I get here how do I mean how do I get here it be just it be one of that moment where the brain go off on its own and suddenly I be stand there in the Rockies and all I can think of be the Aristotelian definition of a tragedy you know Aristotle say a tragedy be that moment when the hero come face to face with he true identity laughter and I be like what be this jack up metaphor I do not like what I be think right now and I can not get this think out of my head and I can not get that vision out of my sight so I do what I have to do I go in and I take they I take they like this and I yank my head back and I be stand there with two testicle on my chin laughter and now I can not get I can not shake the metaphor I be still in Poetics in Aristotle and I be think out of nowhere two term come crash into my head that I have not hear since my classic professor in college drill they there and they be anagnorisis and peripeteia anagnorisis and peripeteia anagnorisis be the Greek word for discovery literally the transition from ignorance to knowledge be anagnorisis it be what we network do it be what dirty Jobs be and I be up to my neck in anagnorise every single day great the other word peripeteia that be the moment in the great tragedy Euripides and Sophocles that be the moment where Oedipus have he moment where he suddenly realize that hot chick he be be sleep with and have baby with be he mother that be peripety or peripeteia and this metaphor in my head I have get anagnorisis and peripeteia on my chin laughter I have get to tell you it be such a great device though when you start to look for peripeteium you find it everywhere I mean Bruce Willis in the Sixth sense right spend the whole movie try to help the little kid who see dead person and then boom oh I be dead Peripeteia you know it be crush when the audience see it the right way neo in the Matrix you know oh I be live in a computer program that be weird this discovery that lead to sudden realization and I have be have they over 200 dirty job I have they all the time but that one that one drill something home in a way that I just be not prepare for and as I stand there look at the happy lamb that I have just defile but it look ok look at that poor other little thing that I have do it the right way on and I just be strike by if I be wrong about that and if I be wrong so often in a literal way what other peripatetic misconception might I be able to comment upon because look I be not a social anthropologist but I have a friend who be and I talk to he laughter and he say hey Mike look I do not know if you brain be interested in this sort of thing or not but do you realize you have shoot in every state you have work in mining you have work in fishing you have work in steel you have work in every major industry you have have you back shoulder to shoulder with this guy that we politician be desperate to relate to every four year right I can still see Hillary do the shot of rye dribble down she chin with the steel worker I mean this be the person that I work with every single day and if you have something to say about they thought collectively it might be time to think about it because dude you know four year so that be in my head testicle be on my chin thought be bounce around and after that shoot dirty Jobs really do not change in term of what the show be but it change for I personally and now when I talk about the show I no long just tell the story you hear and 190 like it I do but I also start to talk about some of the other thing I get wrong some of the other notion of work that I have just be assume be sacrosanct and they be not person with dirty job be happy than you think as a group they be the happy person I know and I do not want to start whistle look for the union label and all that happy worker crap I be just tell you that this be balanced person who do unthinkable work Roadkill picker upper whistle while they work I swear to God I do it with they they have get this amazing sort of symmetry to they life and I see it over and over and over again so I start to wonder what would happen if we challenge some of this sacred cow follow you passion we have be talk about it here for the last 36 hour follow you passion what could possibly be wrong with that it be probably the bad advice I ever get laughter follow you dream and go broke right I mean that be all I hear grow up I do not know what to do with my life but I be tell if you follow you passion it be go to work out I can give you 30 example right now Bob Combs the pig farmer in Las Vegas who collect the uneaten scrap of food from the casino and feed they to he swine why because there be so much protein in the stuff we do not eat he pig grow at twice the normal speed and he be one rich pig farmer he be good for the environment he spend he day do this incredible service and he smell like hell but God bless he he be make a great living you ask he do you follow you passion here and he would laugh at you the guy worth he just get offer like 60 million dollar for he farm and turn it down outside of Vegas he do not follow he passion he step back and he watch where everybody be go and he go the other way and I hear that story over and over Matt Freund a dairy farmer in New Canaan Connecticut who wake up one day and realize the crap from he cow be worth more than they milk if he could use it to make this biodegradable flowerpot now he be sell they to Walmart right follow he passion the guy come on so I start to look at passion I start to look at efficiency vs effectiveness as Tim talk about early that be a huge distinction I start to look at teamwork and determination and basically all that platitude they call successory that hang with that schmaltzy art in boardroom around the world right now that stuff it be suddenly all be turn on its head Safety Safety first be go back to OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society what if OSHA get it wrong I mean this be heresy what I be about to say but what if it be really safety third right laughter no I mean really what I mean to say be I value my safety on this crazy job as much as the person that I be work with but the one who really get it do they be not out there talk about safety first they know that other thing come first the business of do the work come first the business of get it do and I will never forget up in the Bering Sea I be on a crab boat with the deadly catch guy which I also work on in the first season we be about 100 mile off the coast of Russia 50 foot sea big wave green water come over the wheelhouse right most hazardous environment I have ever see and I be back with a guy lash the pot down so I be 40 foot off the deck which be like look down at the top of you shoe you know and it be do this in the ocean unspeakably dangerous I scamper down I go into the wheelhouse and I say with some level of incredulity captain OSHA and he say OSHA Ocean and he point out there laughter but in that moment what he say next can not be repeat in the Lower 48 it can not be repeat on any factory floor or any construction site but he look at I and say Son he be my age by the way he call I son I love that he say Son I be the captain of a crab boat my responsibility be not to get you home alive my responsibility be to get you home rich laughter you want to get home alive that be on you and for the rest of that day safety first I mean I be like so the idea that we create this sense of complacency when all we do be talk about somebody else responsibility as though it be we own and vice versa anyhow a whole lot of thing I could talk at length about the many little distinction we make and the endless list of way that I get it wrong but what it all come down to be this I have form a theory and I be go to share it now in my remain 2 minute and 30 second it go like this we have declare war on work as a society all of we it be a civil war it be a cold war really we do not set out to do it and we do not twist we mustache in some machiavellian way but we have do it and we have wage this war on at least four front certainly in Hollywood the way we portray work person on tv it be laughable if there be a plumber he be 300 pound and he be get a giant butt crack admit it you see he all the time that be what plumber look like right we turn they into hero or we turn they into punch line that be what tv do we try hard on dirty Jobs not to do that which be why I do the work and I do not cheat but we have wage this war on Madison Avenue so many of the commercial that come out there in the way of a message what be really be say you life would be good if you could work a little less do not have to work so hard get home a little early could retire a little fast punch out a little soon it be all in there over and over again and again Washington I can not even begin to talk about the deal and policy in place that affect the bottom line reality of the available job because I do not really know I just know that that be a front in this war and right here guy Silicon Valley I mean how many person have a iPhone on they right now how many person have they BlackBerry we be plug in we be connect I would never suggest for a second that something bad have come out of the tech revolution good grief not to this crowd laughter but I would suggest that innovation without imitation be a complete waste of time and nobody celebrate imitation the way dirty Jobs guy know it have to be do you iPhone without that person make the same interface the same circuitry the same board over and over all of that that be what make it equally as possible as the genius that go inside of it so we have get this new toolbox you know we tool today do not look like shovel and pick they look like the stuff we walk around with and so the collective effect of all of that have be this marginalization of lot and lot of job and I realize probably too late in this game I hope not because I do not know if I can do 200 more of this thing but we be go to do as many as we can and to I the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with be that fact that I get it wrong about a lot of thing not just the testicle on my chin I get a lot wrong so we be think by we I mean I laughter that the thing to do be to talk about a pr campaign for work manual labor skilled labor somebody need to be out there talk about the forget benefit I be talk about grandfather stuff the stuff a lot we probably grow up with but we have kind of you know kind of lose a little Barack want to create two and a half million job the infrastructure be a huge deal this war on work that I suppose exist have casualty like any other war the infrastructure be the first one decline trade school enrollment be the second one every single year few electrician few carpenter few plumber few welder few pipe fitter few steam fitter the infrastructure job that everybody be talk about create be that guy the one that have be in decline over and over meanwhile we have get two trillion dollar at a minimum accord to the American society of civil engineer that we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure which be currently rate at a d minus so if I be run for anything and I be not I would simply say that the job we hope to make and the job we hope to create be not go to stick unless they be job that person want and I know the point of this conference be to celebrate thing that be near and dear to we but I also know that clean and dirty be not opposite they be two side of the same coin just like innovation and imitation like risk and responsibility like peripeteia and anagnorisis like that poor little lamb who I hope be not quiver anymore and like my time that be go it be be great talk to you and get back to work will you applause
