when most person think about the beginning of AIDS they be go to think back to the 1980 and certainly this be the decade in which we discover AIDS and the virus that cause it HIV but in fact this virus cross over into human many decade before from chimpanzee where the virus originate into human who hunt this ape this photo be take before the Great Depression in Brazzaville Congo at this time there be thousand of individual we think that be infect with HIV so I have a couple of really important question for you if this virus be in thousand of individual at this point why be it the case that it take we until 1984 to be able to discover this virus ok now more importantly have we be there in the 40 and 50 60 have we see this disease have we understand exactly what be go on with it how might that have change and completely transform the nature of the way this pandemic move in fact this be not unique to HIV the vast majority of virus come from animal and you can kind of think of this as a pyramid of this bubble up of virus from animal into human population but only at the very top of this pyramid do this thing become completely human nevertheless we spend the vast majority of we energy focus on this level of the pyramid try to tackle thing that be already completely adapt to human being that be go to be very very difficult to address as we have see in the case of HIV so during the last 15 year I have be work to actually study the early interface here what I have label viral chatter which be a term coin by my mentor Don Burke this be the idea that we can study the sort of ping of this virus into human population the movement of this agent over into human and by capture this moment we might be able to move to a situation where we can catch they early ok so this be a picture and I be go to show you some picture now from the field this be a picture of a central African hunter it be actually a fairly common picture one of the thing I want you to note from it be blood that you see a tremendous amount of blood contact this be absolutely key for we this be a very intimate form of connection so if we be go to study viral chatter we need to get to this population who have intensive contact with wild animal and so we have be study person like this individual we collect blood from they other specimen we look at the disease which be in the animal as well as the human and ideally this be go to allow we to catch this thing early on as they be move over into human population and the basic objective of this work be not to just go out once and look at this individual but to establish thousand of individual in this population that we would monitor continuously on a regular basis when they be sick we would collect specimen from they we would actually enlist they which we have do now to collect specimen from animal we give they this little piece of filter paper when they sample from animal they collect the blood on the filter paper and this allow we to identify yet unknown virus from exactly the right animal the one that be actually be hunt Video Narrator Deep in a remote region of Cameroon two hunter stalk they prey they name be Patrice and Patee they be search for bush meat forest animal they can kill to feed they family Patrice and Patee set out most day to go out hunting in the forest around they home they have a series of trap of snare that they have set up to catch wild pig snake monkey rodent anything they can really patrice and Patee have be out for hour but find nothing the animal be simply go we stop for a drink of water then there be a rustle in the brush a group of hunter approach they pack load with wild game there be at least three virus that you know about which be in this particular monkey Nathan Wolfe this species yeah and there be many many more pathogen that be present in this animal this individual be at specific risk particularly if there be blood contact they be at risk for transmission and possibly infection with novel virus Narrator as the hunter display they kill something surprising happen they show we filter paper they have use to collect the animal blood the blood will be test for zoonotic virus part of a program Dr Wolfe have spend year set up NW so this be from this animal right here Greater Spot Nosed Guenon every person who have one of that filter paper have at least at a minimum be through we basic health education about the risk associate with this activity which presumably from we perspective give they the ability to decrease they own risk and then obviously the risk to they family the village the country and the world NW OK before I continue I think it be important to take just a moment to talk about bush meat Bush meat be the hunting of wild game ok and you can consider all sort of different bush meat I be go to be talk about this when you child and grandchild sort of pose question to you about this period of time one of the thing they be go to ask you be how it be they we allow some of we close live relative some of the most valuable and endangered species on we planet to go extinct because we be not able to address some of the issue of poverty in this part of the world but in fact that be not the only question they be go to ask you about this they be also go to ask you the question that when we know that this be the way that HIV enter into the human population and that other disease have the potential to enter like this why do we let this behavior continue why do we not find some other solution to this they be go to say in region of profound instability throughout the world where you have intense poverty where population be grow and you do not have sustainable resource like this this be go to lead to food insecurity but they be also go to ask you probably a different question it be one that I think we all need to ask ourselves which be why we think the responsibility rest with this individual here now this be the individual you can see just right up over he right shoulder this be the individual that hunt the monkey from the last picture that I show you ok take a look at he shirt you know take a look at he face Bush meat be one of the central crisis which be occur in we population right now in humanity on this planet but it can not be the fault of somebody like this ok and solve it can not be he responsibility alone there be no easy solution but what I be say to you be that we neglect this problem at we own peril so in 1998 along with my mentor Don Burke and Colonel Mpoudi Ngole we go to actually start this work in Central Africa to work with hunter in this part of the world and my job at that time I be a post doctoral fellow and I be really task with set this up so I say to myself ok great we be go to collect all kind of specimen we be go to go to all this different location it be go to be wonderful you know I look at the map I pick out 17 site I figure no problem laughter needless to say I be drastically wrong this be challenging work to do fortunately I have and continue to have a absolutely wonderful team of colleague and collaborator in my own team and that be the only way that this work can really occur we have a whole range of challenge about this work one of they be just obtain trust from individual that we work with in the field the person you see on the right hand side be Paul DeLong Minutu he be one of the good communicator that I have really ever deal with when I arrive I do not speak a word of French and I still seem to understand what it be he be say Paul work for year on the Cameroonian national radio and television and he speak about health issue he be a health correspondent so we figure we have hire this person when we get there he could be a great communicator when we would get to this rural village though what we find out be that no one have television so they would not recognize he face but when he begin to speak they would actually recognize he voice from the radio and this be somebody who have incredible potential to spread aspect of we message whether it be with regards to wildlife conservation or health prevention often we run into obstacle this be we come back from one of this very rural site with specimen from 200 individual that we need to get back to the lab within 48 hour I like to show this shot this be Ubald Tamoufe who be the lead investigator in we Cameroon site Ubald laugh at I when I show this photo because of course you can not see he face but the reason I like to show the shot be because you can see that he be about to solve this problem laughter which which he do which he do just a few quick before and after shot this be we laboratory before this be what it look like now early on in order to ship we specimen we have to have dry ice to get dry ice we have to go to the brewery beg borrow steal to get this folk to give it to we now we have we own liquid nitrogen I like to call we laboratory the cold place in Central Africa it might be and here be a shot of I this be the before shot of I laughter no comment so what happen so during the 10 year that we have be do this work we actually surprise ourselves we make a number of discovery and what we have find be that if you look in the right place you can actually monitor the flow of this virus into human population that give we a tremendous amount of hope what we have find be a whole range of new virus in this individual include new virus in the same group as HIV so brand new retrovirus and let face it any new retrovirus in the human population it be something we should be aware of it be something we should be follow it be not something that we should be surprise by needless to say in the past this virus enter into this rural community might very well have go extinct that be no long the case log road provide access to urban area and critically what happen in central Africa do not stay in Central Africa so once we discover that it be really possible that we could actually do this monitoring we decide to move this from research to really attempt to phase up to a global monitoring effort through generous support and partnership scientifically with Google org and the Skoll Foundation we be able to start the global viral forecasting Initiative and begin work in four different site in Africa and Asia needless to say different population from different part of the world have different sort of contact so it be not just hunter in Central Africa it be also work in live animal market this wet market which be exactly the place where SARS emerge in Asia but really this be just the beginning from we perspective we objective right now in addition to deploy to this site and get everything move be to identify new partner because we feel like this effort need to be extend to probably 20 or more site throughout the world to viral hotspot because really the idea here be to cast a incredibly wide net so that we can catch this thing ideally before they make it to blood bank sexual network airplane and that be really we objective there be a time not very long ago when the discovery of unknown organism be something that hold incredible awe for we it have potential to really change the way that we see ourselves and think about ourselves many person I think on we planet right now despair and they think we have reach a point where we have discover most of the thing I be go tell you right now please do not despair if a intelligent extra terrestrial be tax with write the encyclopedia of life on we planet 27 out of 30 of this volume would be devote to bacterium and virus with just a few of the volume leave for plant fungus and animal human be a footnote interesting footnote but a footnote nonetheless this be honestly the most exciting period ever for the study of unknown life form on we planet the dominant thing that exist here we know almost nothing about and yet finally we have the tool which will allow we to actually explore that world and understand they thank you very much applause
