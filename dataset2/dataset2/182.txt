I be go to talk about two story today one be how we need to use market base pricing to affect demand and use wireless technology to dramatically reduce we emission in the transportation sector and the other be that there be a incredible opportunity if we choose the right wireless technology how we can generate a new engine for economic growth and dramatically reduce c02 in the other sector I be really scared we need to reduce c02 emission in ten to fifteen year by 80 percent in order to avert catastrophic effect and I be astounded that I be stand here to tell you that what be catastrophic effect a three degree centigrade climate change rise that will result in 50 percent species extinction it be not a movie this be real life and I be really worried because when person talk about car which I know something about the press and politician and person in this room be all think let use fuel efficient car if we start today 10 year from now at the end of this window of opportunity that fuel efficient car will reduce we fossil fuel need by four percent that be not enough but now I will talk about some more pleasant thing here be some way that we can make some dramatic change so Zipcar be a company that I find seven year ago but it be a example of something call car share what Zipcar do be we park car throughout dense urban area for member to reserve by the hour and by the day instead of use they own car how do it feel to be a person use a Zipcar it mean that I pay only for what I need all that hour when a car be sit idle I be not pay for it it mean that I can choose a car exactly for that particular trip so here be a woman that reserve MiniMia and she have she day I can take a BMW when I be see client I can drive my Toyota element when I be go to go on that surfing trip and the other remarkable thing be it be I think the high status of car ownership not only do I have a fleet of car available to I in seven city around the world that I can have at my beck and call but heaven forbid I would ever maintain or deal with the repair or have anything to do with it it be like the car that you always want that you mom say that you could not have I get all the good stuff and none of the bad so what be the social result of this the social result be that today Zipcar have 100 000 member drive 3 000 car park in 3 000 parking space instead of drive 12 000 mile a year which be what the average city dweller do they drive 500 mile a year be they happy the company have be double in size ever since I find it or great person adore the company and it be good you know they like it so how be it that person go from the 12 000 mile a year to 500 mile it be because they say it be eight to 10 dollar a hour and 65 dollar a day if I be go to go buy some ice cream do I really want to spend eight dollar to go buy the ice cream or maybe I will do without maybe I would have buy the ice cream when I do some other errand so person really respond very quickly to it to price and the last point I want to make be Zipcar would never be possible without technology it require that it be completely trivial that it take 30 second to reserve a car go get it drive it and for I as a service provider I would never be able to provide you a car for a hour if the transaction cost be anything so without this wireless technology this as a concept could never happen so here be another example this company be GoLoco I be launch it in about three week and I hope to do for rideshare what I do for car share this will apply to person across all of America Today 75 percent of the trip be single occupancy vehicle yet 12 percent of trip to work be currently carpool and I think that we can apply social network and online payment system to completely change how person feel about rideshare and make that trip much more efficient and so when I think about the future person will be think that share the ride with someone be this incredibly great social event out of they day you know how do you get to TED you go with other tedster how fabulous why would you ever want to go by yourself in you own car how do you go food shopping you go with you neighbor what a great social time you know it be go to really transform how we feel about travel and it will also I think enhance we freedom of mobility where can I go today and who can I do it with that be the type of thing that you will look at and feel and the social benefit the rate of single occupancy vehicle be I tell you 75 percent I think we can get that down to 50 percent the demand for parking of course be down congestion and the co2 emission one last piece about this of course be that it be enable by wireless technology and it be the cost of drive that be make person want to be able to do this the average American spend 19 percent of they income on they car and there be a pressure for they to reduce that cost yet they have no outlet today so the last example of this be congestion pricing very famously do in London it be when you charge a premium for person to drive on congested road in London the day they turn the congestion pricing on there be a 25 percent decrease in congestion overnight and that be persist for the four year in which they have be do congestion pricing and again do person like the outcome Ken Livingstone be reelect so again we can see that price play a enormous role in person willingness to reduce they drive behavior we have triple the mile that we drive since 1970 and double they since 1982 there be a huge slack in that system with the right pricing we can undo that congestion pricing be be discuss in every major city around the world and be again wirelessly enable you be not go to put tollbooth around the city of London and open and shut that gate and what congestion pricing be be that it be a technology trial and a psychological trial for something call road pricing and road pricing be where we be all go to have to go because today we pay for we maintenance and wear and tear on we car with gas tax and as we get we car more fuel efficient that be go to be reduce the amount of revenue that you get off of that gas tax so we need to charge person by the mile that they drive whatever happen with congestion pricing and that technology will be happen with road pricing why do we travel too much car travel be underpriced and therefore we over consume we need to put this good market feedback and if we have it you will decide how many mile to drive what mode of travel where to live and work and wireless technology make this real time loop possible so I want to move now to the second part of my story which be when be we go to start do this congestion pricing Road pricing be come when be we go to do it be we go to wait 10 to 15 year for this to happen or be we go to finally have this political will to make it happen in the next two year because I be go to say that be go to be the tool that be go to turn we usage overnight and what kind of wireless technology be we go to use this be my big vision there be a tool that can help we bridge the digital divide respond to emergency get traffic move provide a new engine for economic growth and dramatically reduce co2 emission in every sector and this be a moment from the graduate do you remember this moment you guy be go to be the handsome young guy and I be go to be the wise businessman I want to say one word to you just one word yes sir be you listen yes I be ad hoc peer to peer self configure wireless network laughter this be also call mesh network and in a mesh every device contribute to and expand the network and I think you might have hear a little bit about it before I be go to give you some example you will be hear later today from Alan Kay this laptop when a child open they up they communicate with every single child in the classroom within that school within that village and what be the cost of that communication system zero dollar a month here be another example in New Orleans video camera be mesh enable so that they could monitor crime in the downtown French quarter when the hurricane happen the only communication system stand be the mesh network volunteer fly in add a whole bunch of device and for the next 12 month mesh network be the only wireless that be happen in New Orleans another example be in Portsmouth U K they mesh enable 300 bus and they speak to this smart terminal you can look at the terminal and be able to see precisely where you bus be on the street and when it be come and you can buy you ticket in real time again all mesh enable monthly communication cost zero so the beauty of mesh network you can have this very low cost device zero ongoing communication cost highly scalable you can just keep add they and as in Katrina you can keep subtract they as long as there be some we can still communicate they be resilient they redundancy be build into this fabulous decentralized design what be the incredible weakness there be not anybody in Washington lobby to make it happen or in that municipality to build out they city with this wireless network because there be zero ongoing communication cost so the example that I give you be this island of mesh network and network be interesting only as they be big how do we create a big network be you guy ready again the graduate this time you will still play the handsome young thing but I will be the sexy woman this be the next two line in the movie where do you do it in he car so you know when you stick this idea laughter where would we expect I Robin Chase to be think be imagine if we put a mesh network device in every single car across America we could have a coast to coast free wireless communication system I guess I just want you to think about that and why be this go to happen because we be go to do congestion pricing we be go to do road toll gas tax be go to become road pricing this thing be go to happen what be the wireless technology we be go to use maybe we should use a good one when be we go to do it maybe we should not wait for the 10 or 15 year for this to happen we should pull it forward so I would like we to launch the wireless internet interstate wireless mesh system and require that this network be accessible to everyone with open standard right now in the transportation sector we be create this wireless device I guess you guy might have fast pass here or Easy Lane that be single purpose device in this closed network what be the point we be transfer just a few little datum bit when we be do road control road pricing we have this incredible excess capacity so we can provide the low cost means of go wireless coast to coast we can have resilient nationwide communication system we have a new tool for create efficiency in all sector imagine what happen when the cost of get information from anywhere to anywhere be close to zero what you can do with that tool we can create a economic engine information should be free and access to information should be free and we should be charge person for carbon I think this be a more powerful tool than the Interstate Highway Act and I think this be as important and world change to we economy as electrification and if I have my druther we would have a open source version in addition to open standard and this open source version mean that it could be if we do a brilliant job of it it could be use around the world very quickly so go back to one of my early thought imagine if every one of this bus in Lagos be part of the mesh network when I go this morning to Larry Brilliant tedtalk prize he fabulous network imagine if there be a open source mesh communication device that can be put into that network to make all that happen and we can be do it if we could just get over the fact that this little slice of thing be go to be for free we could make billion of dollar on top of it but this one particular slice of communication need to be open source so let take control of this nightmare implement a gas tax immediately transition across the nation to road tolling with this wireless mesh require that the mesh be open to all with open standard and of course use mesh network thank you applause
