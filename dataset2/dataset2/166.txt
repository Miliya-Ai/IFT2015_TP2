you know I be strike by how one of the implicit theme of TED be compassion this very moving demonstration we have just see HIV in Africa President Clinton last night and I would like to do a little collateral thinking if you will about compassion and bring it from the global level to the personal I be a psychologist but rest assure I will not bring it to the scrotal laughter there be a very important study do a while ago at Princeton Theological Seminary that speak to why it be that when all of we have so many opportunity to help we do sometimes and we do not other time a group of divinity student at the Princeton Theological Seminary be tell that they be go to give a practice sermon and they be each give a sermon topic half of that student be give as a topic the parable of the good Samaritan the man who stop the stranger in to help the stranger in need by the side of the road half be give random Bible topic then one by one they be tell they have to go to another building and give they sermon as they go from the first building to the second each of they pass a man who be bent over and moan clearly in need the question be do they stop to help the more interesting question be do it matter they be contemplate the parable of the good Samaritan answer no not at all what turn out to determine whether someone would stop and help a stranger in need be how much of a hurry they think they be in be they feel they be late or be they absorb in what they be go to talk about and this be I think the predicament of we life that we do not take every opportunity to help because we focus be in the wrong direction there be a new field in brain science social neuroscience this study the circuitry in two person brain that activate while they interact and the new thinking about compassion from social neuroscience be that we default wiring be to help that be to say if we attend to the other person we automatically empathize we automatically feel with they there be this newly identify neuron mirror neuron that act like a neuro Wi Fi activate in we brain exactly the area activate in theirs we feel with automatically and if that person be in need if that person be suffer we be automatically prepare to help at least that be the argument but then the question be why do not we and I think this speak to a spectrum that go from complete self absorption to notice to empathy and to compassion and the simple fact be if we be focus on ourselves if we be preoccupy as we so often be throughout the day we do not really fully notice the other and this difference between the self and the other focus can be very subtle I be do my tax the other day and I get to the point where I be list all of the donation I give and I have a epiphany it be I come to my check to the Seva Foundation and I notice that I think boy my friend Larry Brilliant would really be happy that I give money to Seva then I realize that what I be get from give be a narcissistic hit that I feel good about myself then I start to think about the person in the Himalayas whose cataract would be help and I realize that I go from this kind of narcissistic self focus to altruistic joy to feel good for the person that be be help I think that be a motivator but this distinction between focus on ourselves and focus on other be one that I encourage we all to pay attention to you can see it at a gross level in the world of dating I be at a sushi restaurant a while back and I overhear two woman talk about the brother of one woman who be in the singles scene and this woman say my brother be have trouble get date so he be try speed dating I do not know if you know speed dating woman sit at table and man go from table to table and there be a clock and a bell and at five minute bingo the conversation end and the woman can decide whether to give she card or she email address to the man for follow up and this woman say my brother never get a card and I know exactly why the moment he sit down he start talk non stop about himself he never ask about the woman and I be do some research in the Sunday Styles section of the New York Times look at the back story of marriage because they be very interesting and I come to the marriage of Alice Charney Epstein and she say that when she be in the dating scene she have a simple test she put person to the test be from the moment they get together how long it would take the guy to ask she a question with the word you in it and apparently Epstein ace the test therefore the article laughter now this be a it be a little test I encourage you to try out at a party here at TED there be great opportunity the Harvard Business Review recently have a article call the human moment about how to make real contact with a person at work and they say well the fundamental thing you have to do be turn off you blackberry close you laptop end you daydream and pay full attention to the person there be a newly coin word in the English language for the moment when the person we be with whip out they blackberry or answer that cell phone and all of a sudden we do not exist the word be pizzle it be a combination of puzzled and pissed off laughter I think it be quite apt it be we empathy it be we tuning in which separate we from Machiavellians or sociopath I have a brother in law who be a expert on horror and terror he write the annotated Dracula the essential Frankenstein he be train as a Chaucer scholar but he be bear in Transylvania and I think it affect he a little bit at any rate at one point my brother in law leonard decide to write a book about a serial killer this be a man who terrorize the very vicinity we be in many year ago he be know as the Santa Cruz strangler and before he be arrest he have murder he grandparent he mother and five co ed at UC Santa Cruz so my brother in law go to interview this killer and he realize when he meet he that this guy be absolutely terrifying for one thing he be almost seven foot tall but that be not the most terrifying thing about he the scary thing be that he iq be 160 a certified genius but there be zero correlation between IQ and emotional empathy feel with the other person they be control by different part of the brain so at one point my brother in law get up the courage to ask the one question he really want to know the answer to and that be how could you have do it do not you feel any pity for you victim this be very intimate murder he strangle he victim and the strangler say very matter of factly oh no if I have feel the distress I could not have do it I have to turn that part of I off I have to turn that part of I off and I think that that be very troubling and in a sense I have be reflect on turn that part of we off when we focus on ourselves in any activity we do turn that part of ourselves off if there be another person think about go shopping and think about the possibility of a compassionate consumerism right now as Bill McDonough have point out the object that we buy and use have hide consequence we be all unwitting victim of a collective blind spot we do not notice and do not notice that we do not notice the toxic molecule emit by a carpet or by the fabric on the seat or we do not know if that fabric be a technological or manufacture nutrient it can be reuse or do it just end up at landfill in other word we be oblivious to the ecological and public health and social and economic justice consequence of the thing we buy and use in a sense the room itself be the elephant in the room but we do not see it and we have become victim of a system that point we elsewhere consider this there be a wonderful book call Stuff the Hidden Life of Everyday Objects and it talk about the back story of something like a t shirt and it talk about where the cotton be grow and the fertilizer that be use and the consequence for soil of that fertilizer and it mention for instance that cotton be very resistant to textile dye about 60 percent wash off into wastewater and it be well know by epidemiologist that kid who live near textile work tend to have high rate of leukemia there be a company Bennett and Company that supply Polo com Victoria Secret they because of they ceo who be aware of this in China form a joint venture with they dye work to make sure that the wastewater would be properly take care of before it return to the groundwater right now we do not have the option to choose the virtuous t shirt over the non virtuous one so what would it take to do that well I have be think for one thing there be a new electronic tagging technology that allow any store to know the entire history of any item on the shelf in that store you can track it back to the factory once you can track it back to the factory you can look at the manufacturing process that be use to make it and if it be virtuous you can label it that way or if it be not so virtuous you can go into today go into any store put you scanner on a palm onto a barcode which will take you to a website they have it for person with allergy to peanut that website could tell you thing about that object in other word at point of purchase we might be able to make a compassionate choice there be a say in the world of information science ultimately everybody will know everything and the question be will it make a difference some time ago when I be work for the New York Times it be in the 80 I do a article on what be then a new problem in New York it be homeless person on the street and I spend a couple of week go around with a social work agency that minister to the homeless and I realize see the homeless through they eye that almost all of they be psychiatric patient that have nowhere to go they have a diagnosis it make I what it do be to shake I out of the urban trance where when we see when we be pass someone who be homeless in the periphery of we vision it stay on the periphery we do not notice and therefore we do not act one day soon after that it be a Friday at the end of the day I go down I be go down to the subway it be rush hour and thousand of person be stream down the stair and all of a sudden as I be go down the stair I notice that there be a man slump to the side shirtless not move and person be just step over he hundred and hundred of person and because my urban trance have be somehow weaken I find myself stop to find out what be wrong the moment I stop half a dozen other person immediately ring the same guy and we find out that he be Hispanic he do not speak any English he have no money he have be wander the street for day starve and he would faint from hunger immediately someone go to get orange juice someone bring a hotdog someone bring a subway cop this guy be back on he foot immediately but all it take be that simple act of notice and so I be optimistic thank you very much applause
