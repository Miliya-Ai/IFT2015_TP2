I write a letter last week talk about the work of the foundation share some of the problem and Warren Buffet have recommend I do that be honest about what be go well what be not and make it kind of a annual thing a goal I have there be to draw more person in to work on that problem because I think there be some very important problem that do not get work on naturally that be the market do not drive the scientist the communicator the thinker the government to do the right thing and only by pay attention to this thing and have brilliant person who care and draw other person in can we make as much progress as we need to so this morning I be go to share two of this problem and talk about where they stand but before I dive into that I want to admit that I be a optimist any tough problem I think it can be solve and part of the reason I feel that way be look at the past over the past century average lifespan have more than double another statistic perhaps my favorite be to look at childhood death as recently as 1960 110 million child be bear and 20 million of that die before the age of five five year ago 135 million child be bear so more and less than 10 million of they die before the age of five so that be a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate it be a phenomenal thing each one of that life matter a lot and the key reason we be able to it be not only rise income but also a few key breakthrough vaccine that be use more widely for example measles be four million of the death back as recently as 1990 and now be under 400 000 so we really can make change the next breakthrough be to cut that 10 million in half again and I think that be doable in well under 20 year why well there be only a few disease that account for the vast majority of that death diarrhea pneumonia and malaria so that bring we to the first problem that I will raise this morning which be how do we stop a deadly disease that be spread by mosquito well what be the history of this disease it be be a severe disease for thousand of year in fact if we look at the genetic code it be the only disease we can see that person who live in Africa actually evolve several thing to avoid malarial death death actually peak at a bit over five million in the 1930 so it be absolutely gigantic and the disease be all over the world a terrible disease it be in the United States it be in Europe People do not know what cause it until the early 1900 when a British military man figure out that it be mosquitos so it be everywhere and two tool help bring the death rate down one be kill the mosquito with DDT the other be treat the patient with quinine or quinine derivative and so that be why the death rate do come down now ironically what happen be it be eliminate from all the temperate zone which be where the rich country be so we can see 1900 it be everywhere 1945 it be still most place 1970 the U S and most of Europe have get rid of it 1990 you have get most of the northern area and more recently you can see it be just around the equator and so this lead to the paradox that because the disease be only in the poor country it do not get much investment for example there be more money put into baldness drug than be put into malaria now baldness it be a terrible thing laughter and rich man be afflict and so that be why that priority have be set but malaria even the million death a year cause by malaria greatly understate its impact over 200 million person at any one time be suffer from it it mean that you can not get the economy in this area go because it just hold thing back so much now malaria be of course transmit by mosquito I bring some here just so you could experience this we will let that roam around the auditorium a little bit laughter there be no reason only poor person should have the experience laughter applause that mosquito be not infect so we have come up with a few new thing we have get bed net and bed net be a great tool what it mean be the mother and child stay under the bed net at night so the mosquito that bite late at night can not get at they and when you use indoor spray with ddt and that net you can cut death by over 50 percent and that be happen now in a number of country it be great to see but we have to be careful because malaria the parasite evolve and the mosquito evolve so every tool that we have ever have in the past have eventually become ineffective and so you end up with two choice if you go into a country with the right tool and the right way you do it vigorously you can actually get a local eradication and that be where we see the malaria map shrink or if you go in kind of half heartedly for a period of time you will reduce the disease burden but eventually that tool will become ineffective and the death rate will soar back up again and the world have go through this where it pay attention and then do not pay attention now we be on the upswing Bed net funding be up there be new drug discovery go on we foundation have back a vaccine that be go into phase three trial that start in a couple month and that should save over two third of the life if it be effective so we be go to have this new tool but that alone do not give we the road map because the road map to get rid of this disease involve many thing it involve communicator to keep the funding high to keep the visibility high to tell the success story it involve social scientist so we know how to get not just 70 percent of the person to use the bed net but 90 percent we need mathematician to come in and simulate this to do Monte Carlo thing to understand how this tool combine and work together of course we need drug company to give we they expertise we need rich world government to be very generous in provide aid for this thing and so as this element come together I be quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria now let I turn to a second question a fairly different question but I would say equally important and this be how do you make a teacher great it seem like the kind of question that person would spend a lot of time on and we would understand very well and the answer be really that we do not let start with why this be important well all of we here I will bet have some great teacher we all have a wonderful education that be part of the reason we be here today part of the reason we be successful I can say that even though I be a college drop out I have great teacher in fact in the United States the teaching system have work fairly well there be fairly effective teacher in a narrow set of place so the top 20 percent of student have get a good education and that top 20 percent have be the good in the world if you measure they against the other top 20 percent and they have go on to create the revolution in software and biotechnology and keep the U S at the forefront now the strength for that top 20 percent be start to fade on a relative basis but even more concern be the education that the balance of person be get not only have that be weak it be get weak and if you look at the economy it really be only provide opportunity now to person with a good education and we have to change this we have to change it so that person have equal opportunity we have to change it so that the country be strong and stay at the forefront of thing that be drive by advanced education like science and mathematics when I first learn the statistics I be pretty stunned at how bad thing be over 30 percent of kid never finish high school and that have be cover up for a long time because they always take the dropout rate as the number who start in senior year and compare it to the number who finish senior year because they be not track where the kid be before that but most of the dropout have take place before that they have to raise the state dropout rate as soon as that tracking be do to over 30 percent for minority kid it be over 50 percent and even if you graduate from high school if you be low income you have less than a 25 percent chance of ever complete a college degree if you be low income in the United States you have a high chance of go to jail than you do of get a four year degree and that do not seem entirely fair so how do you make education well now we foundation for the last nine year have invest in this there be many person work on it we have work on small school we have fund scholarship we have do thing in library a lot of this thing have a good effect but the more we look at it the more we realize that have great teacher be the very key thing and we hook up with some person study how much variation be there between teacher between say the top quartile the very good and the bottom quartile how much variation be there within a school or between school and the answer be that this variation be absolutely unbelievable a top quartile teacher will increase the performance of they class base on test score by over 10 percent in a single year what do that mean that mean that if the entire u s for two year have top quartile teacher the entire difference between we and Asia would go away within four year we would be blow everyone in the world away so it be simple all you need be that top quartile teacher and so you would say wow we should reward that person we should retain that person we should find out what they be do and transfer that skill to other person but I can tell you that absolutely be not happen today what be the characteristic of this top quartile what do they look like you might think this must be very senior teacher and the answer be no once somebody have teach for three year they teaching quality do not change thereafter the variation be very very small you might think this be person with master degree they have go back and they have get they Master of Education this chart take four different factor and say how much do they explain teach quality that bottom thing which say there be no effect at all be a master degree now the way the pay system work be there be two thing that be reward one be seniority because you pay go up and you vest into you pension the second be give extra money to person who get they master degree but it in no way be associate with be a good teacher teach for America slight effect for math teacher major in math there be a measurable effect but overwhelmingly it be you past performance there be some person who be very good at this and we have do almost nothing to study what that be and to draw it in and to replicate it to raise the average capability or to encourage the person with it to stay in the system you might say do the good teacher stay and the bad teacher leave the answer be on average the slightly good teacher leave the system and it be a system with very high turnover now there be a few place very few where great teacher be be make a good example of one be a set of charter school call KIPP KIPP mean knowledge be power it be a unbelievable thing they have 66 school mostly middle school some high school and what go on be great teaching they take the poor kid and over 96 percent of they high school graduate go to four year college and the whole spirit and attitude in that school be very different than in the normal public school they be team teaching they be constantly improve they teacher they be take datum the test score and say to a teacher hey you cause this amount of increase they be deeply engage in make teach good when you actually go and sit in one of this classroom at first it be very bizarre I sit down and I think what be go on the teacher be run around and the energy level be high I think I be in the sport rally or something what be go on and the teacher be constantly scan to see which kid be not pay attention which kid be bored and call kid rapidly put thing up on the board it be a very dynamic environment because particularly in that middle school year fifth through eighth grade keep person engage and set the tone that everybody in the classroom need to pay attention nobody get to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who do not want to be there everybody need to be involve and so KIPP be do it how do that compare to a normal school well in a normal school teacher be not tell how good they be the datum be not gather in the teacher contract it will limit the number of time the principal can come into the classroom sometimes to once per year and they need advanced notice to do that so imagine run a factory where you have get this worker some of they just make crap and the management be tell hey you can only come down here once a year but you need to let we know because we might actually fool you and try and do a good job in that one brief moment even a teacher who want to improve do not have the tool to do it they do not have the test score and there be a whole thing of try to block the datum for example New York pass a law that say that the teacher improvement datum could not be make available and use in the tenure decision for the teacher and so that be sort of work in the opposite direction but I be optimistic about this I think there be some clear thing we can do First of all there be a lot more testing go on and that be give we the picture of where we be and that allow we to understand who be do it well and call they out and find out what that technique be of course digital video be cheap now put a few camera in the classroom and say that thing be be record on a ongoing basis be very practical in all public school and so every few week teacher could sit down and say ok here be a little clip of something I think I do well here be a little clip of something I think I do poorly advise I when this kid act up how should I have deal with that and they could all sit and work together on that problem you can take the very good teacher and kind of annotate it have it so everyone see who be the very good at teaching this stuff you can take that great course and make they available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course learn from that if you have a kid who be behind you would know you could assign they that video to watch and review the concept and in fact this free course could not only be available just on the internet but you could make it so that dvd be always available and so anybody who have access to a dvd player can have the very good teacher and so by think of this as a personnel system we can do it much well now there be a book actually about KIPP the place that this be go on that Jay Matthews a news reporter write call Work Hard be nice and I think it be so fantastic it give you a sense of what a good teacher do I be go to send everyone here a free copy of this book applause now we put a lot of money into education and I really think that education be the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a future as it should have in fact we have in the stimulus bill it be interesting the House version actually have money in it for this datum system and it be take out in the Senate because there be person who be threaten by this thing but I I be optimistic I think person be begin to recognize how important this be and it really can make a difference for million of life if we get it right I only have time to frame that two problem there be a lot more problem like that AIDS pneumonia I can just see you be get excited just at the very name of this thing and the skill set require to tackle this thing be very broad you know the system do not naturally make it happen government do not naturally pick this thing in the right way the private sector do not naturally put its resource into this thing so it be go to take brilliant person like you to study this thing get other person involved and you be help to come up with solution and with that I think there be some great thing that will come out of it thank you applause
