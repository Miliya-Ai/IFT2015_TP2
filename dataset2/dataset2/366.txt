what be happen in genomic and how this revolution be about to change everything we know about the world life ourselves and how we think about they if you see 2001 a space odyssey and you hear the boom boom boom boom and you see the monolith you know that be Arthur C Clarke representation that we be at a seminal moment in the evolution of we species in this case it be pick up bone and create a tool use it as a tool which mean that ape just sort of run around and eat and do each other figure out they can make thing if they use a tool and that move we to the next level and you know we in the last 30 year in particular have see this acceleration in knowledge and technology and technology have breed more knowledge and give we tool and we have see many seminal moment we have see the creation of small computer in the 70 and early 80 and who would have think back then that every single person would not have just one computer but probably 20 in you home and in not just you p c but in every device in you washing machine you cell phone you be walk around you car have 12 microprocessor then we go along and create the internet and connect the world together we flatten the world we have see so much change and we have give ourselves this tool now this high power tool that be allow we to turn the lens inward into something that be common to all of we and that be a genome how you genome today have you think about it lately hear about it at least you probably hear about genome this day I think I would take a moment to tell you what a genome be it be sort of like if you ask person well what be a megabyte or megabit and what be broadband person never want to say I really do not understand so I will tell you right off of the bat you have hear of dna you probably study a little bit in biology a genome be really a description for all of the dna that be in a live organism and one thing that be common to all of life be dna it do not matter whether you be a yeast it do not matter whether you be a mouse do not matter whether you be a fly we all have dna the dna be organize in word call they gene and chromosome and when Watson and Crick in the 50 first decode this beautiful double helix that we know as the dna molecule very long complicated molecule we then start on this journey to understand that inside of that dna be a language that determine the characteristic we trait what we inherit what disease we may get we have also along the way discover that this be a very old molecule that all of the dna in you body have be around forever since the beginning of we of we as creature there be a historical archive live in you genome be the history of we species and you as a individual human being where you be from go back thousand and thousand and thousand of year and that be now start to be understand but also the genome be really the instruction manual it be the program it be the code of life it be what make you function it be what make every organism function dna be a very elegant molecule it be long and it be complicated really all you have to know about it be that there be four letter a t c g they represent the name of a chemical and with this four letter you can create a language a language that can describe anything and very complicated thing you know they be generally put together in pair create a word or what we call base pair and you would you know when you think about it four letter or the representation of four thing make we work and that may not sound very intuitive but let I flip over to something else you know about and that be computer look at this screen here and you know you see picture and you see word but really all there be be one and zero the language of technology be binary you have probably hear that at some point in time everything that happen in digital be convert or a representation of a one and a zero so when you be listen to iTunes and you favorite music that be really just a bunch of one and zero play very quickly when you be see this picture it be all one and zero and when you be talk on you telephone you cell phone and it be go over the network you voice be all be turn into one and zero and magically whiz around and look at all the complex thing and wonderful thing we have be able to create with just a one and a zero well now you ramp that up to four and you have a lot of complexity a lot of way to describe mechanism so let talk about what that mean so if you look at a human genome they consist of 3 2 billion of this base pair that be a lot and they mix up in all different fashion and that make you a human being if you convert that to binary just to give you a little bit of size we be actually small than the program Microsoft Office it be not really all that much datum I will also tell you we be at least as buggy laughter this here be a bug in my genome that I have struggle with for a long long time when you get sick it be a bug in you genome in fact many many disease we have struggle with for a long time like cancer we have not be able to cure because we just do not understand how it work at the genomic level we be start to understand that so up to this point we try to fix it by use what I call shit against the wall pharmacology which mean well let just throw chemical at it and maybe it be go to make it work but if you really understand why do a cell go from normal cell to cancer what be the code what be the exact instruction that be make it do that then you can go about the process of try to fix it and figure it out so for you next dinner over a great bottle of wine here be a few factoid for you we actually have about 24 000 gene that do thing we have about a hundred 120 000 other that do not appear to function every day but represent this archival history of how we use to work as a species go back ten of thousand of year you might also be interested in know that a mouse have about the same amount of gene they recently sequence Pinot noir and it also have about 30 000 gene so the number of gene you have may not necessarily represent the complexity or the evolutionary order of any particular species now look around just look next to you neighbor look forward look backward we all look pretty different a lot of very handsome and pretty person here skinny chubby different race culture we be all 99 9 genetically equal it be one one hundredth of one percent of genetic material that make the difference between any one of we that be a tiny amount of material but the way that ultimately express itself be what make change in human and in all species so we be now able to read genome the first human genome take 10 year three billion dollar it be do by Dr Craig Venter and then James Watson one of the co founder of dna genome be do for two million dollar and in just two month and if you think about the computer industry and how we have go from big computer to little one and how they get more powerful and fast all the time the same thing be happen with gene sequencing now we be on the cusp of be able to sequence human genome for about 5 000 dollar in about a hour or a half hour you will see that happen in the next five year and what that mean be you be go to walk around with you own personal genome on a smart card it will be here and when you buy medicine you will not be buy a drug that be use for everybody you will give you genome to the pharmacist and you drug will be make for you and it will work much good than the one that be you will not have side effect all that side effect you know oily residue and you know whatever they say in that commercial forget about that they be go to make all that stuff go away what do a genome look like well there it be it be a long long series of this base pair if you see the genome for a mouse or for a human it would look no different than this but what scientist be do now be they be understand what this do and what they mean because what Nature be do be double click all the time in other word the first couple of sentence here assume this be a grape plant make a root make a branch create a blossom in a human be down in here it could be make blood cell start cancer for I it may be every calorie you consume you conserve because I come from a very cold climate for my wife eat three time as much and you never put on any weight it be all hide in this code and it be start to be understand at breakneck pace so what can we do with genome now that we can read they now that we be start to have the book of life well there be many thing some be exciting some person will find very scary I will tell you a couple of thing that will probably make you want to projectile puke on I but that be okay so you know we now can learn the history of organism you can do a very simple test scrape you cheek send it off you can find out where you relative come from you can do you genealogy go back thousand of year we can understand functionality this be really important we can understand for example why we create plaque in we artery what create the starchiness inside of a grain why do yeast metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide we can also look at at a grand scale what create problem what create disease and how we may be able to fix they because we can understand this we can fix they make good organism most importantly what we be learn be that Nature have provide we a spectacular toolbox the toolbox exist a architect far good and smart than we have give we that toolbox and we now have the ability to use it we be now not just read genome we be write they this company Synthetic Genomics I be involve with create the first full synthetic genome for a little bug a very primitive creature call Mycoplasma genitalium if you have a uti you have probably or ever have a uti you have come in contact with this little bug very simple only have about 246 gene but we be able to completely synthesize that genome now you have the genome and you say to yourself so if I plug this synthetic genome if I pull the old one out and plug it in do it just boot up and live well guess what it do not only do it do that if you take the genome that synthetic genome and you plug it into a different critter like yeast you now turn that yeast into Mycoplasma it be sort of like boot up a pc with a Mac O s software well actually you could do it the other way so you know by be able to write a genome and plug it into a organism the software if you will change the hardware and this be extremely profound so last year the French and Italian announce they get together and they go ahead and they sequence Pinot noir the genomic sequence now exist for the entire Pinot noir organism and they identify once again about 29 000 gene they have discover pathway that create flavor although it be very important to understand that that compound that it be crank out have to match a receptor in we genome in we tongue for we to understand and interpret that flavor they have also discover that there be a heck of a lot of activity go on produce aroma as well they have identify area of vulnerability to disease they now be understand and the work be go on exactly how this plant work and we have the capability to know to read that entire code and understand how it tick so then what do you do know that we can read it know that we can write it change it maybe write its genome from scratch so what do you do well one thing you could do be what some person might call Franken noir laughter we can build a good vine by the way just so you know you get stress out about genetically modify organism there be not one single vine in this valley or anywhere that be not genetically modify they be not grow from seed they be graft into root stock they would not exist in nature on they own so do not worry about do not stress about that stuff we have be do this forever so we could you know focus on disease resistance we can go for high yield without necessarily have dramatic farming technique to do it or cost we could conceivably expand the climate window we could make Pinot noir grow maybe in Long Island God forbid laughter we could produce good flavor and aroma you want a little more raspberry a little more chocolate here or there all of this thing could conceivably be do and I will tell you I would pretty much bet that it will be do but there be a ecosystem here in other word we be not sort of unique little organism run around we be part of a big ecosystem in fact I be sorry to inform you that inside of you digestive tract be about 10 pound of microbe which you be circulate through you body quite a bit we ocean team with microbe in fact when Craig Venter go and sequence the microbe in the ocean in the first three month triple the known species on the planet by discover all new microbe in the first 20 foot of water we now understand that that microbe have more impact on we climate and regulate co2 and oxygen than plant do which we always think oxygenate the atmosphere we find microbial life in every part of the planet in ice in coal in rock in volcanic vent it be a amazing thing but we have also discover when it come to plant in plant as much as we understand and be start to understand they genome it be the ecosystem around they it be the microbe that live in they root system that have just as much impact on the character of that plant as the metabolic pathway of the plant themselves if you take a close look at a root system you will find there be many many many diverse microbial colony this be not big news to viticulturist they have be you know concern with water and fertilization and again this be sort of my notion of shit against the wall pharmacology you know certain fertilizer make the plant more healthy so you put more in you do not necessarily know with granularity exactly what organism be provide what flavor and what characteristic we can start to figure that out we all talk about terroir we worship terroir we say wow be my terroir great it be so special I have get this piece of land and it create terroir like you would not believe well you know we really we argue and debate about it we say it be climate it be soil it be this well guess what we can figure out what the heck terroir be it be in there wait to be sequence there be thousand of microbe there they be easy to sequence unlike a human they you know have a thousand two thousand gene we can figure out what they be all we have to do be go around and sample dig into the ground find that bug sequence they correlate they to the kind of characteristic we like and do not like that be just a big database and then fertilize and then we understand what be terroir so some person will say oh my God be we play God be we now if we engineer organism be we play God and you know person would always ask James Watson he be not always the most politically correct guy laughter and they would say be you know be you play God and he have the good answer I ever hear to this question well somebody have to laughter I consider myself a very spiritual person and without you know the organized religion part and I will tell you I do not believe there be anything unnatural I do not believe that chemical be unnatural I tell you I be go to make some of you puke it be very simple we do not invent molecule compound they be here they be in the universe we reorganize thing we change they around but we do not make anything unnatural now we can create bad impact we can poison ourselves we can poison the Earth but that be just a natural outcome of a mistake we make so what be happen today be Nature be present we with a toolbox and we find that this toolbox be very extensive there be microbe out there that actually make gasoline believe it or not there be microbe you know go back to yeast this be chemical factory the most sophisticated chemical factory be provide by Nature and we now can use that there also be a set of rule Nature will not allow you to we could engineer a grape plant but guess what we can not make the grape plant produce baby Nature have put a set of rule out there we can work within the rule we can not break the rule we be just learn what the rule be I just ask the question if you could cure all disease if you could make disease go away because we understand how it actually work if we could end hunger by be able to create nutritious healthy plant that grow in very hard to grow environment if we could create clean and plentiful energy we right in the lab at Synthetic Genomics have single cell organism that be take carbon dioxide and produce a molecule very similar to gasoline so carbon dioxide the stuff we want to get rid of not sugar not anything Carbon dioxide a little bit of sunlight you end up with a lipid that be highly refined we could solve we energy problem we can reduce co2 we could clean up we ocean we could make good wine if we could would we well you know I think the answer be very simple work with Nature work with this tool set that we now understand be the next step in humankind evolution and all I can tell you be stay healthy for 20 year if you can stay healthy for 20 year you will see 150 maybe 300 thank you
