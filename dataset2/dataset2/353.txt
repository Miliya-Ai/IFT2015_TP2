there be more Chinese restaurant in this country than McDonald Burger King Kentucky Fried Chicken and Wendy combine 40 000 actually Chinese restaurant have play a important role in American history as a matter of fact the Cuban missile crisis be resolve in a Chinese restaurant call Yenching Palace in Washington DC which unfortunately be close now and about to be turn into Walgreen and the house where John Wilkes Booth plan the assassination of Abraham Lincoln be also now a Chinese restaurant call wok and roll on H Street in Washington laughter and it be not completely gratuitous because wok and roll Chinese food and Japanese food so it kind of work out and American love they Chinese food so much they have actually bring it into space NASA for example serve thermostabilize sweet and sour pork on its shuttle menu for its astronaut so let I present the question to you if we benchmark for americanness be apple pie you should ask yourself how often do you eat apple pie versus how often do you eat Chinese food laughter and if you think about it a lot of the food that we or American think of as Chinese food be barely recognizable to Chinese for example beef with broccoli egg roll General Tso Chicken fortune cookie chop suey the take out box for example I take a whole bunch of fortune cookie back to China give they to Chinese to see how they would react what be this should I try it try it what be this call Fortune cookie laughter there be a piece of paper inside laughter what be this you have win a prize what be this it be a fortune tasty so where be they from the short answer be actually they be from Japan and in Kyoto outside there be still small family run bakery that make fortune cookie as they do over 100 year ago 30 year before fortune cookie be introduce in the United States if you see they side by side there be yellow and brown theirs be actually flavor with miso and sesame paste so they be not as sweet as we version so how do they get to the US well the short answer be the Japanese immigrant come over and a bunch of the baker introduce they include at least one in Los Angeles and one here in San Francisco call Benkyodo which be on the corner of Sutter and Buchanan back then they make fortune cookie use very much the similar kind of iron that we see back in Kyoto the interesting question be how do you go from fortune cookie be something that be Japanese to be something that be Chinese well we lock up all the Japanese during World War II include that that make fortune cookie so that be when the Chinese move in see a market opportunity and take over laughter so fortune cookie invent by the Japanese popularize by the Chinese but ultimately consume by American they be more American than anything else another of my favorite dish General Tso chicken which by the way in the US Naval Academy be call Admiral Tso chicken laughter I love this dish the original name of my book be the long March of General Tso and he have march very far indeed because he be sweet he be fry and he be chicken all thing that American love laughter he have march so far actually that the chef who originally invent the dish do not recognize it he be kind of horrified video in Chinese audience laughter he be in Taiwan right now he be retire deaf and play a lot of mah jongg after I show he this he get up and say m m ngq mi o which mean this be all nonsense and go back to play he mah jongg game during the afternoon another dish one of my favorite beef with broccoli broccoli be not a Chinese vegetable in fact it be originally a Italian vegetable it be introduce into the United States in the 1800 but become popularize in the 1920 and the 1930 the Chinese have they own version of broccoli call Chinese broccoli but they have now discover American broccoli and be import it as a sort of exotic delicacy I guarantee you General Tso never see a stalk of broccoli in he life that be a picture of General Tso I go to he home town this be a billboard that say welcome to the birthplace of General Tso and I go look for chicken finally find a cow and do find chicken believe it or not this guy be actually cross the road laughter and I find a whole bunch of General Tso relative who be still in the town this guy be now five generation remove from the General this guy be about seven I show they the picture of General Tso Chicken and they be like we do not know this dish be this Chinese food because it do not look like Chinese food to they but they be not surprised I travel around the world to visit they because in they eye he be after all a famous Qing dynasty military hero he play a important role in the Taiping Rebellion a war start by a guy who think he be the son of God and baby brother of Jesus Christ he cause a war that kill 20 million person still the deadly civil war in the world to this day so you know I realize when I be there general tso be kind of a lot like Colonel Sanders in America in that he be know for chicken and not war but in China this guy actually know for war and not chicken but the granddaddy of all the Chinese American dish we probably ought to talk about be chop suey which be introduce around the turn of the 20th century accord to the New York Times in 1904 there be a outbreak of Chinese restaurant all over town and the city have go chop suey mad so it take about 30 year before the American realize that chop suey be actually not know in China and as this article point out the average native of any city in China know nothing of chop suey back then it be a way to show you be sophisticated and cosmopolitan a guy who want to impress a girl could take she on a chop suey date I like to say chop suey be the big culinary joke one culture ever play on another because chop suey translate into Chinese means jaahp seui which translate back mean odds and end so this person be go around China ask for chop suey which be sort of like a Japanese guy come here and say I understand you have a very popular dish in you country call leftovers laughter right laughter and not only that this dish be particularly popular after that holiday you call Thanksgiving laughter so why and where do chop suey come from Let go back to the mid 1800 when the Chinese first come to America back then American be not clamoring to eat Chinese food in fact they see this person who land at they shore as alien this person be not eat dog they be eat cat if they be not eat cat they be eat rat in fact the New York Times my esteemed employer in 1883 run a article that ask do Chinese eat rat not the most pc question to be ask today but if you look at the popular imagery of the time not so outlandish this be actually a real advertisement for rat poison from the late 1800 and if you see under the word clear very small it say they must go which refer not only to the rat but to the Chinese in they midst because the way that the food be perceive be that this person who eat food different from we must be different from we another way that you see this antipathy towards the Chinese be through document like this this be in the Library of Congress it be a pamphlet publish by Samuel Gompers hero of we American labor movement it be call some reason for Chinese exclusion meat versus Rice American Manhood against Asiatic Coolieism which shall survive and it basically make the argument that Chinese man who eat rice would necessarily bring down the standard of live for American man who eat meat and as a matter of fact then this be one of the reason we must exclude they from this country so with sentiment like this the Chinese Exclusion Act be pass between 1882 and 1902 the only time in American history when a group be specifically exclude for its national origin or ethnicity so in a way because the Chinese be attack chop suey be create as a defense mechanism who come up with the idea of chop suey there be a lot of different mystery and legend but of the one I have find the most interesting be this article from 1904 a Chinese guy name Lem Sen show up in Chinatown New York City and say I want you all to stop make chop suey because I be the original creator and sole proprietor of chop suey and the way he tell it there be a famous Chinese diplomat that show up and he be tell to make a dish that look very popular and could quote pass as Chinese and as he say we would never print this today but basically the American man have become very rich Lem Sen I would have make this money too but I spend all this time look for the American man who steal my recipe now I have find he and I want my recipe back and I want everyone to stop make chop suey or pay I for the right to do the same so it be a early exercise of intellectual property right the thing be this idea of Chinese American food do not exist only in America in fact Chinese food be the most pervasive food on the planet serve on all seven continent even Antarctica because Monday night be Chinese food night at McMurdo Station which be the main scientific station in Antarctica you see different variety of Chinese food for example there be French Chinese food where they serve salt and pepper frog leg there be Italian Chinese food where they do not have fortune cookie so they serve fry gelato my neighbor Alessandra be shock when I tell she dude fry gelato be not Chinese she be like it be not but they serve it in all the Chinese restaurant in Italy laughter even the Brits have they own version this be a dish call crispy shredded beef which have a lot of crisp a lot of shred and not a lot of beef there be west Indian Chinese food there be Jamaican Chinese food Middle Eastern Chinese food Mauritian Chinese food this be a dish call Magic Bowl that I discover there be Indian Chinese food Korean Chinese food Japanese Chinese food where they take the bao the little bun and make they into pizza version laughter and they totally randomly take Chinese noodle dish and just ramenize they this be something that in the Chinese version have no soup so there be Peruvian Chinese food which should not be mix with Mexican Chinese food where they basically take thing and make it look like fajita laughter and they have thing like risotto chop suey my personal favorite of all the restaurant I have encounter around the world be this one in Brazil call Kung Food laughter so let take a step back and understand what be to be appreciate in America McDonald have garner a lot of attention a lot of respect for basically standardize the menu decor and dining experience in post World War II America but you know what they do so through a centralized headquarters out of Illinois Chinese restaurant have do largely the same thing I would argue with the menu and the decor even the restaurant name but without a centralized headquarters so this actually become very clear to I with the March 30 2005 Powerball draw where they expect base on the number of ticket sale they have to have three or four second place winner person who match five or six Powerball number instead they have 110 and they be completely shocked they look all across the country and discover it could not be fraud since it happen in different state across different computer system whatever it be it cause person to behave in a mass synchronize way so ok maybe it have to do with the pattern on the piece of paper like it be a diamond or diagonal it be not that so they be like ok let look at television so they look at a episode of lose now I do not have a tv which make I a freak but very productive laughter and there be a episode of lose where one guy have a lucky number but it be not a lucky number it be why he be on the island but they look and the number do not match they look at the Young and the restless it be not that either it be not until the first guy show up the next day and they ask he where do you get you number he say I get it from a fortune cookie this be a slip one of the winner have because the Tennessee lottery security official be like oh no this can not be true but it be true basically of that 110 person 104 of they or so have get they number from a fortune cookie laughter yeah so I go and start look I go across the country look for this restaurant where this person have get they fortune cookie from there be a bunch of they include Lee China in Omaha which be actually run by Korean but that be another point and a bunch of they name China Buffet what be interesting be that they story be similar but different it be lunch it be take out it be sit down it be buffet it be three week ago it be three month ago but at some point all this person have a very similar experience that converge at a fortune cookie and a Chinese restaurant and all this restaurant be serve fortune cookie which of course be not even Chinese to begin with it be part of the phenomenon I call spontaneous self organization where like in ant colony little decision make on the micro level actually have a big impact on the macro level a good contrast be Chicken McNuggets McDonald actually spend 10 year come out with a chicken like product they do chicken pot pie fry chicken and finally introduce Chicken McNuggets and the great innovation of Chicken McNuggets be not nuggify they that be kind of a easy concept the trick be they be able to remove the chicken from the bone in a cost efficient manner which be why it take so long for person to copy they 10 year then within a couple month it be such a hit they introduce it across the entire mcdonald system in the country in contrast be general tso chicken which actually start in New York City in the early 1970 as I be also start in this universe in New York City in the early 1970 laughter and this logo so I General Tso Chicken and this logo be all karmicly relate but that dish also take about 10 year to spread across America from a restaurant in New York City someone like it be sweet it be fry it be chicken American will love this so what I like to say this be Bay Area Silicon Valley be that we think of McDonald as sort of the Microsoft of dining experience we can think of Chinese restaurant perhaps as Linux sort of a open source thing right laughter where idea from one person can be copy and propagate across the entire system that there can be specialize version of Chinese food depend on the region for example in New Orleans we have Cajun Chinese food where they serve Sichuan alligator and sweet and sour crawfish and in Philadelphia you have Philadelphia cheesesteak roll which be like a egg roll on the outside and cheesesteak on the inside I be surprised to discover that not only in Philadelphia but also in Atlanta what have happen be a Chinese family have move from Philadelphia to Atlanta and bring that with they so the thing be we historical lore because of the way we like narrative be full of vast character such as Howard Schultz of Starbucks and Ray Kroc with McDonald and Asa Candler with Coca Cola but you know it be very easy to overlook the small character for example Lem Sen who introduce chop suey chef Peng who introduce General Tso Chicken and all the Japanese baker who introduce fortune cookie so the point of my presentation be to make you think twice that that whose name be forget in history can often have have as much if not more impact on what we eat today thank you very much applause
