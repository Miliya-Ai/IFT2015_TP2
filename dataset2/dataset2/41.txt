I be go to discuss with you three of my invention that can have a effect on 10 to a 100 million person which we will hope to see happen we discuss in the prior film some of the old thing that we do like stent and insulin pump for the diabetic and I would like to talk very briefly about three new invention that will change the life of many person at the present time it take a average of three hour after the first symptom of a heart attack be recognize by the patient before that patient arrive at a emergency room and person with silent ischemia which translate into English mean they do not have any symptom it take even long for they to get to the hospital the AMI Acute myocardial infarction which be a doctor big word so they can charge you more money laughter mean a heart attack Annual incidence 1 2 million American mortality 300 000 person die each year about half of they 600 000 have permanent damage to they heart that will cause they to have very bad problem later on thus 900 000 person either have die or have significant damage to they heart muscle symptom be often deny by the patient particularly we man because we be very brave we be very brave and we do not want to admit that I be have a hell of a chest pain then approximately 25 percent of all patient never have any symptom what be we go to do about they how can we save they life it be particularly true of diabetic and elderly woman well what be need for the early possible warning of a heart attack a mean to determine if there be a complete blockage of a coronary artery that lady and gentleman be a heart attack the mean consist of note something a little technical ST segment elevation of the electrogram translate into English that mean that if there be a electrical signal in the heart and one part of the ecg which we call the ST segment elevate that be a sure sign of a heart attack and if we have a computer put into the body of a person who be at risk we could know before they even have symptom that they be have a heart attack to save they life well the doctor can program a level of this ST elevation voltage that will trigger a emergency alarm vibration like you cell phone but right by you clavicle bone and when it go beep beep beep you good do something about it because if you want to live you have to get to some medical treatment so we have to try this device out because the FDA will not just let we use they on person unless we try it out first and the good model for this happen to be pig and what we try with the pig be external electrode on the skin like you see in a emergency room and I be go to show you why they do not work very well and then we put a lead which be a wire in the right ventricle inside the heart which do the electrogram which be the signal voltage from inside the heart well with the pig at the baseline before we block the pig artery to simulate a heart attack that be the signal after 43 second even a expert could not tell the difference and after three minute well if you really study it you would see a difference but what happen when we look inside the pig heart to the electrogram there be the baseline first of all a much big and more reliable signal Second of all I will bet even you person who be untrained can see the difference and we see here a ST segment elevation right after this sharp line look at the difference there it do not take much every layperson could see that difference and computer can be program to easily detect it then look at that after three minute we see that the signal that be actually in the heart we can use it to tell person that they be have a heart attack even before they have symptom so we can save they life then we try it with my son Dr Tim Fischell we try it on some human patient who have to have a stent put in well he keep the balloon fill to block the artery to simulate a blockage which be what a heart attack be and it be not hard to see that the baseline be the first picture on the upper left next to it at 30 second you see this rise here then this rise that be the ST elevation and if we have a computer that could detect it we could tell you you be have a heart attack so early it could save you life and prevent congestive heart failure and then he do it again we fill the balloon again a few minute later and here you see even after 10 second a great rise in this piece which we can have computer inside under you chest like a pacemaker with a wire into you heart like a pacemaker and computer do not go to sleep we have a little battery and on this little battery that computer will run for five year without need replacement what do the system look like well on the left be the IMD which be Implantable Medical device and tonight in the tent you can see it they have exhibit it it be about this big the size of a pacemaker it be implant with very conventional technique and the exd be a external device that you can have on you night table it will wake you up and tell you to get you tail to the emergency room when the thing go off because if you do not you be in deep doo doo and then finally a programmer that will set the level of the stimulation which be the level which say you be have a heart attack the FDA say ok test this final device after it be build in some animal which we say be a pig so we have to get this pig to have a heart attack and when you go to the farmyard you can not easily get pig to have heart attack so we say well we be expert in stent tonight you will see some of we invent stent we say so we will put in a stent but we be not go to put in a stent that we have put in person we be put in a copper stent and this copper stent erode the artery and cause heart attack that be not very nice but after all we have to find out what the answer be so we take two copper stent and we put it in the artery of this pig and let I show you the result that be very gratifying as far as person who have heart disease be concern so there it be Thursday morning we stop the pig medication and there be he electrogram the signal from inside the pig heart come out by radio telemetry then on Friday at 6 43 he begin to get certain sign which later we have the pig run around I be not go to go into this early stage but look what happen at 10 06 after we remove this pig medication that keep he from have a heart attack any one of you now be a expert on ST elevation can you see it there can you see it in the picture after the big rise of the QRS you see ST elevation this pig at 10 06 be have a heart attack what happen after you have the heart attack this blockage you rhythm become irregular and that be what happen 45 minute late then ventricular fibrillation the heart quiver instead of beat this be just before death of the pig and then the pig die it go flat line but we have a little bit over a hour where we could have save this pig life well because of the FDA we do not save the pig life because we need to do this type of animal research for human but when it come to the sake of a human we can save they life we can save the life of person who be at high risk for a heart attack what be the response to acute myocardial infarction a heart attack today well you feel some chest pain or indigestion it be not all that bad you decide not to do anything several hour pass and it get bad and even the man will not ignore it finally you go to the emergency room you wait as burn and other critical patient be treat because 75 percent of the patient who go to a emergency room with chest pain do not have AMI so you be not take very seriously they finally see you it take more time to get you electrocardiogram on you skin and diagnose it and it be hard to do because they do not have the baseline datum which the computer we put in you get finally if you be lucky you be treat in three or four hour after the incident but the heart muscle have die and that be the typical treatment in the advanced world not Africa that be the typical treatment in the advanced world today so we develop the AngelMed Guardian System and we have a device inside this patient call the implant AngelMed Guardian and when you have a blockage the alarm go off and it send the alarm and the electrogram to a external device which get you baseline electrogram from 24 hour ago and the one that cause the alarm so you can take it to the emergency room and show they and say take care of I right away then it go to a network operation center where they get you datum from you patient database that be be put in at some central location say in the United States then it go to a diagnostic center and within one minute of you heart attack you signal appear on the screen of a computer and the computer analyze what you problem be and the person who be there the medical practitioner call you this be also a cell phone and say Mr Smith you be in deep doo doo you have a problem we have call the ambulance the ambulance be on the way it will pick you up and then we be go to call you doctor tell he about it we be go to send he the signal that we have that say you have a heart attack and we be go to send the signal to the hospital and we be go to have it analyze there and there you be go to be with you doctor and you will be take care of so you will not die of a heart attack that be the first invention that I want to describe applause and now I want to talk about something entirely different at first I do not think migraine headache be a big problem because I would never have a migraine headache but then I speak to some person who have three or four every week of they life and they life be be totally ruin by it we have a mission statement for we company do migraine which be prevent or ameliorate migraine headache by the application of a safe control magnetic pulse apply as need by the patient now you be probably very few physicist here if you be a physicist you would know there be a certain Faraday Law which say if I apply a magnetic pulse on salt water that be you brain by the way it will generate electric current and the electric current in the brain can erase a migraine headache that be what we have discover so here be a picture of what we be do the patient who have a migraine precede by a aura have a band of excited neuron that show in red that move at three to five millimeter a minute towards the mid brain and when it hit the mid brain that be when the headache begin there be this migraine that be precede by a visual aura and this visual aura by the way and I will show you a picture but it sort of begin with little dancing light get big and big until it fill you whole visual field and what we try be this here be a device call the Cadwell Model MES10 weigh about 70 pound have a wire about a inch in diameter and here be one of the patient who have a aura and always have a headache bad one after the aura what do we do this be what a aura look like it be sort of funny dancing light show there on the left and right side and that be a fully develop visual aura as we see on top in the middle we experimentalist the neurologist who say I be go to move this down a little and I be go to erase half you aura and by God the neurologist do erase it and that be the middle picture half of the aura erase by a short magnetic pulse what do that mean that mean that the magnetic pulse be generate a electric current that be interfere with the erroneous electrical activity in the brain and finally he say ok now I be go to all of the aura get erase with a appropriately place magnetic pulse what be the result we design a magnetic depolarizer that look like this that you could have a lady in she pocket book and when you get a aura you can try it and see how it work well the next thing they have to show be what be on ABC News Channel 7 last week in New York City in the 11 o clock news Anchor for anyone who suffer from migraine headache and there be 30 million American who do tonight a possible answer eyewitness news reporter Stacy Sager tonight with a small and portable machine that literally zap you migraine away Christina Sidebottom well my first reaction be that it be look awfully gun like and it be very strange Stacy Sager but for Christina Sidebottom almost anything be worth try if it could stop a migraine it may look silly or even frightening as you walk around with it in you purse but researcher here in Ohio organize clinical trial for this migraine zapper say it be scientifically sound that in fact when the average person get a migraine it be cause by something similar to a electrical impulse the zapper create a magnetic field to counteract that Yousef Mohammed in other word we be treat electricity with electricity rather than treat electricity with the chemical that we be use nowadays SS but be it safe to use everyday expert say the research have actually be around for more than a decade and more long term study need to be do Christina now swear by it CS it be be the most wonderful thing for my migraine ss researcher be hope to present they study to the FDA this summer Robert Fischell and that be the invention to treat migraine applause you see the problem be 30 million American have migraine headache and we need a mean to treat it and I think that we now have it and this be the first device that we do and I be go to talk about my second wish which have something to do with this we conclusion from we study so far at three research center be there be a marked improvement in pain level after use it just once the most severe headache respond good after we do it several time and the unexpected finding indicate that even establish headache not only that with aura get treat and get diminish and aura can be erase and the migraine then do not occur and that be the migraine invention that we be talk about and that we be work on applause the third and last invention begin with a idea Epilepsy can best be treat by responsive electrical stimulation now why do we use add on nearly a epileptic focus now unfortunately we technical person unlike Mr Bono have to get into all this technical word well responsive electrical stimulation mean that we sense at a place in you brain which be call a epileptic focus which be where the epileptic seizure begin we sense there that it be go to happen and then we respond by apply a electrical energy at that spot which erase the errant signal so that you do not get the clinical manifestation of the migraine headache we use current pacemaker defibrillator technology that be use for the heart we think we could adapt it for the brain the device could be implant under the scalp to be totally hide and avoid wire breakage which occur if you put it in the chest and you try to move you neck around Form a company to develop a neuro pacemaker for epilepsy as well as other disease of the brain because all disease of the brain be a result of some electrical malfunction in it that cause many if not all of brain disorder we form a company call NeuroPace and we start work on responsive neurostimulation and this be a picture of what the device look like that be place into the cranial bone this be probably a well picture here we have we device in which we put in a frame there be a cut make in the scalp it be open the neurosurgeon have a template he mark it around and use a dental burr to remove a piece of the cranial bone exactly the size of we device and tonight you will be able to see the device in the tent and then with four screw we put in a frame then we snap in the device and we run with wire the one show in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrode to the epileptic focus the origin of the epilepsy where we can sense the electrical signal and have computer analysis that tell we when to hit it with some electrical current to prevent the clinical manifestation of the seizure in the blue wire we see what be call a deep brain electrode if that be the source of the epilepsy we can attack that as well the comprehensive solution this be the device it be about one inch by two inch and oddly enough just the thickness of most cranial bone the advantage of responsive neurostimulation it can detect and terminate seizure before the clinical symptom occur provide stimulation only when need can be turn off if seizure disappear it have minimal side effect as a matter of fact in all we clinical trial to date we have see no side effect in the 40 or so patient in whom it be be implant and it be invisible cosmetically hide so if you have epilepsy and you have the device no one will know it because you can not tell that it be there and this show what a electroencephalogram be and on the left be the signal of a spontaneous seizure of one of the patient then we stimulate and you see how that heavy black line and then you see the electroencephalogram signal go to normal which mean they do not get the epileptic seizure that conclude my discussion of epilepsy which be the third invention that I want to discuss here this afternoon applause I have three wish well I can not do much about Africa I be a tech I be into medical gadgetry which be mostly high tech stuff like Mr Bono talk about the first wish be to use the epilepsy responsive neurostimulator call rn for responsive NeuroStimulator that be a brilliant acronym for the treatment of other brain disorder well if we be go to do it for epilepsy why the hell not try it for something else then you see what that device look like that the woman be use to fix she migraine I tell you this that be something which some research engineer like I would concoct not a real designer of good equipment laughter we want to have some person who really know how to do this perform human engineering study to develop the optimum design for the portable device for treat migraine headache and some of the sponsor of this TED meeting be such organization then we be go to challenge the TED attendee to come up with a way to improve health care in the USA where we have problem that Africa do not have and by reduce malpractice litigation malpractice litigation be not a African problem it be a American problem applause so to get quickly to my first wish the brain operate by electrical signal if the electrical signal create a brain disorder electro stimulation can overcome that disorder by act on the brain neuron in other word if you have screw up electrical signal maybe by put other electrical signal from a computer in the brain we can counteract that a signal in the brain that trigger brain dysfunction might be sense as a trigger for electro stimulation like we be do with epilepsy but even if there be no signal electro stimulation of a appropriate part of the brain can turn off a brain disorder and consider treat psychotic disorder and I want this involve with the TED group such as obsessive compulsive disorder that presently be not well treat with drug and include five million American and Mr Fischer and he group at NeuroPace and myself believe that we can have a dramatic effect in improve OCD in America and in the world that be the first wish applause the second wish be at the present time the clinical trial of transcranial magnetic stimulator that be what tm mean device to treat migraine headache appear to be quite successful well that be the good news the present portable device be far from optimally design both as to human factor as appearance I think she say it look like a gun a lot of person do not like gun laughter engage a company have prior success for human factor engineering and industrial design to optimize the design of the first portable tm device that will be sell to the patient who have migraine headache and that be the second wish applause and of the 100 000 dollar prize money that TED be so generous to give I I be donate 50 000 dollar to the NeuroPace person to get on with the treatment of OCD obsessive compulsive disorder and I be make another 50 000 available for a company to optimize the design of the device for migraine and that be how I will use my 100 000 dollar prize money applause well the third and final wish be somewhat unfortunately it be much more complicated because it involve lawyer laughter well medical malpractice litigation in the US have escalate the cost of malpractice insurance so that competent physician be leave they practice lawyer take case on contingency with the hope of a big share of a big settlement by a sympathetic jury because this patient really end up badly the high cost of health care in the US be partly due to litigation and insurance cost I have see picture graph in today USA Today show it skyrocket out of control and this be one factor well how can the TED community help with this situation I have a couple of idea to begin with as a starting point for discussion with the TED group a major part of the problem be the nature of the write extent of informed consent that the patient or spouse must read and sign for example I ask the epilepsy person what be they use for informed consent would you believe 12 page single space the patient have to read before they be in we trial to cure they epilepsy what do you think someone have at the end of read 12 single space page they do not understand what the hell it be about laughter that be the present system how about make a video we have entertainment person here we have person who know how to do video with visual presentation of the anatomy and procedure do with animation everybody know that we can do good with a visual thing that can be interactive with the patient where they see the video and they be be video and they press do you understand this no I do not well then let go to a simple explanation then there be a simple one and oh yes I understand that well press the button and you be on record you understand and that be one of the idea now also a video be do of the patient or spouse and medical presenter with the patient agree that he understand the procedure to be do include all the possible failure mode the patient or spouse agree not to file a lawsuit if one of the know procedure failure occur now in America in fact you can not give up you right to trial by jury however if a video be there that everything be explain to you and you have it all in the video file it will be much less likely that some hotshot lawyer will take this case on contingency because it will not be nearly as good a case if a medical error occur the patient or spouse agree to a settlement for fair compensation by arbitration instead of go to court that would save hundred of million of dollar in legal cost in the United States and would decrease the cost of medicine for everyone this be just some start point and so there that be the end of all my wish I wish I have more wish but three be what I have get and there they be applause
