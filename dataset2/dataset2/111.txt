thank you and I feel like this whole evening have be very amazing to I I feel it be sort of like the vimalakirtus sutra a ancient work from ancient India in which the Buddha appear at the beginning and a whole bunch of person come to see he from the big city in the area Vaishali and they bring some sort of jeweled parasol to make a offering to he all the young person actually from the city the old fogey do not come because they be mad at Buddha because when he come to they city he accept he always accept the first invitation that come to he from whoever it be and the local geisha a movie star sort of person race the elder of the city in a chariot and invite he first so he be hang out with the movie star and of course they be grumble he be suppose to be religious and all this what be he do over there at Amrapali house with all he 500 monk and so on they be all grumble and so they boycott he they would not go listen to he but the young person all come and they bring this kind of a jeweled parasol and they put it on the ground and as soon as they have lay all this all they big stack of this jeweled parasol that they use to carry in ancient India he perform a kind of special effect which make it into a giant planetarium the wonder of the universe everyone look in that and they see in there the total interconnectedness of all life in all universe and of course in the Buddhist cosmos there be million and billion of planet with human life on it and enlighten be can see the life on all the other planet so they do not when they look out and they see that light that you show in the sky they do not just see sort of piece of matter burn or rock or flame or gas explode they actually see landscape and human being and god and dragon and serpent be and goddess and thing like that he make that special effect at the beginning to get everyone to think about interconnection and interconnectedness and how everything in life be totally interconnect and then Leilei I know he other name tell we about interconnection and how we be all totally interconnect here and how we have all know each other and of course in the Buddhist universe we have already do this already billion of time in many many lifetime in the past and I do not give the talk always you do and we have to watch you and so forth and we be all still try to I guess we be all try to become tedster if that be a modern form of enlightenment I guess so because in a way if a tedster relate to all the interconnectedness of all the computer and everything it be the forge of a mass awareness of where everybody can really know everything that be go on everywhere in the planet and therefore it will become intolerable what compassion be be where it will become intolerable for we totally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoy the life of the mind or whatever it be and there be person who be absolutely riddled with disease and they can not have a bite of food and they have no place or they be be brutalize by some terrible person and so forth it just become intolerable with all of we know everything we be kind of force by technology to become Buddhas or something to become enlightened and of course we all will be deeply disappointed when we do because we think that because we be kind of tired of what we do a little bit tired we do suffer we do enjoy we misery in a certain way we distract ourselves from we misery by run around somewhere but basically we all have this common misery that we be sort of stuck inside we skin and everyone else be out there and occasionally we get together with another person stuck in they skin and the two of we enjoy each other and each one try to get out of they own and ultimately it fail of course and then we be back into this thing because we egocentric perception from the Buddha point of view misperception be that all we be be what be inside we skin and it be inside and outside self and other and other be all very different and everyone here be unfortunately carry that habitual perception a little bit right you know someone sit next to you in a seat that be ok because you be in a theater but if you be sit on a park bench and someone come up and sit that close to you you would freak out what do they want from I like who be that and so you would not sit that close to another person because of you notion that it be you versus the universe that be all Buddha discover because that cosmic basic idea that it be we all alone each of we and everyone else be different then that put we in a impossible situation do not it who be it who be go to get enough attention from the world who be go to get enough out of the world who be not go to be overrun by a infinite number of other be if you be different from all the other be so where compassion come be where you surprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way through art through meditation through understanding through knowledge actually know that you have no such boundary know you interconnectedness with other be you can experience yourself as the other be when you see through the delusion of be separate from they when you do that you be force to feel what they feel luckily they say I still be not sure but luckily they say that when you reach that point because some person have say in the Buddhist literature they say oh who would really want to be compassionate how awful I be so miserable on my own my head be ache my bone be ache I go from birth to death I be never satisfied I never have enough even if I be a billionaire I do not have enough I need a hundred billion so I be like that imagine if I have to feel even a hundred other person suffer it would be terrible but apparently this be a strange paradox of life when you be no long lock in yourself and as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge of the nature of the world that enable you to let you mind spread out and empathize and enhance the basic human ability of empathize and realize that you be the other be somehow by that opening you can see the deep nature of life and you can you get away from this terrible iron circle of I I I mine like the Beatles use to sing you know we really learn everything in the 60 too bad nobody ever wake up to it and they have be try to suppress it since then I I I mine it be like a perfect song that song a perfect teaching but when we be relieve from that we somehow then become interested in all the other be and we feel ourselves differently it be totally strange it be totally strange the Dalai Lama always like to say he say that when you give birth in you mind to the idea of compassion it be because you realize that you yourself and you pain and pleasure be finally too small a theater for you intelligence it be really too boring whether you feel like this or like that or what you know and the more you focus on how you feel by the way the bad it get like even when you be have a good time when be the good time over the good time be over when you think how good be it and then it be never good enough I love that Leilei say that the way of help that who be suffer badly on the physical plane or on other plane be have a good time do it by have a good time I think the Dalai Lama should have hear that I wish he have be there to hear that he once tell I he look kind of sad he worry very much about the haves and have not he look a little sad because he say well a hundred year ago they go and take everything away from the haves you know the big communist revolution Russia and China and so forth they take it all away by violence say they be go to give it to everyone and then they be even bad they do not help at all so what could possibly change this terrible gap that have open up in the world today and so then he look at I so I say well you know you be all in this yourself you teach it be generosity be all I could think of what be virtue but of course what you say I think the key to save the world the key to compassion be that it be more fun it should be do by fun generosity be more fun that be the key everybody have the wrong idea they think Buddha be so boring and they be so surprised when they meet Dalai Lama and he be fairly jolly even though he person be be genocide and believe I he feel every blow on every old nun head in every Chinese prison he feel it he feel the way they be harvest yak nowadays I will not even say what they do but he feel it and yet he be very jolly he be extremely jolly because when you open up like that then you can not just what good do it do to add be miserable with other misery you have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it be how it can be change look at that beautiful thing Chiho show we she scare we with the lava man she scare we with the lava man be come then the tsunami be come but then finally there be flower and tree and it be very beautiful it be really lovely so compassion mean to feel the feeling of other and the human being actually be compassion the human being be almost out of time the human being be compassion because what be we brain for now Jim brain be memorize the almanac but he could memorize all the need of all the be that he be he will he do he could memorize all kind of fantastic thing to help many be and he would have tremendous fun do that so the first person who get happy when you stop focus on the self center situation of how happy am I where you be always dissatisfied as Mick Jagger tell we you never get any satisfaction that way so then you decide well I be sick of myself I be go to think of how other person can be happy I be go to get up in the morning and think what can I do for even one other person even a dog my dog my cat my pet my butterfly and the first person who get happy when you do that you do not do anything for anybody else but you get happy you yourself because you whole perception broaden and you suddenly see the whole world and all of the person in it and you realize that this be with this person be the flower garden that Chiho show we it be Nirvana and my time be up and I know the TED commandment thank you
