I have a story a story that I would like to share with you and it be a African story it be a story of hope resilience and glamour there be Hollywood then come Bollywood today we have Nollywood the third large film industry in the world in 2006 alone almost 2 000 film be make in Nigeria now try to imagine 40 50 film wrap distribute every week in the street of Lagos Nigeria and West Africa some estimate put the value of this industry at 250 million dollar it have create thousand if not ten of thousand of job and it be expand but keep in mind that this be a grassroots movement this be something that happen without foreign investment without government aid and actually it happen against all odds in one of the most difficult moment in Nigerian economy the industry be 15 year old and so maybe you be think now why how a Italian filmmaker base in Boston be so interested in this story and so I think I have to tell you just a few word a few thing about my personal life because I think there be a connection my grandfather live most of he life and be bury in Zambia my father also live most of he adult life in East Africa and I be bear in Zambia even though I leave when I be only three year old I really feel that Africa be this big part of my life and it really be a place where I learn to walk I think I utter the first word and my family buy they first home so when we come back to Italy and one of the thing that I remember the most be my family have this hard time to share story it seem that for we neighbor and friend Africa be either this exotic place this imaginary land that probably exist only in they imagination or the place of horror famine and so we be always catch in this stereotype and I remember really this desire to talk about Africa as a place where we live and person live and go about they life and have dream like we all have so when I read in a newspaper in the business page the story of Nollywood I really feel this be a incredible opportunity to tell a story that go against all this preconceived notion here I can tell a story of African make movie like I do and actually I feel this be a inspiration for I I have the good fortune of be a filmmaker in residence at the Center of Digital Imaging Arts at Boston University and we really look how digital technology be change and how young independent filmmaker can make movie at a fraction of the cost so when I propose the story I really have all the support to make this film and not only have the support I find two wonderful partner in crime in this adventure Aimee Corrigan a very talented and young photographer and Robert Caputo a friend and a mentor who be a veteran of National Geographic and tell I you know Franco in 25 year of cover Africa I do not know if I have come across a story that be so full of hope and so fun so we go to Lagos in October 2005 and we go to Lagos to meet Bond Emeruwa a wonderful talented film director who be with we tonight the plan be to give you a portrait of Nollywood of this incredible film industry follow bond in he quest to make a action movie that deal with the issue of corruption call Checkpoint Police corruption and he have nine day to make it we think this be a good story in the meantime we have to cover Nollywood and we talk to a lot of filmmaker but I do not want to create too many expectation I would like to show you six minute and this be six minute they really prepare for the TED audience there be several theme from the documentary but they be re edit and make for you ok so I guess it be a world premier video Man Action Milverton Nwokedi you cut a nice movie with just 10 000 dollar in Nigeria here and you shoot in seven day Peace Piberesima we be do film for the mass we be not do film for the elite and the person in they glass house they can afford to watch they Robocop and whatever Mahmood Ali Balogun I think filmmaking in Nigeria for that who work in it be a kind of subsistence filmmaking what they do to make a living it be not the fancy filmmaking where you say oh you want to put all the razzmatazz of Hollywood and where you have big budget here be that you make this film it sell you jump onto the location again to make another film because if you do not make the next film you be not go to feed bond Emeruwa so while we be entertain we should be able to educate I believe in the power of audiovisual I mean 90 percent of the population will watch Nollywood I think it be the most viable vehicle right now to pass information across a dedicated cable so if you be make a movie no matter what you topic be put in a message in there Woman you still have to report the incident he need proper medical attention pp I keep try to explain to person it be not about the quality at the moment the quality be come I mean there be that film that person be make for quality but the first thing you have to remember about this society be that Africa still have person that live on one dollar a day and this be the person that really watch this film Sonny McDon W Nollywood be a fantastic industry that have just be bear in this part of the world because nobody believe that Nollywood can come out of Africa Lancelot Imasen but we film they be story that we person can relate to themselves they be story about we person for we person and consistently they be glue to they screen whenever they see the story Narrator suspense fun and intrigue it be the blockbuster comedy you will crack you rib Bernard Pinayon Agbaosi we have be so deep into the foreign movie it be all about the foreign movie but we can do something too we can do something something that when the world see it they say wow this be Nigeria Man just arrest yourself sergeant do not embarrass yourself come on do not run away come back come back SMW you can now walk the street and see a role model it not just what you see in picture you see the person live you see how he talk you see how he live he influence you really good you know it not just what you see in the picture it be not what you hear you know from the western press man see you bye Action Saint Obi I be so fascinated you know with that cowboy movie but then when I discover the situation in my country at that time there be so much corruption for a young man to really make it out here you get to think of some negative thing and all that or some kind of vice and I do not want that you know and I discover that I could be successful in life as a actor without do crime without cheat nobody without tell no lie just I and God give talent man let go ok it be time to kick some ass cover this it be you own move it Roboger Animadu in big country when they do the movie they have all this thing in place but here we improvise this item like the gunshot like they go here now now you see the gun there but you will not see any gun shoot we use knock out Kevin Books Ikeduba what I be scared of be just the explosion will come up in my face woman that be why I use enough masking tape the masking tape will hold it Wat wait just hold this for I KBI I be just tell she to make sure she place it well so that it will not affect my face the explosion you know but she be a professional she know what she do I be try to protect my face too this be not go to be my last movie you know this be Nollywood where the magic live ra so now you be about to see how we do we own movie here with or without any assistance from anybody man action cut applause Franco Sacchi so many thing to say so little time so many theme in this story I just can not tell you there one thing I want to tell you I spend you know several week with all this actor producer and the problem they have to go through be unimaginable for you know a Westerner a filmmaker who work in America or in Europe but always with a smile always with a enthusiasm that be incredible Werner Herzog the German filmmaker say I need to make movie like you need oxygen and I think they be breathing the Nigerian filmmaker really really be do what they like and so it be a very very important thing for they and for they audience a woman tell I when I see a nollywood film I can relax I really I can breathe better there be also another very important thing that I hope will resonate with this audience it technology I be very interested in it and I really think that the digital non linear editing have slash you know the cost now be a fraction of what it use to be incredible camera cost under 5 000 dollar and this have unleash tremendous energy and guess what we do not have to tell to the Nigerian filmmaker they understand it they embrace the technology and they run with it and they be successful I hope that the Nollywood phenomenon will go both way I hope it will inspire other African nation to embrace the technology look at the Nigerian model make they film create job create a narrative for the population something to identify something positive something that really be psychological relief and it be part of the culture but I really think this be a phenomenon that can inspire we I really think it go both way filmmaker friend of mine they look at Nollywood and they say wow they be do what we really want to do and make a buck and live with this job so I really think it a lesson that we be actually learn from they and there be one thing one small challenge that I have for you and should make we reflect on the importance of storytelling and I think this be really the theme of this session try to imagine a world where the only goal be food and a shelter but no story no story around the campfire no legend no fairytales nothing no novel difficult eh it be meaningless so this be what I really think I think that the key to a healthy society be a thriving community of storyteller and I think that the Nigerian filmmaker really have prove this I would like you to hear they voice just a few moment it not a add sequence just some voice from Nollywood Video Toyin Alousa Nollywood be the good thing that can happen to they if you have a industry that put a smile on person face that nollywood so I believe very soon we be not only go to have good movie we will have that original Nigerian movie be it still the same basic theme love action but we be tell it we own way we own Nigerian way African way we have diverse culture diverse culture there be so many that in the natal lifetime I do not see we exhaust the story we have fs my job end here and the nollywood filmmaker really have now to work and I really hope that there will be many many collaboration where we teach each other thing and I really hope that this will happen thank you very much applause Chris Anderson Stop I have get two question Franco you describe this as the world third large film industry what do that translate to in term of number of film really fs oh yes I think I mention briefly it be close to 2 000 film there be scientific datum on this ca 2 000 film a year fs 2 000 film a year 2005 or 6 the censor board have censor 1 600 film alone and we know that there be more so it safe to say that there be 2 000 film so imagine 45 film per week there be challenge there be challenge there be a glut of film the quality have to be raise they need to go to the next level but I be optimistic ca and this be not film that be primarily see in cinema fs oh yes of course this be very important maybe you know for you to try to imagine this this be film that be distribute directly in market they be buy in video shop they can be rent for penny CA on what format fs oh the format thank you for the question yes it be vcd it be a cd it be a little bit more compressed image they start with VHS they actually do not wait for you know the late technology they start in 92 94 so there be 57 million vcr in Nigeria that play you know VHS and this vcd it be a cd basically it be a compact disc ca so on the street be film cast fs you can be in a Lagos traffic jam and you can buy a movie or some banana or some water yes laughter and I have to say this really prove that storytelling it be a commodity it be a staple there be no life without story CA Franco thank you so much
