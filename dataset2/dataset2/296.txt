what I want to tell you about today be how I see robot invade we life at multiple level over multiple timescale and when I look out in the future I can not imagine a world 500 year from now where we do not have robot everywhere assume despite all the dire prediction from many person about we future assume we be still around I can not imagine the world not be populate with robot and then the question be well if they be go to be here in 500 year be they go to be everywhere soon than that be they go to be around in 50 year yeah I think that be pretty likely there be go to be lot of robot everywhere and in fact I think that be go to be a lot soon than that I think we be sort of on the cusp of robot become common and I think we be sort of around 1978 or 1980 in personal computer year where the first few robot be start to appear computer sort of come around through game and toy and you know the first computer most person have in the house may have be a computer to play Pong a little microprocessor embed and then other game that come after that and we be start to see that same sort of thing with robot LEGO Mindstorms Furbies who here do anyone here have a Furby yeah there be 38 million of they sell worldwide they be pretty common and they be a little tiny robot a simple robot with some sensor a little bit of processing actuation on the right there be another robot doll who you could get a couple of year ago and just as in the early day when there be a lot of sort of amateur interaction over computer you can now get various hacking kit how to hack book and on the leave there be a platform from Evolution Robotics where you put a pc on and you program this thing with a GUI to wander around you house and do various stuff and then there be a high price point sort of robot toy the Sony Aibo and on the right there be one that the NEC develop the papero which I do not think they be go to release but nevertheless that sort of thing be out there and we have see over the last two or three year lawn mowing robot Husqvarna on the bottom Friendly Robotics on top there a Israeli company and then in the last 12 month or so we have start to see a bunch of home cleaning robot appear the top left one be a very nice home clean robot from a company call Dyson in the U K except it be so expensive 3 500 dollar they do not release it but at the bottom leave you see Electrolux which be on sale another one from Karcher at the bottom right be one that I build in my lab about 10 year ago and we finally turn that into a product and let I just show you that we be go to give this away I think Chris say after the talk this be a robot that you can go out and buy and that will clean up you floor and it start off sort of just go around in ever increase circle if it hit something you person see that now it be do wall follow it be follow around my foot to clean up around I let see let oh who steal my Rice Krispies they steal my Rice Krispies laughter do not worry relax no relax it be a robot it be smart laughter see the three year old kid they do not worry about it it be grow up that get really upset laughter we will just put some crap here laughter okay laughter I do not know if you see so I put a bunch of Rice Krispies there I put some penny let just shoot it at that see if it clean up yeah ok so we will leave that for later applause part of the trick be build a good cleaning mechanism actually the intelligence on board be fairly simple and that be true with a lot of robot we have all I think become sort of computational chauvinist and think that computation be everything but the mechanic still matter here be another robot the PackBot that we have be build for a bunch of year it be a military surveillance robot to go in ahead of troops look at cave for instance but we have to make it fairly robust much more robust than the robot we build in we lab laughter on board that robot be a pc run Linux it can withstand a 400g shock the robot have local intelligence it can flip itself over can get itself into communication range can go upstairs by itself et cetera okay so it be do local navigation there a soldier give it a command to go upstairs and it do that be not a control descent laughter now it be go to head off and the big breakthrough for this robot really be September 11th we have the robot down at the World Trade Center late that evening could not do a lot in the main rubble pile thing be just too there be nothing left to do but we do go into all the surround building that have be evacuate and search for possible survivor in the building that be too dangerous to go into let run this video reporter battlefield companion be help to reduce the combat risk Nick Robertson have that story Rodney Brooks can we have another one of this okay good so this be a corporal who have see a robot two week previously he be send robot into cave look at what be go on the robot be totally autonomous the bad thing that be happen in the cave so far be one of the robot fall down ten meter so one year ago the US military do not have this robot now they be on active duty in Afghanistan every day and that be one of the reason they say a robot invasion be happen there be a sea change happen in how where technology be go thanks and over the next couple of month we be go to be send robot in production down produce oil well to get that last few year of oil out of the ground very hostile environment 150 c 10 000 PSI Autonomous robot go down do this sort of work but robot like this they be a little hard to program how in the future be we go to program we robot and make they easy to use and I want to actually use a robot here a robot name Chris stand up yeah okay come over here now notice he think robot have to be a bit stiff he sort of do that but I be go to Chris Anderson I be just British RB oh laughter applause I be go to show this robot a task it be a very complex task now notice he nod there he be give I some indication he be understand the flow of communication and if I would say something completely bizarre he would have look askance at I and regulate the conversation so now I bring this up in front of he I would look at he eye and I see he eye look at this bottle top and I be do this task here and he be check up he eye be go back and forth up to I to see what I be look at so we have get share attention and so I do this task and he look and he look to I to see what be happen next and now I will give he the bottle and we will see if he can do the task can you do that laughter okay he be pretty good yeah good good good I do not show you how to do that now see if you can put it back together laughter and he think a robot have to be really slow good robot that be good so we see a bunch of thing there we see when we be interact we be try to show someone how to do something we direct they visual attention the other thing communicate they internal state to we whether he be understand or not regulate a social interaction there be share attention look at the same sort of thing and recognize socially communicate reinforcement at the end and we have be try to put that into we lab robot because we think this be how you be go to want to interact with robot in the future I just want to show you one technical diagram here the most important thing for build a robot that you can interact with socially be its visual attention system because what it pay attention to be what it be see and interact with and what you be understand what it be do so in the video I be about to show you you be go to see a visual attention system on a robot which have it look for skin tone in HSV space so it work across all human coloring it look for highly saturate color from toy and it look for thing that move around and it weight that together into a attention window and it look for the high scoring place the stuff where the most interesting stuff be happen and that be what its eye then segue to and it look right at that at the same time some top down sort of stuff might decide that it be lonely and look for skin tone or might decide that it be bored and look for a toy to play with and so this weight change and over here on the right this be what we call the Steven Spielberg memorial module do person see the movie ai audience yes RB yeah it be really bad but remember especially when Haley Joel Osment the little robot look at the blue fairy for 2 000 year without take he eye off it well this get rid of that because this be a habituation Gaussian that get negative and more and more intense as it look at one thing and it get bored so it will then look away at something else so once you have get that and here be a robot here be Kismet look around for a toy you can tell what it be look at you can estimate its gaze direction from that eyeball cover its camera and you can tell when it be actually see the toy and it be get a little bit of a emotional response here laughter but it be still go to pay attention if something more significant come into its field of view such as Cynthia Breazeal the builder of this robot from the right it see she pay attention to she Kismet have a underlie three dimensional emotional space a vector space of where it be emotionally and at different place in that space it express can we have the volume on here can you hear that now out there Audience yeah Kismet do you really think so do you really think so do you really think so RB so it be express its emotion through its face and the prosody in its voice and when I be deal with my robot over here Chris the robot be measure the prosody in my voice and so we have the robot measure prosody for four basic message that mother give they child pre linguistically here we have get naive subject praise the robot Voice Nice robot you be such a cute little robot laughter RB and the robot react appropriately Voice very good kismet laughter Voice look at my smile RB it smile she imitate the smile this happen a lot this be naive subject here we ask they to get the robot attention and indicate when they have the robot attention Voice Hey Kismet ah there it be RB so she realize she have the robot attention Voice Kismet do you like the toy oh RB now here they be ask to prohibit the robot and this first woman really push the robot into a emotional corner Voice No No you be not to do that no laughter not appropriate no no laughter RB I be go to leave it at that we put that together then we put in turn take when we talk to someone we talk then we sort of raise we eyebrow move we eye give the other person the idea it be they turn to talk and then they talk and then we pass the baton back and forth between each other so we put this in the robot we get a bunch of naive subject in we do not tell they anything about the robot sit they down in front of the robot and say talk to the robot now what they do not know be the robot be not understand a word they say and that the robot be not speak English it be just say random English phoneme and I want you to watch carefully at the beginning of this where this person Ritchie who happen to talk to the robot for 25 minute laughter say I want to show you something I want to show you my watch and he bring the watch center into the robot field of vision point to it give it a motion cue and the robot look at the watch quite successfully we do not know whether he understand or not that the robot notice the turn take Ritchie ok I want to show you something ok this be a watch that my girlfriend give I Robot oh cool Ritchie yeah look it be get a little blue light in it too I almost lose it this week laughter RB so it be make eye contact with he follow he eye Ritchie can you do the same thing Robot yeah sure RB and they successfully have that sort of communication and here be another aspect of the sort of thing that Chris and I be do this be another robot cog they first make eye contact and then when Christie look over at this toy the robot estimate she gaze direction and look at the same thing that she be look at laughter so we be go to see more and more of this sort of robot over the next few year in lab but then the big question two big question that person ask I be if we make this robot more and more human like will we accept they will we will they need right eventually and the other question person ask I be will they want to take over laughter and on the first you know this have be a very Hollywood theme with lot of movie you probably recognize this character here where in each of this case the robot want more respect well do you ever need to give robot respect they be just machine after all but I think you know we have to accept that we be just machine after all that be certainly what modern molecular biology say about we you do not see a description of how you know Molecule A you know come up and dock with this other molecule and it be move forward you know propel by various charge and then the soul step in and tweak that molecule so that they connect it be all mechanistic we be mechanism if we be machine then in principle at least we should be able to build machine out of other stuff which be just as alive as we be but I think for we to admit that we have to give up on we special ness in a certain way and we have have the retreat from special ness under the barrage of science and technology many time over the last few hundred year at least 500 year ago we have to give up the idea that we be the center of the universe when the earth start to go around the sun 150 year ago with Darwin we have to give up the idea we be different from animal and to imagine you know it be always hard for we recently we have be batter with the idea that maybe we do not even have we own creation event here on earth which person do not like much and then the human genome say maybe we only have 35 000 gene and that be really person do not like that we have get more gene than that we do not like to give up we special ness so you know have the idea that robot could really have emotion or that robot could be live creature I think be go to be hard for we to accept but we be go to come to accept it over the next 50 year or so and the second question be will the machine want to take over and here the standard scenario be that we create this thing they grow we nurture they they learn a lot from we and then they start to decide that we be pretty boring slow they want to take over from we and for that of you that have teenager you know what that be like laughter but Hollywood extend it to the robot and the question be you know will someone accidentally build a robot that take over from we and that be sort of like this lone guy in the backyard you know I accidentally build a 747 I do not think that be go to happen and I do not think laughter I do not think we be go to deliberately build robot that we be uncomfortable with we will you know they be not go to have a super bad robot before that have to come to be a mildly bad robot and before that a not so bad robot laughter and we be just not go to let it go that way laughter so I think I be go to leave it at that the robot be come we do not have too much to worry about it be go to be a lot of fun and I hope you all enjoy the journey over the next 50 year applause
