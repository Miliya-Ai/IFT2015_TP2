if you be at all like I this be what you do with the sunny summer weekend in San Francisco you build experimental kite power hydrofoil capable of more than 30 knot and you realize that there be incredible power in the wind and it can do amazing thing and one day a vessel not unlike this will probably break the world speed record but kite be not just toy like this Kites I be go to give you a brief history and tell you about the magnificent future of every child favorite plaything so kite be more than a thousand year old and the Chinese use they for military application and even for lift man so they know at that stage they could carry large weight I be not sure why there be a hole in this particular man laughter in 1827 a fellow call George Pocock actually pioneer the use of kite for tow buggy in race against horse carriage across the English countryside then of course at the dawn of aviation all of the great inventor of the time like Hargreaves like Langley even Alexander Graham Bell inventor of the telephone who be fly this kite be do so in the pursuit of aviation then this two fellow come along and they be fly kite to develop the control system that would ultimately enable powered human flight so this be of course Orville and Wilbur Wright and the Wright Flyer and they experiment with kite lead to this momentous occasion where we power up and take off for the first ever 12 second human flight and that be fantastic for the future of commercial aviation but unfortunately it relegate kite once again to be consider child toy that be until the 1970 where we have the last energy crisis and a fabulous man call Miles Loyd who live on the outskirts of San Francisco write this seminal paper that be completely ignore in the Journal of Energy about how to use basically a airplane on a piece of string to generate enormous amount of electricity the real key observation he make be that a free flying wing can sweep through more sky and generate more power in a unit of time than a fixed wing turbine so turbine grow and they can now span up to three hundred foot at the hub height but they can not really go a lot high and more height be where the more wind be and more power as much as twice as much so cut to now we still have a energy crisis and now we have a climate crisis as well you know so human generate about 12 trillion watt or 12 terawatt from fossil fuel and Al Gore have speak to why we need to hit one of this target and in reality what that mean be in the next 30 to 40 year we have to make 10 trillion watt or more of new clean energy somehow wind be the second large renewable resource after solar 3600 terawatt more than enough to supply humanity 200 time over the majority of it be in the high altitude above 300 foot where we do not have a technology as yet to get there so this be the dawn of the new age of kite this be we test site on Maui fly across the sky I be now go to show you the first autonomous generation of power by every child favorite plaything as you can tell you need to be a robot to fly this thing for thousand of hour it make you a little nauseous and here we be actually generate about 10 kilowatt so enough to power probably five United States household with a kite not much large than this piano and the real significant thing here be we be develop the control system as do the Wright brother that would enable sustained long duration flight and it do not hurt to do it in a location like this either so this be the equivalent for a kite flier of pee in the snow that be trace you name in the sky and this be where we be actually go so we be beyond the 12 second step and we be work towards megawatt scale machine that fly at 2000 foot and generate ton of clean electricity so you ask how big be that machine well this paper plane would be maybe a oop that would be enough to power you cell phone you Cessna would be 230 killowatt if you would loan I you Gulfstream I will rip its wing off and generate you a megawatt if you give I a 747 I will make six megawatt which be more than the large wind turbine today and the Spruce Goose would be a 15 megawatt wing so that be audacious you say I agree but audacious be what have happen many time before in history this be a refrigerator factory churn out airplane for World War II prior to World War II they be make 1000 plane a year by 1945 they be make 100 000 with this factory and 100 000 plane a year we could make all of America electricity in about 10 year so really this be a story about the audacious plan of young person with this dream there be many of we I be lucky enough to work with 30 of they and I think we need to support all of the dream of the kid out there do this crazy thing thank you applause
