as a clergyman you can imagine how out of place I feel I feel like a fish out of water or maybe a owl out of the air laughter I be preach in San Jose some time ago and my friend Mark Kvamme who help introduce I to this conference bring several ceo and leader of some of the company here in the Silicon Valley to have breakfast with I or I with they and I be so stimulate and have such it be a eye opening experience to hear they talk about the world that be yet to come through technology and science I know that we be near the end of this conference and some of you may be wonder why they have a speaker from the field of religion Richard can answer that because he make that decision but some year ago I be on a elevator in Philadelphia come down I be to address a conference at a hotel and on that elevator a man say I hear Billy Graham be stay in this hotel and another man look in my direction and say yes there he be he be on this elevator with we and this man look I up and down for about 10 second and he say my what a anticlimax laughter I hope that you will not feel that this few moment with I be not a be a anticlimax after all this tremendous talk that you have hear and address which I intend to listen to every one of they but I be on a airplane in the east some year ago and the man sit across the aisle from I be the mayor of Charlotte North Carolina he name be John Belk some of you will probably know he and there be a drunk man on there and he get up out of he seat two or three time and he be make everybody upset by what he be try to do and he be slap the stewardess and pinch she as she go by and everybody be upset with he and finally John Belk say do you know who be sit here and the man say no who he say it be Billy Graham the preacher he say you do not say and he turn to I and he say put she there he say you sermon have certainly help I laughter and I suppose that that be true with thousand of person laughter I know that as you have be peer into the future and as we have hear some of it here tonight I would like to live in that age and see what be go to be but I will not because I be 80 year old this be my eightieth year and I know that my time be brief I have phlebitis at the moment in both leg and that be the reason that I have to have a little help in get up here because I have Parkinson disease in addition to that and some other problem that I will not talk about laughter but this be not the first time that we have have a technological revolution we have have other and there be one that I want to talk about in one generation the nation of the person of Israel have a tremendous and dramatic change that make they a great power in the Near East a man by the name of David come to the throne and King David become one of the great leader of he generation he be a man of tremendous leadership he have the favor of God with he he be a brilliant poet philosopher writer soldier with strategy in battle and conflict that person study even today but about two century before David the Hittites have discover the secret of smelting and processing of iron and slowly that skill spread but they would not allow the Israeli to look into it or to have any but David change all of that and he introduce the Iron Age to Israel and the Bible say that David lay up great store of iron and which archaeologist have find that in present day Palestine there be evidence of that generation now instead of crude tool make of stick and stone Israel now have iron plow and sickle and hoe and military weapon and in the course of one generation Israel be completely change the introduction of iron in some way have a impact a little bit like the microchip have have on we generation and David find that there be many problem that technology could not solve there be many problem still leave and they be still with we and you have not solve they and I have not hear anybody here speak to that how do we solve this three problem that I have like to mention the first one that David see be human evil where do it come from how do we solve it over again and again in the Psalms which Gladstone say be the great book in the world David describe the evil of the human race and yet he say he restore my soul have you ever think about what a contradiction we be on one hand we can probe the deep secret of the universe and dramatically push back the frontier of technology as this conference vividly demonstrate we have see under the sea three mile down or galaxy hundred of billion of year out in the future but on the other hand something be wrong we battleship we soldier be on a frontier now almost ready to go to war with Iraq now what cause this why do we have this war in every generation and in every part of the world and revolution we can not get along with other person even in we own family we find ourselves in the paralyze grip of self destructive habit we can not break racism and injustice and violence sweep we world bring a tragic harvest of heartache and death even the most sophisticated among we seem powerless to break this cycle I would like to see Oracle take up that or some other technological genius work on this how do we change man so that he do not lie and cheat and we newspaper be not fill with story of fraud in business or labor or athletics or wherever the Bible say the problem be within we within we heart and we soul we problem be that we be separate from we creator which we call God and we need to have we soul restore something only God can do Jesus say for out of the heart come evil think murder sexual immorality theft false testimony slander the British philosopher Bertrand Russell be not a religious man but he say it be in we heart that the evil lie and it be from we heart that it must be pluck out Albert Einstein I be just talk to someone when I be speak at Princeton and I meet Mr Einstein he do not have a doctor degree because he say nobody be qualify to give he one laughter but he make this statement he say it be easy to denature plutonium than to denature the evil spirit of man and many of you I be sure have think about that and puzzle over it you have see person take beneficial technological advance such as the internet we have hear about tonight and twist they into something corrupt you have see brilliant person devise computer virus that bring down whole system the Oklahoma City bombing be simple technology horribly use the problem be not technology the problem be the person or person use it King David say that he know the depths of he own soul he could not free himself from personal problem and personal evil that include murder and adultery yet King David seek God forgiveness and say you can restore my soul you see the Bible teach that we be more than a body and a mind we be a soul and there be something inside of we that be beyond we understand that be the part of we that yearn for God or something more than we find in technology you soul be that part of you that yearn for mean in life and which seek for something beyond this life it be the part of you that yearn really for God I find that young person all over the world be search for something they do not know what it be I speak at many university and I have many question and answer period and whether it be Cambridge or Harvard or Oxford I have speak at all of that university I be go to Harvard in about three or four no it be about two month from now to give a lecture and I will be ask the same question that I be ask the last few time I have be there and it will be on this question where do I come from why be I here where be I go what be life all about why be I here even if you have no religious belief there be time when you wonder that there be something else Thomas Edison also say when you see everything that happen in the world of science and in the working of the universe you can not deny that there be a captain on the bridge I remember once I sit beside Mrs Gorbachev at a White House dinner I go to Ambassador Dobrynin whom I know very well and I would be to Russia several time under the Communists and they would give I marvelous freedom that I do not expect and I know Mr Dobrynin very well and I say I be go to sit beside Mrs Gorbachev tonight what shall I talk to she about and he surprise I with the answer he say talk to she about religion and philosophy that be what she be really interested in I be a little bit surprised but that evening that be what we talk about and it be a stimulate conversation and afterward she say you know I be a atheist but I know that there be something up there high than we be the second problem that King David realize he could not solve be the problem of human suffering write the old book in the world be job and he say Man be bear unto trouble as the spark fly upward yes to be sure science have do much to push back certain type of human suffering but I be in a few month I will be 80 year of age I admit that I be very grateful for all the medical advance that have keep I in relatively good health all this year my doctor at the Mayo Clinic urge I not to take this trip out here to this to be here I have not give a talk in nearly four month and when you speak as much as I do three or four time a day you get rusty that be the reason I be use this podium and use this note every time you ever hear I on the television or somewhere I be ad libbing I be not read I never read a address I never read a speech or a talk or a lecture I talk ad lib but tonight I have get some note here so that if I begin to forget which I do sometimes I have get something I can turn to but even here among we most in the most advanced society in the world we have poverty we have family that self destruct friend that betray we unbearable psychological pressure bear down on we I have never meet a person in the world that do not have a problem or a worry why do we suffer it be a age old question that we have not answer yet David again and again say that he would turn to God he say the Lord be my shepherd the final problem that David know he could not solve be death many commentator have say that death be the forbidden subject of we generation most person live as if they be never go to die technology project the myth of control over we mortality we see person on we screen Marilyn Monroe be just as beautiful on the screen as she be in person and we many young person think she be still alive they do not know that she be dead or Clark Gable or whoever it be the old star they come to life and they be they be just as great on that screen as they be in person but death be inevitable I speak some time ago to a joint session of Congress last year and we be meet in that room the statue room about 300 of they be there and I say there be one thing that we have in common in this room all of we together whether Republican or Democrat or whoever I say we be all go to die and we have that in common with all this great man of the past that be stare down at we and it be often difficult for young person to understand that it be difficult for they to understand that they be go to die as the ancient writer of Ecclesiastes write he say there be every activity under heaven there be a time to be bear and there be a time to die I have stand at the deathbed of several famous person whom you would know I have talk to they I have see they in that agonizing moment when they be scare to death and yet a few year early death never cross they mind I talk to a woman this past week whose father be a famous doctor she say he never think of God never talk about God do not believe in God he be a atheist but she say as he come to die he sit up on the side of the bed one day and he ask the nurse if he could see the chaplain and he say for the first time in he life he have think about the inevitable and about God be there a God a few year ago a university student ask I what be the great surprise in you life and I say the great surprise in my life be the brevity of life it pass so fast but it do not need to have to be that way Wernher von Braun in the aftermath of World War II conclude quote science and religion be not antagonist on the contrary they be sister he put it on a personal basis I know Dr von Braun very well and he say speak for myself I can only say that the grandeur of the cosmos serve only to confirm a belief in the certainty of a creator he also say in we search to know God I have come to believe that the life of Jesus Christ should be the focus of we effort and inspiration the reality of this life and he resurrection be the hope of mankind I have do a lot of speak in Germany and in France and in different part of the world 105 country it be be my privilege to speak in and I be invite one day to visit Chancellor Adenauer who be look upon as sort of the founder of modern Germany since the war and he once and he say to I he say young man he say do you believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ and I say Sir I do he say so do I he say when I leave office I be go to spend my time write a book on why Jesus Christ rise again and why it be so important to believe that in one of he play Alexander Solzhenitsyn depict a man die who say to that gather around he bed the moment when it be terrible to feel regret be when one be die how should one live in order not to feel regret when one be die Blaise Pascal ask exactly that question in seventeenth century France Pascal have be call the architect of modern civilization he be a brilliant scientist at the frontier of mathematics even as a teenager he be view by many as the founder of the probability theory and a creator of the first model of a computer and of course you be all familiar with the computer language name for he Pascal explore in depth we human dilemma of evil suffering and death he be astounded at the phenomenon we have be consider that person can achieve extraordinary height in science the art and human enterprise yet they also be full of anger hypocrisy and have and self hatred pascal see we as a remarkable mixture of genius and self delusion on November 23 1654 pascal have a profound religious experience he write in he journal this word I submit myself absolutely to Jesus Christ my redeemer a French historian say two century later seldom have so mighty a intellect submit with such humility to the authority of Jesus Christ Pascal come to believe not only the love and the grace of God could bring we back into harmony but he believe that he own sin and failure could be forgive and that when he die he would go to a place call heaven he experience it in a way that go beyond scientific observation and reason it be he who pen the well known word the heart have its reason which reason know not of equally well know be Pascal Wager essentially he say this if you bet on God and open yourself to he love you lose nothing even if you be wrong but if instead you bet that there be no God then you can lose it all in this life and the life to come for Pascal scientific knowledge pale beside the knowledge of God the knowledge of God be far beyond anything that ever cross he mind he be ready to face he when he die at the age of 39 King David live to be 70 a long time in he era yet he too have to face death and he write this word even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for you be with I this be David answer to three dilemma of evil suffering and death it can be yours as well as you seek the live God and allow he to fill you life and give you hope for the future when I be 17 year of age I be bear and rear on a farm in North Carolina I milk cow every morning and I have to milk the same cow every evening when I come home from school and there be 20 of they that I have that I be responsible for and I work on the farm and try to keep up with my study I do not make good grade in high school I do not make they in college until something happen in my heart one day I be face face to face with Christ he say I be the way the truth and the life can you imagine that I be the truth I be the embodiment of all truth he be a liar or he be insane or he be what he claim to be which be he I have to make that decision I could not prove it I could not take it to a laboratory and experiment with it but by faith I say I believe he and he come into my heart and change my life and now I be ready when I hear that call to go into the presence of God thank you and God bless all of you applause thank you for the privilege it be great Richard Wurman you do it thanks applause
