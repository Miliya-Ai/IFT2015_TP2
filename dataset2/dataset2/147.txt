Chris Anderson welcome to TED Richard Branson thank you very much the first TED have be great CA have you meet anyone interesting RB well the nice thing about TED be everybody interesting I be very glad to see Goldie Hawn because I have a apology to make to she I would have dinner with she about two year ago and I would she have this big wedding ring and I put it on my finger and I could not get it off and I go home to my wife that night and she want to know why I have another woman big massive big wedding ring on my finger and anyway the next morning we have to go along to the jeweler and get it cut off so laughter so apology to Goldie CA that be pretty good so we be go to put up some slide of some of you company here you have start one or two in you time so you know Virgin Atlantic Virgin Records I guess it all start with a magazine call Student and then yes all this other one as well I mean how do you do this RB I read all this sort of TED instruction you must not talk about you own business and this and now you ask I so I suppose you be not go to be able to kick I off the stage since you ask the question laughter ca it depend what the answer be though RB No I mean I think I learn early on that if you can run one company you can really run any company I mean company be all about find the right person inspire that person you know draw out the good in person and I just love learning and I be incredibly inquisitive and I love take on you know the status quo and try to turn it upside down so I have see life as one long learning process and if I see you know if I fly on somebody else airline and find the experience be not a pleasant one which it be not 21 year ago then I would think well you know maybe I can create the kind of airline that I have like to fly on and so you know so get one secondhand 747 from Boeing and give it a go CA well that be a bizarre thing because you make this move that a lot of person advise you be crazy and in fact in a way it almost take down you empire at one point I have a conversation with one of the investment banker who at the time when you basically sell Virgin Records and invest heavily in Virgin Atlantic and he view be that you be trade you know the world fourth big record company for the twenty fifth big airline and that you be out of you mind why do you do that RB well I think that there be a very thin dividing line between success and failure and I think if you start a business without financial backing you be likely to go the wrong side of that divide line we have we be be attack by British Airways they be try to put we airline out of business and they launch what be become know as the dirty trick campaign and I realize that the whole empire be likely to come crash down unless I chip in a chip and in order to protect the job of the person who work for the airline and protect the job of the person who work for the record company I have to sell the family jewelry to protect the airline ca Post Napster you be look like a bit of a genius actually for that as well RB yeah as it turn out it prove to be the right move but yeah it be sad at the time but we move on CA now you use the virgin brand a lot and it seem like you be get synergy from one thing to the other what do the brand stand for in you head RB well I like to think it stand for quality that you know if somebody come across a virgin company they can they be quality Richard come on now everyone say quality Spirit RB No but I be go to move on this we have a lot of fun and I think the person who work for it enjoy it as I say we go in and shake up other industry and I think you know we do it differently and I think that industry be not quite the same as a result of Virgin attack the market ca I mean there be a few launch you have do where the brand maybe have not work quite as well I mean virgin Brides what happen there laughter RB we could not find any customer laughter applause ca I be actually also curious why I think you miss a opportunity with you condom launch you call it Mates I mean could not you have use the virgin brand for that as well be not virgin no long or something RB again we may have have problem find customer I mean we have often when you launch a company and you get customer complaint you know you can deal with they but about three month after the launch of the condom company I have a letter a complaint and I sit down and write a long letter back to this lady apologize profusely but obviously there be not a lot I could do about it and then six month later or nine month after the problem have take I get this delightful letter with a picture of the baby ask if I would be godfather which I become so it all work out well CA really you should have bring a picture that be wonderful RB I should have CA so just help we with some of the number I mean what be the number on this I mean how big be the group overall how much what be the total revenue RB it be about 25 billion dollar now in total CA and how many employee RB about 55 000 ca so you have be photograph in various way at various time and never worry about put you dignity on the line or anything like that what be that be that real RB yeah we be launch a megastore in Los Angeles I think no I mean I think CA but be that you hair RB No CA what be that one RB Dropping in for tea ca ok laughter RB Ah that be quite fun that be a wonderful car boat in which CA oh that car that we actually we it be a tedster event there I think be that could you still pause on that one actually for a minute laughter RB it be a tough job be not it can I mean it be a tough job laughter when I first come to America I use to try this with employee as well and they kind of they have this different rule over here it be very strange RB I know I have the lawyer say you must not do thing like that but CA I mean speak of which tell we about RB Pammy we launch you know mistakenly think we could take on Coca Cola and we launch a cola bottle call the Pammy and it be shape a bit like Pamela Anderson but the trouble be it keep on tip over but laughter ca design by Philippe Starck perhaps RB of course CA so we will just run a couple more picture here virgin Brides very nice and ok so stop there this be you have some award I think RB yeah well 25 year early we have launch the sex pistol God Save the Queen and I would certainly never expect that 25 year later that she have actually knight we but somehow she must have have a forgetful memory I think CA well God save she and you get you just reward do you like to be call Sir Richard or how RB nobody ever call I Sir Richard occasionally in America I hear person say Sir Richard and think there be some shakespearean play take place but nowhere else anyway CA ok so can you use you knighthood for anything or be it just RB No I suppose if you be have problem get a booking in a restaurant or something that might be worth use it CA you know it be not Richard Branson it be Sir Richard Branson RB I will go get the secretary to use it CA ok so let look at the space thing I think with we we have get a video that show what you be up to and virgin Galactic up in the air video so that be the Bert Rutan design spaceship RB yeah it will be ready in well ready in 12 month and then we do 12 month extensive testing and then 24 month from now person will be able to take a ride into space ca so this interior be Philippe Starcke design RB Philippe have do the yeah quite a bit of it the logo and he be build the space station in New Mexico and basically he be just take a eye and the space station will be one giant eye so when you be in space you ought to be able to see this massive eye look up at you and when you land you will be able to go back into this giant eye but he be a absolute genius when it come to design CA but you do not have he design the engine RB Philippe be quite erratic so I think that he would not be the good person to design the engine no ca he give a wonderful talk here two day ago RB yeah no he be a CA well some person find it wonderful some person find it completely bizarre but I personally find it wonderful RB he be a wonderful enthusiast which be why I love he but CA so now you have always have this exploration bug in you have you ever regret that RB many time I mean I think with the ballooning and boat expedition we have do in the past well I get pull out of the sea I think six time by helicopter so and each time I do not expect to come home to tell the tale so in that moment you certainly wonder what you be do up there or CA what be the close you get to when do you think this be it I might be on my way out RB well I think the balloon adventure be each one be each one actually I think we come close and I mean first of all we nobody have actually cross the Atlantic in a hot air balloon before so we have to build a hot air balloon that be capable of fly in the jet stream and we be not quite sure when a balloon actually get into the jet stream whether it would actually survive the 200 220 mile a hour wind that you can find up there and so just the initial lift off from Sugarloaf to cross the Atlantic as we be push into the jet stream this enormous balloon the top of the balloon end up go at a couple of hundred mile a hour the capsule that we be in at the bottom be go at maybe two mile a hour and it just take off and it be like hold onto a thousand horse and we be just cross every finger pray that the balloon would hold together which fortunately it do but the end of all that balloon trip be you know something seem to go wrong every time and on that particular occasion the more experienced balloonist who be with I jump and leave I hold on for dear life laughter ca do he tell you to jump or he just say I be out of here and RB No he tell I jump but once he weight have go the balloon just shoot up to 12 000 foot and I can and you inspire a Ian McEwan novel I think with that RB yeah no I put on my oxygen mask and stand on top of the balloon with my parachute look at the swirl cloud below try to pluck up my courage to jump into the North Sea which and it be a very very very lonely few moment but anyway we manage to survive it CA do you jump or it come down in the end RB well I know I have about half a hour fuel leave and I also know that the chance be that if I jump I would only have a couple of minute of life leave so I climb back into the capsule and just desperately try to make sure that I be make the right decision and write some note to my family and then climb back up again look down at that cloud again climb back into the capsule again and then finally just think there be a good way I have get you know this enormous balloon above I it be the big parachute ever why not use it and so I manage to fly the balloon down through the cloud and about 50 foot before I hit the sea throw myself over and the balloon hit the sea and go shoot back up to 10 000 foot without I but it be a wonderful feeling be in that water and ca what do you write to you family RB just what you would do in a situation like that just I love you very much and I would already write they a letter before go on this trip which just in case anything have happen but fortunately they never have to use it can you company have have incredible pr value out of this heroics the year and until I stop look at the poll you be sort of regard as this great hero in the U K and elsewhere and cynic might say you know this be just a smart business guy do what it take to execute he particular style of marketing how much be the pr value part of this RB Well of course the pr expert say that as a airline owner the last thing you should be do be head off in balloon and boat and crash into the seas laughter ca they have a point Richard RB in fact I think we airline take a full page ad at the time say you know come on Richard there be good way of cross the atlantic laughter ca to do all this you must have be a genius from the get go right RB well I will not contradict that laughter ca ok this be not exactly hardball ok do not be not you just terrible at school RB I be dyslexic I have no understanding of schoolwork whatsoever I certainly would have fail iq test and it be one of the reason I leave school when I be 15 year old and if I if I be not interested in something I do not grasp it as somebody who be dyslexic you also have some quite bizarre situation I mean for instance I have have to you know I have be run the large group of private company in Europe but have not be able to know the difference between net and gross and so the board meeting have be fascinating laughter and so it be like good news or bad news and generally the person would say oh well that be bad news CA but just to clarify the 25 billion dollar be gross right that be gross laughter RB well I hope it be net actually have laughter I have get it right CA No trust I it be gross laughter RB so when I turn 50 somebody take I outside the boardroom and say look Richard here be a let I draw on a diagram here be a net in the sea and the fish have be pull from the sea into this net and that be the profit you have get leave over in this little net everything else be eat and I finally work it all out laughter applause CA but I mean at school so as well as be you know do pretty miserably academically but you be also the captain of the cricket and football team so you be kind of a you be a natural leader but just a bit of a be you a rebel then or how would you RB yeah I think I be a bit of a maverick and but I and I be yeah I be fortunately good at sport and so at least I have something to excel at at school ca and some bizarre thing happen just early in you life I mean there be the story about you mother allegedly dump you in a field aged four and say ok walk home do this really happen RB she be you know she feel that we need to stand on we own two foot from a early age so she do thing to we which now she would be arrest for such as push we out of the car and tell we to find we own way to Granny about five mile before we actually get there and make we go on wonderful long bike ride and we be never allow to watch television and the like CA but be there a risk here I mean there be a lot of person in the room who be wealthy and they have get kid and we have get this dilemma about how you bring they up do you look at the current generation of kid come up and think they be too coddle they do not know what they have get we be go to raise a generation of privileged RB No I think if you be bring up kid you just want to smother they with love and praise and enthusiasm so I do not think you can mollycoddle you kid too much really CA you do not turn out too bad I have to say I be you headmaster say to you I mean he find you kind of a enigma at you school he say you be either go to be a millionaire or go to prison and I be not sure which which of that happen first laughter RB well I have do both I think I go to prison first I be actually prosecute under two quite ancient act in the U K I be prosecute under the 1889 venereal Diseases Act and the 1916 Indecent Advertisements Act on the first occasion for mention the word venereal disease in public which we have a center where we would help young person who have problem and one of the problem young person have be venereal disease and there be a ancient law that say you can not actually mention the word venereal disease or print it in public so the police knock on the door and tell we they be go to arrest we if we carry on mention the word venereal disease we change it to social disease and person come along with acne and spot but nobody come with VD any more so we put it back to VD and promptly get arrest and then subsequently never mind the Bollocks here be the sex pistol the word bollock the police decide be a rude word and so we be arrest for use the word bollock on the sex pistol album and John Mortimer the playwright defend we and he ask if I could find a linguistics expert to come up with a different definition of the word bollock and so I ring up Nottingham University and I ask to talk to the professor of linguistics and he say look bollock be not a have nothing to do with ball whatsoever it be actually a nickname give to priest in the eighteenth century laughter and he go furthermore I be a priest myself and so I say would you mind come to the court and he say he would be delighted and I say and he say would you like I to wear my dog collar and I say yes definitely please laughter ca that be great RB so we key witness argue that it be actually never mind the Priest here be the sex pistol laughter and the judge find we reluctantly find we not guilty so laughter ca that be outrageous applause so seriously be there a dark side a lot of person would say there be no way that someone could put together this incredible collection of business without knife a few person in the back you know do some ugly thing you have be accuse of be ruthless there be a nasty biography write about you by someone be any of it true be there a element of truth in it RB I do not actually think that the stereotype of a businessperson tread all over person to get to the top generally speak work I think if you treat person well person will come back and come back for more and I think all you have in life be you reputation and it be a very small world and I actually think that the good way of become a successful business leader be deal with person fairly and well and I like to think that be how we run Virgin CA and what about the person who love you and who see you spend you keep get catch up in this new project but it almost feel like you be addict to launch new stuff you get excite by a idea and kapow I mean do you think about life balance how do you family feel about each time you step into something big and new RB I also believe that be a father incredibly important so from the time the kid be very young you know when they go on holiday I go on holiday with they and so we spend a very good sort of three month away together yes I will you know be in touch we be very lucky we have this tiny little island in the Caribbean and we can so I can take they there and we can bring friend and we can play together but I can also keep in touch with what be go on CA you start talk in recent year about this term capitalist philanthropy what be that RB capitalism have be prove to be a system that work you know the alternative communism have not work but the problem with capitalism be extreme wealth end up in the hand of a few person and therefore extreme responsibility I think go with that wealth and I think it be important that the individual who be in that fortunate position do not end up compete for big and big boat and big and big car but you know use that money to either create new job or to tackle issue around the world CA and what be the issue that you worry about most care most about want to turn you resource toward RB well there be I mean there be a lot of issue I mean global warming certainly be a massive threat to mankind and we be put a lot of time and energy into a try to come up with alternative fuel and b you know we just launch this prize which be really a prize in case we do not get a answer on alternative fuel in case we do not actually manage to get the carbon emission cut down quickly and in case we go through the tip point we need to try to encourage person to come up with a way of extract carbon out of the Earth atmosphere and we just you know there be not really person work on that before so we want person to try to all the good brain in the world to start think about that and also to try to extract the methane out of the Earth atmosphere as well and actually we have have about 15 000 person fill in the form say they want to give it a go and so we only need one so we be hopeful ca and you be also work in Africa on a couple of project RB yes I mean we have get we be set up something call the war room which be maybe the wrong word we be try to maybe we will change it but anyway it be a war room to try to coordinate all the attack that be go on in Africa all the different social problem in Africa and try to look at well practice so for instance there be a doctor in Africa that be find that if you give a mother antiretroviral drug at 24 week when she be pregnant that the baby will not have HIV when it be bear and so disseminate that information to around the rest of Africa be important ca the war room sound it sound powerful and dramatic and be there a risk that the kind of the business hero of the West get so excited about I mean they be use to have a idea get stuff do and they believe profoundly in they ability to make a difference in the world be there a risk that we go to place like Africa and say we have get to fix this problem and we can do it I have get all this billion of dollar you know da da da here be the big idea and kind of take a much more complex situation and actually end up make a mess of it do you worry about that RB Well first of all on this particular situation we be actually we be work with the government on it I mean Thabo Mbeki have he problem with accept HIV and AIDS be related but this be a way I think of he tackle this problem and instead of the world criticize he it be a way of work with he with he government it be important that if person do go to Africa and do try to help they do not just go in there and then leave after a few year it be get to be consistent but I think business leader can bring they entrepreneurial know how and help government approach thing slightly differently for instance we be set up clinic in Africa where we be go to be give free antiretroviral drug free tb treatment and free malaria treatment but we be also try to make they self sustain clinic so that person pay for some other aspect can I mean a lot of cynic say about someone like yourself or Bill Gates or whatever that this be really be it be almost drive by some sort of desire again you know for the right image for guilt avoidance and not like a real philanthropic instinct what would you say to they RB well I think that everybody person do thing for a whole variety of different reason and I think that you know when I be on I deathbed I will want to feel that I have make a difference to other person life and that may be a selfish thing to think but it be the way I have be bring up I think if I be in a position to radically change other person life for the good I should do so CA how old be you RB I be 56 CA I mean the psychologist Erik Erikson say that as I understand he and I be a total amateur but that during 30 40 person be drive by this desire to grow and that be where they get they fulfillment 50 60 the mode of operation shift more to the quest for wisdom and a search for legacy I mean it seem like you be still a little bit in the growth phase you be still do this incredible new plan how much do you think about legacy and what would you like you legacy to be RB I do not think I think too much about legacy I mean I like to you know my grandmother live to 101 so hopefully I have get another 30 or 40 year to go no I just want to live life to its full you know if I can make a difference I hope to be able to make a difference and I think one of the positive thing at the moment be you have get Sergey and Larry from Google for instance who be good friend and thank God you have get two person who genuinely care about the world and with that kind of wealth if they have that kind of wealth and they do not care about the world it would be very worrying and you know they be go to make a hell of a difference to the world and I think it be important that person in that kind of position do make a difference CA Well Richard when I be start off in business I know nothing about it and I also be sort of I think that business person be suppose to just be ruthless and that that be the only way you could have a chance of succeed and you actually do inspire I I look at you I think well he be make it maybe there be a different way so I would like to thank you for that inspiration and for come to TED today thank you thank you so much applause
