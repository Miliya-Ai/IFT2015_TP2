I study ant and that be because I like to think about how organization work and in particular how the simple part of organization interact to create the behavior of the whole organization so ant colony be a good example of a organization like that and there be many other the web be one there be many biological system like that brain cell develop embryo there be about 10 000 species of ant they all live in colony consist of one or a few queen and then all the ant you see walk around be sterile female worker and all ant colony have in common that there be no central control nobody tell anybody what to do the queen just lay the egg there be no management no ant direct the behavior of any other ant and I try to figure out how that work and I have be work for the past 20 year on a population of seed eat ant in southeastern Arizona here be my study site this be really a picture of ant and the rabbit just happen to be there and this ant be call harvester ant because they eat seed this be the nest of the mature colony and there be the nest entrance and they forage maybe for about 20 meter away gather up the seed and bring they back to the nest and store they and every year I go there and make a map of my study site this be just a road and it be not very big it be about 250 meter on one side 400 on the other and every colony have a name which be a number which be paint on a rock and I go there every year and look for all the colony that be alive the year before and figure out which one have die and put all the new one on the map and by do this I know how old they all be and because of that I have be able to study how they behavior change as the colony get old and large so I want to tell you about the life cycle of a colony ant never make more ant colony make more colony and they do that by each year send out the reproductive that be the one with wing on a mating flight so every year on the same day and it be a mystery exactly how that happen each colony send out its virgin unmated queen with wing and the male and they all fly to a common place and they mate and this show a recently virgin queen here be she wing and she be in the process of mating with this male and there be another male on top wait he turn often the queen mate more than once and after that the male all die that be it for they laughter and then the newly mate queen fly off somewhere drop they wing dig a hole and go into that hole and start lay egg and they will live for 15 or 20 year continue to lay egg use the sperm from that original mating so the queen go down in there she lay egg she feed the larva so a ant start as a egg then it be a larva she feed the larva by regurgitate from she fat reserve then as soon as the ant the first group of ant emerge they be larva then they be pupa then they come out as adult ant they go out they get the food they dig the nest and the queen never come out again so this be a one year old colony this happen to be 536 there be the nest entrance there be a pencil for scale so this be the colony find by a queen the previous summer this be a three year old colony there be the nest entrance there be a pencil for scale they make a midden a pile of refuse mostly the husk of the seed that they eat this be a five year old colony this be the nest entrance here be a pencil for scale this be about as big as they get about a meter across and then this be how colony size and number of worker ant change so this be about 10 000 worker ant change as a function of colony age in year so it start out with zero ant just the founding queen and it grow to a size of about 10 or 12 thousand ant when the colony be five and it stay that size until the queen die and there be nobody to make more ant when she be about 15 or 20 year old and it be when they reach this stable size in number of ant that they start to reproduce that be to send more winged queen and male to that year mating flight and I know how colony size change as a function of colony age because I have dig up colony of known age and count all the ant laughter so that be not the most fun part of this research although it be interesting laughter really the question that I think about with this ant be what I call task allocation that be not just how be the colony organize but how do it change what it be do how be it that the colony manage to adjust the number of worker perform each task as condition change so thing happen to a ant colony when it rain in the summer it flood in the desert there be a lot of damage to the nest and extra ant be need to clean up that mess when extra food become available and this be what everybody know about picnic then extra ant be allocate to collect the food so with nobody tell anybody what to do how be it that the colony manage to adjust the number of worker perform each task and that be the process that I call task allocation and in harvester ant I divide the task of the ant I see just outside the nest into this four category where a ant be forage when it be out along the forage trail search for food or bring food back the patroller that be suppose to be a magnifying glass be a interesting group that go out early in the morning before the forager be active they somehow choose the direction that the forager will go and by come back just by make it back they tell the forager that it be safe to go out then the nest maintenance worker work inside the nest and I want to say that the nest look a lot like Bill Lishman house that be that there be chamber inside they line the wall of the chamber with moist soil and it dry to a kind of a adobe like surface in it it also look very similar to some of the cave dwelling of the hopi person that be in that area and the nest maintenance worker do that inside the nest and then they come out of the nest carry bit of dry soil in they mandible so you see the nest maintenance worker come out with a bit of sand put it down turn around and go back in and finally the midden worker put some kind of territorial chemical in the garbage so what you see the midden worker do be make a pile of refuse on one day it will all be here and then the next day they will move it over there and then they will move it back so that be what the midden worker do and this four group be just the ant outside the nest so that be only about 25 percent of the colony and they be the old ant so a ant start out somewhere near the queen and when we dig up nest we find they be about as deep as the colony be wide so about a meter deep for the big old nest and then there be another long tunnel and a chamber where we often find the queen after eight hour of hack away at the rock with pickax I do not think that chamber have evolve because of I and my backhoe and my crew of student with pickax but instead because when there be flood occasionally the colony have to go down deep so there be this whole network of chamber the queen in there somewhere she just lay egg there be the larva and they consume most of the food and this be true of most ant that the ant you see walk around do not do much eating they bring it back and feed it to the larva when the forager come in with food they just drop it into the upper chamber and other ant come up from below get the food bring it back husk the seed and pile they up there be nest maintenance worker work throughout the nest and curiously and interestingly it look as though at any time about half the ant in the colony be just do nothing so despite what it say in the Bible about you know look to the ant thou sluggard in fact you could think of that ant as reserve that be to say if something happen and I have never see anything like this happen but I have only be look for 20 year if something happen they might all come out if they be need but in fact mostly they be just hang around in there and I think it be a very interesting question what be there about the way the colony be organize that might give some function to a reserve of ant who be do nothing and they sort of stand as a buffer in between the ant work deep inside the nest and the ant work outside and if you mark ant that be work outside and dig up a colony you never see they deep down so what be happen be that the ant work inside the nest when they be young they somehow get into this reserve and then eventually they get recruit to join this exterior workforce and once they belong to the ant that work outside they never go back down now ant most ant include this do not see very well they have eye they can distinguish between light and dark but they mostly work by smell so just to reinforce that what you might have think about ant queen be not true you know even if the queen do have the intelligence to send chemical message through this whole network of chamber to tell the ant outside what to do there be no way that such message could make it in time to see the shift in the allocation of worker that we actually see outside the nest so that be one way that we know the queen be not direct the behavior of the colony so when I first set out to work on task allocation my first question be what be the relationship between the ant do different task do it matter to the forager what the nest maintenance worker be do do it matter to the midden worker what the patroller be do and I be work in the context of a view of ant colony in which each ant be somehow dedicate to its task from birth and sort of perform independently of the other know its place on the assembly line and instead I want to ask how be the different task group interdependent so I do experiment where I change one thing so for example I create more work for the nest maintenance worker by put out a pile of toothpick near the nest entrance early in the morning when the nest maintenance worker be first active this be what it look like about 20 minute late here it be about 40 minute late and the nest maintenance worker just take all the toothpick to the outer edge of the nest mound and leave they there and what I want to know be ok here be a situation where extra nest maintenance worker be recruit be this go to have any effect on the worker perform other task then we repeat all that experiment with the ant mark so here be some blue nest maintenance worker and lately we have get more sophisticated and we have this three color system and we can mark they individually so we know which ant be which we start out with model airplane paint and then we find this wonderful little Japanese marker and they work really well and so just to summarize the result well it turn out that yes the different task be interdependent so if I change the number perform one task it change the number perform another so for example if I make a mess that the nest maintenance worker have to clean up then I see few ant out forage and this be true for all the pair wise combination of task and the second result which be surprising to a lot of person be that ant actually switch task the same ant do not do the same task over and over its whole life so for example if I put out extra food everybody else the midden worker stop do midden work and go get the food they become forager the nest maintenance worker become forager the patroller become forager but not every transition be possible and this show how it work like I just say if there be more food to collect the patroller the midden worker the nest maintenance worker will all change to forage if there be more patrol to do so I create a disturbance so extra patroller be need the nest maintenance worker will switch to patrol but if more nest maintenance work be need for example if I put out a bunch of toothpick then nobody will ever switch back to nest maintenance they have to get nest maintenance worker from inside the nest so forage act as a sink and the ant inside the nest act as a source and finally it look like each ant be decide moment to moment whether to be active or not so for example when there be extra nest maintenance work to do it be not that the forager switch over I know that they do not do that but the forager somehow decide not to come out and here be the most intriguing result the task allocation this process change with colony age and it change like this when I do this experiment with old colony so one that be five year or old they be much more consistent from one time to another and much more homeostatic the bad thing get the more I hassle they the more they act like undisturbed colony whereas the young small colony the two year old colony of just 2 000 ant be much more variable and the amazing thing about this be that a ant live only a year it could be this year or this year so the ant in the old colony that seem to be more stable be not any old than the ant in the young colony it be not due to the experience of old wise ant instead something about the organization must be change as the colony get old and the obvious thing that be change be its size so since I have have this result I have spend a lot of time try to figure out what kind of decision rule very simple local probably olfactory chemical rule could a ant could be use since no ant can assess the global situation that would have the outcome that I see this predictable dynamics in who do what task and it would change as the colony get large and what I have find out be that ant be use a network of antennal contact so anybody who be ever look at ant have see they touch antennae they smell with they antennae when one ant touch another it be smell it and it can tell for example whether the other ant be a nest mate because ant cover themselves and each other through groom with a layer of grease which carry a colony specific odor and what we be learn be that a ant use the pattern of its antennal contact the rate at which it meet ant of other task in decide what to do and so what the message be be not any message that they transmit from one ant to another but the pattern the pattern itself be the message and I will tell you a little bit more about that but first you might be wonder how be it that a ant can tell for example I be a forager I expect to meet another forager every so often but if instead I start to meet a high number of nest maintenance worker I be less likely to forage so it have to know the difference between a forager and a nest maintenance worker and we have learn that in this species and I suspect in other as well this hydrocarbon this layer of grease on the outside of ant be different as ant perform different task and we have do experiment that show that that be because the long a ant stay outside the more this simple hydrocarbon on its surface change and so they come to smell different by do different task and they can use that task specific odor in cuticular hydrocarbon they can use that in they brief antennal contact to somehow keep track of the rate at which they be meet ant of certain task and we have just recently demonstrate this by put extract of hydrocarbon on little glass bead and drop the bead gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate and it turn out that ant will respond to the right rate of contact with a glass bead with hydrocarbon extract on it as they would to contact with real ant so I want now to show you a bit of film and this will start out first of all show you the nest entrance so the idea be that ant be come in and out of the nest entrance they have go out to do different task and the rate at which they meet as they come in and out of the nest entrance determine or influence each ant decision about whether to go out and which task to perform this be take through a fiber optics microscope it be down inside the nest in the beginning you see the ant just kind of engage with the fiber optics microscope but the idea be that the ant be in there and each ant be experience a certain flow of ant past it a stream of contact with other ant and the pattern of this interaction determine whether the ant come back out and what it do when it come back out you can also see this in the ant just outside the nest entrance like this each ant then as it come back in be contact other ant and the ant that be wait just inside the nest entrance to decide whether to go out on they next trip be contact the ant come in so what be interesting about this system be that it be messy it be variable it be noisy and in particular in two way the first be that the experience of the ant of each ant can not be very predictable because the rate at which ant come back depend on all the little thing that happen to a ant as it go out and do its task outside and the second thing be that a ant ability to assess this pattern must be very crude because no ant can do any sophisticated counting so we do a lot of simulation and modeling and also experimental work to try to figure out how that two kind of noise combine to in the aggregate produce the predictable behavior of ant colony again I do not want to say that this kind of haphazard pattern of interaction produce a factory that work with the precision and efficiency of clockwork in fact if you watch ant at all you end up try to help they because they never seem to be do anything exactly the way that you think that they ought to be do it so it be not really that out of this haphazard contact perfection arise but it work pretty well ant have be around for several hundred million year they cover the earth except for Antarctica something that they be do be clearly successful enough that this pattern of haphazard contact in the aggregate produce something that allow ant to make a lot more ant and one of the thing that we be study be how natural selection might be act now to shape this use of interaction pattern this network of interaction pattern to perhaps increase the forage efficiency of ant colony so the one thing though that I want you to remember about this be that this pattern of interaction be something that you have expect to be closely connect to colony size the simple idea be that when a ant be in a small colony and a ant in a large colony can use the same rule like I expect to meet another forager every three second but in a small colony it be likely to meet few forager just because there be few other forager there to meet so this be the kind of rule that as the colony develop and get old and large will produce different behavior in a old colony and a small young one thank you applause
