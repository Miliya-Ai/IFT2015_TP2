several year ago here at TED Peter Skillman introduce a design challenge call the marshmallow challenge and the idea pretty simple team of four have to build the tall free standing structure out of 20 stick of spaghetti one yard of tape one yard of string and a marshmallow the marshmallow have to be on top and though it seem really simple it be actually pretty hard because it force person to collaborate very quickly and so I think this be a interesting idea and I incorporate it into a design workshop and it be a huge success and since then I have conduct about 70 design workshop across the world with student and designer and architect even the cto of the Fortune 50 and there be something about this exercise that reveal very deep lesson about the nature of collaboration and I would like to share some of they with you so normally most person begin by orient themselves to the task they talk about it they figure out what it be go to look like they jockey for power then they spend some time plan organizing they sketch and they lay out spaghetti they spend the majority of they time assemble the stick into ever grow structure and then finally just as they be run out of time someone take out the marshmallow and then they gingerly put it on top and then they stand back and ta da they admire they work but what really happen most of the time be that the ta da turn into a uh oh because the weight of the marshmallow cause the entire structure to buckle and to collapse so there be a number of person who have a lot more uh oh moment than other and among the bad be recent graduate of business school laughter they lie they cheat they get distracted and they produce really lame structure and of course there be team that have a lot more ta da structure and among the good be recent graduate of kindergarten laughter and it be pretty amazing as Peter tell we not only do they produce the tall structure but they be the most interesting structure of they all so the question you want to ask be how come why what be it about they and Peter like to say that none of the kid spend any time try to be ceo of spaghetti Inc Right they do not spend time jockeying for power but there be another reason as well and the reason be that business student be train to find the single right plan right and then they execute on it and then what happen be when they put the marshmallow on the top they run out of time and what happen it be a crisis sound familiar right what kindergartener do differently be that they start with the marshmallow and they build prototype successive prototype always keep the marshmallow on top so they have multiple time to fix when they build prototype along the way designer recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process and with each version kid get instant feedback about what work and what do not work so the capacity to play in prototype be really essential but let look at how different team perform so the average for most person be around 20 inch business school student about half of that lawyer a little good but not much good than that kindergartener good than most adult who do the very good architect and engineer thankfully laughter thirty nine inch be the tall structure I have see and why be it because they understand triangle and self reinforce geometrical pattern be the key to build stable structure so ceo a little bit good than average but here be where it get interesting if you put you put a executive admin on the team they get significantly good laughter it be incredible you know you look around you go oh that team be go to win you can just tell beforehand and why be that because they have special skill of facilitation they manage the process they understand the process and any team who manage and pay close attention to work will significantly improve the team performance Specialized skill and facilitation skill be the combination that lead to strong success if you have 10 team that typically perform you will get maybe six or so that have stand structure and I try something interesting I think let up the ante once so I offer a 10 000 dollar prize of software to the win team so what do you think happen to this design student what be the result here be what happen not one team have a standing structure if anyone have build say a one inch structure they would have take home the prize so be not that interesting that high stake have a strong impact we do the exercise again with the same student what do you think happen then so now they understand the value of prototype so the same team go from be the very bad to be among the very good they produce the tall structure in the least amount of time so there be deep lesson for we about the nature of incentive and success so you might ask why would anyone actually spend time write a marshmallow challenge and the reason be I help create digital tool and process to help team build car and video game and visual effect and what the marshmallow challenge do be it help they identify the hidden assumption because frankly every project have its own marshmallow do not it the challenge provide a share experience a common language a common stance to build the right prototype and so this be the value of the experience of this so simple exercise and that of you who be interested may want to go to MarshmallowChallenge com it be a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallow there be step by step instruction on this there be crazy example from around the world of how person tweak and adjust the system there be world record that be on this as well and the fundamental lesson I believe be that design truly be a contact sport it demand that we bring all of we sens to the task and that we apply the very good of we think we feeling and we do to the challenge that we have at hand and sometimes a little prototype of this experience be all that it take to turn we from a uh oh moment to a ta da moment and that can make a big difference thank you very much applause
