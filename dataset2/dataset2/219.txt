you know one of the thing that I have like to say upfront be that I be really here by accident and what I mean not at TED that I be at this point in my life truly my set of circumstance I would truly consider a accident but what I would like to talk to you about today be perhaps a way in which we could use technology to make that accident happen often because I really think when I look back at how I actually end up in this accident technology play a big role in that so what I would like to do today be tell you a little bit about myself because I would like to put in context what I be go to tell you and I think you will see why the two great passion in my life today be child and education and once I put that in context I would like to tell you a little bit about technology why I believe technology be a tremendous enabler a very powerful tool to help address some of this challenge then about the initiative that Chris mention that we decide to launch at AMD that we call 50x15 and then I will come back to the beginning and tell you a little bit more hopefully convince you that I believe that in today world it be really important for business leader not only to have a idea of what they business be all about but to have a passion for something that be meaningful so with that in mind first of all let I tell you I be one of five child I be the old the other four be woman so I grow up in a family of woman I learn a lot about how to deal with that part of the world laughter and as you can imagine if you can picture this I be bear in a very small village in Mexico in unfortunately very poor surroundings and my parent do not have a college education but I be fortunate to be able to have one and so be my four sister that kind of tell you a little bit of a idea of the emphasis that my parent place on education my parent be fanatic about learn and I will come back to that a little bit late but one of the thing that expose I early to learning and a tremendous curiosity that be instil in I as a child be through a technology which be on the screen be a Victrola my father find that in a junkyard and be able to repair it and make it work and somehow to this day I frankly do not know how he be so aware of what be go on in the world but by invite I to sit down with he when I be only a few year old and play record in this Victrola by Mozart and he would tell I how Mozart be the most romantic of all the classic composer ever and how Claire de Lune which be one of he favorite be a real exposure to I to classical music he explain to I about Johann Strauss and how he create the waltz that become so famous in the world and would tell I a little bit about history too when he have play the 1812 overture by Tchaikovsky on this little Victrola and he would tell I about Russia and all the thing that be happen in Russia at that time and why this music in some way represent a little bit of that history and even as a child he be able to instill in I a lot of curiosity and perhaps to you this product may not look like high tech but if you can imagine the time when this occur it be in the mid 40 this be really in he view a pretty piece of high tech well one of the thing that be really critical to try to distill from that experience be that in addition to that person ask I and say well how do you parent treat you when you be a child and I always say that they be really tough on I and not tough in the sense that most person think of where you parent yell at you or hit you or whatever they be tough in the sense that as I grow up both my mother and father would always say to I it be really important that you always remember two thing first of all when you go to bed at night you have get to look back on the day and make sure that you feel the day be a day which you contribute something and that you do everything you could to do it the good way you could and the second thing they say and we trust you that no matter where you be or where you go you will always do the right thing now I do not know how many of you have ever do that with you kid but if you do please trust I it be the most pressure you can put on a child to say laughter we trust you that you will always do the right thing when I be out with my friend drink beer I always be very aware of that word laughter and very careful one of the thing that have happen with technology be that it can only be helpful if it be useful of course but it can only be helpful too if it be accessible and it can only be helpful if it be affordable and in today world be useful affordable and accessible be not necessarily what happen in a lot of the technology that be do today so one of we passion in we company and now one of my personal passion be to be able to really work hard at make the technology useful accessible and affordable and to I that be very very critical now technology have change a lot since the Victrola day you know we now have of course incredibly powerful computer a tremendous thing that person refer to as a killer app be call the internet although frankly speak we do not believe the internet be the killer app what we believe be that the internet frankly be a connection of person and idea the internet happen to be just the medium in which that person and idea get connect and the power of connect person and idea can be pretty awesome and so we believe that through all the change that have occur that we be face today with a tremendous opportunity if we can connect person and idea more intensely and although you have see a plethora and a myriad of product that have come to the market today the key to I be how many of this product be able to provide person connectivity in a useful way accessibility in a easy manner and also affordability that regardless of the economic status that a person could have that they could have the opportunity to afford this technology so when you look at that we say well we would like to then enable that a little bit we would like to create a initiative and a couple of year ago at AMD we come up with this idea of say what if we create this initiative we call 50x15 where we be go to aim that by the year 2015 half of the world will be connect to the internet so that person and idea can get connect we know we could not do it by ourselves and by no means do we ever intend to imply that we at AMD could do it alone we always feel that this be something that could be do through partnership with government industry educational institution a myriad of other company and frankly even competitor so it be really a rather lofty initiative if you want to think that way but we feel that we have to put a real stake up in the year ahead that be bold enough and courageous enough that it would force we all to think of way to do thing differently and I will come back to that in a minute because I think the result so far have be remarkable and I can only anticipate and get real excited about what I think be go to happen in the next eight year while we get to the 2015 initiative where be we today that be year by year this come from we friend at Gapminder com that of you who have never look at they website you should look at it it be really impressive and you can see how the internet penetration have change over the year and so when we give ourselves this scorecard to say well where be we relate to we goal towards 2015 the thing that become apparent be three piece one be the western world define mostly by Western Europe and the United States have make a awful lot of progress the connectivity in this part of the world be really truly phenomenal and continue to increase as a matter of fact we think reach 100 percent be very doable even before the 2015 timeframe in other part of emerge country such as India and China the progress have be good have be solid have be good but in place that be not as developed place like Africa Latin America and other place in the world the progress have be rather slow as a matter of fact I be just recently visit South Africa I have the opportunity to have a discussion with President Mbeki and one of the thing that we talk about be what be it that be keep this connectivity goal from move ahead fast and one of the reason be in South Africa it cost 100 dollar a month to have a broadband connectivity it be impossible even in the United States for that cost to be able to enable the connectivity that we be all try to reach so we talk about way in which perhaps one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down so when you look at this chart you look at the very last it be a logarithmic chart on a horizontal scale you look at the very end we have get quite a long way to go to get to the 2015 goal of 50 percent but we be excite in we company we be motivate we really think it be a phenomenal driver of thing to force we to do thing differently and we look forward to be able to actually work with so many partner around the world to be able to reach that goal now one of the thing I would like to explain about 50x15 which I think be really critical be that it be not a charity it be actually a business venture let take a small segment of this of this unconnected world and call it the education market when you look at elementary school child we have hundred and hundred of million of child around the world that could benefit tremendously from be able to be connect to the internet therefore when we see that we see a opportunity to have a business that address the need of that segment and when we embark in this initiative from the very beginning we say it very clearly this be not a charity this be really a business venture one that address a very challenging segment of the market because what we have learn in the last three year be that this segment of the market whether it be education or under developed nation either way it be a segment that demand incredibly high quality incredibly high reliability tremendous low cost and access and a lot of challenge that frankly without actually do it it would be very difficult to understand and I will explain that in just a minute it be a initiative that be focus on simple accessible and human centric solution what we mean by that be you know frankly the pc be invent in 1980 roughly speak more or less and for 20 odd year it have not change it be still in most place a gray or black box and it look the same and frankly and I know that sometimes I offend some of my customer when I say this but I truly mean it if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it it would be very difficult to judge who make it because they be all highly commoditized but they be all different so there have not be a human centric approach to address this segment of the market so we really believe it be critical to think of it it remind I a lot of the talk we hear this morning about this operating room machinery that be design specifically for Africa we be talk about something very similar here and it have to be base on a geo sensitive approach what I mean by that be that in some part of the world the government play a key role in the development of technology in other part it do not in other part of the world you have a infrastructure that allow for manufacture to take place in other part it do not and then we have to be sensitive about how this technology can be develop and put into action in that region and the last piece which be really important and this be a opinion that we have not share by many this be one where we seem to stand alone on this one be that we really believe that the great success of this initiative can come by foster local integrate end to end ecosystem what I mean by that and let I use this example the country of South Africa because I be just there therefore I be a little bit familiar with some of the challenge they have it be a country of 45 million person it be a economy that be emerge it be begin to grow tremendously they have a objective to lower the cost of connectivity they have a computer company that make computer in South Africa they be develop a software training environment in they university what a place what a ideal place to create a ecosystem that could build the hardware and the software need for they school and to my surprise I learn in South Africa they have 18 dialect I always think they only have two English and Afrikaans but it turn out they have 18 dialect and to be able to meet the need of this rather complex educational system it could only be do from inside I do not think this segment of the market can be address by company parachute from another place of the world and just dump product and selling into the market so we believe that in that region of the world where the population be large and there be a infrastructure that can provide it that a local integrated end to end system be really critical for its success this be a picture of a classroom that we outfit with computer in Mexico in my home country this particular classroom happen to be in the state of Michoacan that of you that might be familiar with Mexico Michoacan be a very colorful state child dress with very colorful colorful clothes and it be incredible to see the power that this have in the hand of kid in a computer and I have to tell you that it be so easy to appreciate the impact that access to technology and connectivity can have in the life and education of this kid we just recently open a learning laboratory in a school in the West Cape in South Africa in a school that be call Nelson Mandela School and when you see the face and activity of this child be able to access computer it be just phenomenal and recently they have write we letter tell we how excited they be about the impact that this have have on they life on they educational dream on they capability and it be just phenomenal we have now deploy 30 different technologist in 18 different country and we have be able to connect million of person in a effort to continue to learn what this particular segment of the market need and demand and I have to tell you that although million do not sound like a lot in term of the billion that need to be connect it be a start and we be learn a lot and we be learn a tremendous amount about what we believe this segment need to be able to be effective one example of this have be the one laptop per child some of you be familiar with this this be a partnership between MIT and a group of company Google be involve Red Hat and AMD be a key player the electronics behind the one laptop per child be base on AMD technology it be a microprocessor but to give you a idea how creative this group of person can be one of the objective of the one laptop per child be to be able to achieve a 10 hour battery life because it be feel that a school day would last at least eight hour and you want the child to have the ability to use the laptop for at least one full day without have to recharge it the engineer have do a phenomenal amount of innovation on this part and battery life on this product be now 15 hour just through a lot of innovative work person have do because they be passionate and motivated to be able to do this we expect this to be deploy towards the end of this year and we be very excited at the opportunity that this be go to offer in the field of education it be a highly focused product aim at strictly the education market not only in the develop country but actually in the develop region as well because there be part of the United States where this can have also a huge impact on the ability to make education more fun and more efficient we also have partner with TED in this project with Architecture for Humanity and along with the TED Prize winner Cameron Sinclair we be have a contest that we have issue to the architectural community to come up with the good design for a computer lab for a emerge region and we be really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this and can not wait to see what come out of this exciting exciting activity let I come back to the beginning to end this presentation I will tell you that one of the thing that I feel be really critical for we in industry in business be to be able to be passionate about solve this problem I do not think it be enough to be able to put they on a spreadsheet and look at number and say yes that be a good business I really believe that you have to have a passion for it and one of the thing that I learn too from my parent and I will give you a little anecdote especially from my father and it take I a while to understand it but he say to I when I go to college he say you be the first person in the family to go to college and it be really important you understand that for civilization to make progress each generation have to do good than the last one and therefore this be you opportunity to do good than my generation frankly I do not know that I really understand what he tell I at the time I be eager to go off to college and go find girl and study and girl and study but then I finish college and I fall in love I graduate I decide to get married and on my wedding day my father come to I again and say you know I be go to remind you again that each generation have to do good than the last one you have to be a good husband than I be because that be how you make progress and now he begin to make sense because I know what a great husband he be and now he be once again begin to put pressure on I like he do when I be a little kid and then a few year later I have a child my first child and again my father come to the hospital and we be look at the glass and see all the child on the other side and he say I have get to remind you again that for each generation to do good you be go to have to be a good father than I be that be when it dawn on I the tremendous challenge that he be place on I because he be a great father but the key be that he instil in I a passion to really get up every day in the morning and want to do good to really get up and think that my role in life be not just to be the ceo of a Fortune 500 company it be get to be that someday I can look back and this place be truly good through some small contribution that perhaps each of we could make thank you very much applause
