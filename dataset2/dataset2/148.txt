so where be the robot we have be tell for 40 year already that they be come soon very soon they will be do everything for we they will be cook cleaning buy thing shop building but they be not here meanwhile we have illegal immigrant do all the work but we do not have any robot so what can we do about that what can we say so I want to give a little bit of a different perspective of how we can perhaps look at this thing in a little bit of a different way and this be a x ray picture of a real beetle and a Swiss watch back from 88 you look at that what be true then be certainly true today we can still make the piece we can make the right piece we can make the circuitry of the right computational power but we can not actually put they together to make something that will actually work and be as adaptive as this system so let try to look at it from a different perspective let summon the good designer the mother of all designer let see what evolution can do for we so we throw in we create a primordial soup with lot of piece of robot with bar with motor with neuron put they all together and put all this under kind of natural selection under mutation and reward thing for how well they can move forward a very simple task and it be interesting to see what kind of thing come out of that so if you look you can see a lot of different machine come out of this they all move around they all crawl in different way and you can see on the right that we actually make a couple of this thing and they work in reality this be not very fantastic robot but they evolve to do exactly what we reward they for for move forward so that be all do in simulation but we can also do that on a real machine here be a physical robot that we actually have a population of brain compete or evolve on the machine it be like a rodeo show they all get a ride on the machine and they get reward for how fast or how far they can make the machine move forward and you can see this robot be not ready to take over the world yet but they gradually learn how to move forward and they do this autonomously so in this two example we have basically machine that learn how to walk in simulation and also machine that learn how to walk in reality but I want to show you a different approach and this be this robot over here which have four leg it have eight motor four on the knee and four on the hip it have also two tilt sensor that tell the machine which way it be tilt but this machine do not know what it look like you look at it and you see it have four leg the machine do not know if it be a snake if it be a tree it do not have any idea what it look like but it be go to try to find that out initially it do some random motion and then it try to figure out what it might look like and you be see a lot of thing pass through its mind a lot of self model that try to explain the relationship between actuation and sense it then try to do a second action that create the most disagreement among prediction of this alternative model like a scientist in a lab then it do that and try to explain that and prune out its self model this be the last cycle and you can see it be pretty much figure out what its self look like and once it have a self model it can use that to derive a pattern of locomotion so what you be see here be a couple of machine a pattern of locomotion we be hope that it wass go to have a kind of evil spidery walk but instead it create this pretty lame way of move forward but when you look at that you have to remember that this machine do not do any physical trial on how to move forward nor do it have a model of itself it kind of figure out what it look like and how to move forward and then actually try that out applause so we will move forward to a different idea so that be what happen when we have a couple of that be what happen when you have a couple of ok ok ok laughter they do not like each other so there be a different robot that be what happen when the robot actually be reward for do something what happen if you do not reward they for anything you just throw they in so we have this cube like the diagram show here the cube can swivel or flip on its side and we just throw 1 000 of this cube into a soup this be in simulation and do not reward they for anything we just let they flip we pump energy into this and see what happen in a couple of mutation so initially nothing happen they be just flip around there but after a very short while you can see this blue thing on the right there begin to take over they begin to self replicate so in absence of any reward the intrinsic reward be self replication and we have actually build a couple of this and this be part of a large robot make out of this cube it be a accelerated view where you can see the robot actually carry out some of its replication process so you be feed it with more material cube in this case and more energy and it can make another robot so of course this be a very crude machine but we be work on a micro scale version of this and hopefully the cube will be like a powder that you pour in ok so what can we learn this robot be of course not very useful in themselves but they might teach we something about how we can build good robot and perhaps how human animal create self model and learn and one of the thing that I think be important be that we have to get away from this idea of design the machine manually but actually let they evolve and learn like child and perhaps that be the way we will get there thank you applause
