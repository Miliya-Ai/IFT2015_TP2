I really be honor to be here and as Chris say it be be over 20 year since I start work in Africa my first introduction be at the Abidjan airport on a sweaty Ivory Coast morning I have just leave Wall Street cut my hair to look like Margaret Mead give away most everything that I own and arrive with all the essential some poetry a few clothes and of course a guitar because I be go to save the world and I think I would just start with the African continent but literally within day of arrive I be tell in no uncertain term by a number of west African woman that African do not want save thank you very much least of all not by I I be too young unmarried I have no child do not really know Africa and besides my French be pitiful and so it be a incredibly painful time in my life and yet it really start to give I the humility to start listen I think that failure can be a incredibly motivate force as well so I move to Kenya and work in Uganda and I meet a group of Rwandan woman who ask I in 1986 to move to Kigali to help they start the first microfinance institution there and I do and we end up name it Duterimbere mean to go forward with enthusiasm and while we be do it I realize that there be not a lot of business that be viable and start by woman and so maybe I should try to run a business too and so I start look around and I hear about a bakery that be run by 20 prostitute and be a little intrigued I go to go meet this group and what I find be 20 unwed mother who be try to survive and it be really the beginning of my understanding the power of language and how what we call person so often distance we from they and make they little I also find out that the bakery be nothing like a business that in fact it be a classic charity run by a well intention person who essentially spend 600 dollar a month to keep this 20 woman busy make little craft and bake goods and live on 50 cent a day still in poverty so I make a deal with the woman I say look we get rid of the charity side and we run this as a business and I will help you they nervously agree I nervously start and of course thing be always hard than you think they be go to be first of all I think well we need a sale team and we clearly be not the a Team here so let I do all this training and the epitome be when I literally march into the street of Nyamirambo which be the popular quarter of Kigali with a bucket and I sell all this little doughnut to person and I come back and I be like you see and the woman say you know Jacqueline who in Nyamirambo be not go to buy doughnut out of a orange bucket from a tall American woman and like laughter it be a good point so then I go the whole American way with competition team and individual completely fail but over time the woman learn to sell on they own way and they start listen to the marketplace and they come back with idea for cassava chip and banana chip and sorghum bread and before you know it we have corner the Kigali market and the woman be earn three to four time the national average and with that confidence surge I think well it be time to create a real bakery so let paint it and the woman say that be a really great idea and I say well what color do you want to paint it and they say well you choose and I say no no I be learn to listen you choose it be you bakery you street you country not mine but they would not give I a answer so one week two week three week go by and finally I say well how about blue and they say Blue blue we love blue let do it blue so I go to the store I bring Gaudence the recalcitrant one of all and we bring all this paint and fabric to make curtain and on paint day we all gather in Nyamirambo and the idea be we would paint it white with blue as trim like a little French bakery but that be clearly not as satisfy as paint a wall of blue like a morning sky so blue blue everything become blue the wall be blue the window be blue the sidewalk out front be paint blue and Aretha Franklin be shout r e s p e c t the woman hip be sway and little kid be try to grab the paintbrush but it be they day and at the end of it we stand across the street and we look at what we have do and I say it be so beautiful and the woman say it really be and I say and I think the color be perfect and they all nod they head except for Gaudence and I say what and she say nothing and I say what and she say well it be pretty but you know we color really it be green and laughter I learn then that listen be not just about patience but that when you have live on charity and dependent you whole life long it be really hard to say what you mean and mostly because person never really ask you and when they do you do not really think they want to know the truth and so then I learn that listen be not only about wait but it be also learn how good to ask question and so I live in Kigali for about two and a half year do this two thing and it be a extraordinary time in my life and it teach I three lesson that I think be so important for we today and certainly in the work that I do the first be that dignity be more important to the human spirit than wealth as Eleni have say when person gain income they gain choice and that be fundamental to dignity but as human being we also want to see each other and we want to be hear by each other and we should never forget that the second be that traditional charity and aid be never go to solve the problem of poverty I think Andrew pretty well covered that so I will move to the third point which be that market alone also be not go to solve the problem of poverty yes we run this as a business but someone need to pay the philanthropic support that come into the training and the management support the strategic advice and maybe most important of all the access to new contact network and new market and so on a micro level there be a real role for this combination of investment and philanthropy and on a macro level some of the speaker have infer that even health should be privatize but have have a father with heart disease and realize that what we family could afford be not what he should have get and have a good friend step in to help I really believe that all person deserve access to health at price they can afford I think the market can help we figure that out but there be get to be a charitable component or I do not think we be go to create the kind of society we want to live in and so it be really that lesson that make I decide to build Acumen Fund about six year ago it be a nonprofit venture capital fund for the poor a few oxymoron in one sentence it essentially raise charitable fund from individual foundation and corporation and then we turn around and we invest equity and loan in both for profit and nonprofit entity that deliver affordable health housing energy clean water to low income person in South Asia and Africa so that they can make they own choice we have invest about 20 million dollar in 20 different enterprise and have in so do create nearly 20 000 job and deliver ten of million of service to person who otherwise would not be able to afford they I want to tell you two story both of they be in Africa both of they be about invest in entrepreneur who be commit to service and who really know the market both of they live at the confluence of public health and enterprise and both of they because they be manufacturer create job directly and create income indirectly because they be in the malaria sector and Africa lose about 13 billion dollar a year because of malaria and so as person get healthy they also get wealthy the first one be call Advanced Bio extract limit it be a company build in Kenya about seven year ago by a incredible entrepreneur name Patrick Henfrey and he three colleague this be old hand farmer who have go through all the agricultural up and downs in Kenya over the last 30 year now this plant be a Artemisia plant it be the basic component for artemisinin which be the good known treatment for malaria it be indigenous to China and the Far East but give that the prevalence of malaria be here in Africa Patrick and he colleague say let bring it here because it be a high value add product the farmer get three to four time the yield that they would with maize and so use patient capital money that they could raise early on that actually get below market return and be willing to go the long haul and be combine with management assistance strategic assistance they have now create a company where they purchase from 7 500 farmer so that be about 50 000 person affect and I think some of you may have visit this farmer be help by KickStart and TechnoServe who help they become more self sufficient they buy it they dry it and they bring it to this factory which be purchase in part by again patient capital from Novartis who have a real interest in get the powder so that they can make Coartem Acumen be work with abe for the past year year and a half both on look at a new business plan and what do expansion look like help with management support and help to do term sheet and raise capital and I really understand what patient capital mean emotionally in the last month or so because the company be literally 10 day away from prove that the product they produce be at the world quality level need to make Coartem when they be in the big cash crisis of they history and we call all of the social investor we know now some of this same social investor be really interested in Africa and understand the importance of agriculture and they even help the farmer and even when we explain that if ABE go away all that 7 500 job go away too we sometimes have this bifurcation between business and the social and it be really time we start think more creatively about how they can be fuse so Acumen make not one but two bridge loan and the good news be they do indeed meet world quality classification and be now in the final stage of close a 20 million dollar round to move it to the next level and I think that this will be one of the more important company in East Africa this be Samuel he be a farmer he be actually live in the Kibera slum when he father call he and tell he about Artemisia and the value add potential so he move back to the farm and long story short they now have seven acre under cultivation Samuel kid be in private school and he be start to help other farmer in the area also go into artemisia production dignity be more important than wealth the next one many of you know I talk about it a little at Oxford two year ago and some of you visit a to z manufacturing which be one of the great real company in East Africa it be another one that live at the confluence of health and enterprise and this be really a story about a public private solution that have really work it start in Japan Sumitomo have develop a technology essentially to impregnate a polyethylene base fiber with organic insecticide so you could create a bed net a malaria bed net that would last five year and not need to be re dip it could alter the vector but like Artemisia it have be produce only in East Asia and as part of its social responsibility Sumitomo say why do not we experiment with whether we can produce it in Africa for African UNICEF come forward and say we will buy most of the net and then we will give they away as part of the global fund and the U N commitment to pregnant woman and child for free Acumen come in with the patient capital and we also help to identify the entrepreneur that we would all partner with here in Africa and Exxon provide the initial resin well in look around for entrepreneur there be none good that we could find on earth than Anuj Shah in a to z manufacture company it be a 40 year old company it understand manufacture it be go from socialist Tanzania into capitalist Tanzania and continue to flourish it have about 1 000 employee when we first find it and so Anuj take the entrepreneurial risk here in Africa to produce a public good that be purchase by the aid establishment to work with malaria and long story short again they have be so successful in we first year the first net go off the line in October of 2003 we think the hit it out of the box number be 150 000 net a year this year they be now produce eight million net a year and they employ 5 000 person 90 percent of whom be woman mostly unskilled they be in a joint venture with Sumitomo and so from a enterprise perspective for Africa and from a public health perspective this be real success but it be only half the story if we be really look at solve problem of poverty because it be not long term sustainable it be a company with one big customer and if avian flu hit or for any other reason the world decide that malaria be no long as much of a priority everybody lose and so Anuj and Acumen have be talk about test the private sector because the assumption that the aid establishment have make be that look in a country like Tanzania 80 percent of the population make less than two dollar a day it cost at manufacturing point six dollar to produce this and it cost the establishment another six dollar to distribute it so the market price in a free market would be about 12 dollar per net most person can not afford that so let give it away free and we say well there be another option let use the market as the good listening device we have and understand at what price person would pay for this so they get the dignity of choice we can start build local distribution and actually it can cost the public sector much less and so we come in with a second round of patient capital to a to z a loan as well as a grant so that a to z could play with pricing and listen to the marketplace and find a number of thing one that person will pay different price but the overwhelming number of person will come forth at one dollar per net and make a decision to buy it and when you listen to they they will also have a lot to say about what they like and what they do not like and that some of the channel we think would work do not work but because of this experimentation and iteration that be allow because of the patient capital we have now find that it cost about a dollar in the private sector to distribute and a dollar to buy the net so then from a policy perspective when you start with the market we have a choice we can continue go along at 12 dollar a net and the customer pay zero or we could at least experiment with some of it to charge one dollar a net cost the public sector another six dollar a net give the person the dignity of choice and have a distribution system that might over time start sustain itself we have get to start have conversation like this and I do not think there be any good way to start than use the market but also to bring other person to the table around it whenever I go to visit a to z I think of my grandmother Stella she be very much like that woman sit behind the sewing machine she grow up on a farm in Austria very poor do not have very much education she move to the United States where she meet my grandfather who be a cement hauler and they have nine child three of they die as baby my grandmother have tuberculosis and she work in a sewing machine shop make shirt for about 10 cent a hour she like so many of the woman I see at a to z work hard every day understand what suffering be have a deep faith in God love she child and would never have accept a handout but because she have the opportunity of the marketplace and she live in a society that provide the safety of have access to affordable health and education she child and they child be able to live life of real purpose and follow real dream I look around at my sibling and my cousin and as I say there be a lot of we and I see teacher and musician hedge fund manager designer one sister who make other person wish come true and my wish when I see that woman I meet that farmer and I think about all the person across this continent who be work hard every day be that they have that sense of opportunity and possibility and that they also can believe and get access to service so that they child too can live that life of great purpose it should not be that difficult but what it take be a commitment from all of we to essentially refuse trite assumption get out of we ideological box it take invest in that entrepreneur that be commit to service as well as to success it take open you arm both wide and expect very little love in return but demand accountability and bring the accountability to the table as well and most of all most of all it require that all of we have the courage and the patience whether we be rich or poor African or non African local or diaspora leave or right to really start listen to each other thank you applause
