on simplicity what a great way to start First of all I have be watch this trend where we have this book like such and such for dummy do you know this book this such and such for dummy my daughter point out that I be very similar look so this be a bit of a problem laughter but I be look online at Amazon com for other book like this you know there be also something call the complete idiot guide there be a sort of business model around be stupid in some sense we like to have technology make we feel bad for some strange reason but I really like that so I write a book call the law of simplicity I be in Milan last week for the Italian launch it be kind of a book about question question about simplicity very few answer I be also wonder myself what be simplicity be it good be it bad be complexity good I be not sure after I write the law of simplicity I be very tired of simplicity as you can imagine and so in my life I have discover that vacation be the most important skill for any kind of over achiever because you company will always take away you life but they can never take away you vacation in theory laughter so I go to the Cape last summer to hide from simplicity and I go to the gap because I only have black pants so I go and buy khaki shorts or whatever and unfortunately they brand be all about keep it simple laughter I open up a magazine and Visa branding be Business take simplicity I develop photograph and Kodak say keep it simple so I feel kind of weird that simplicity be sort of follow I around so I turn on the tv and I do not watch tv very much but you know this person this be Paris Hilton apparently and she have this show the simple life so I watch this it be not very simple a little bit confusing laughter so I look for a different show to watch so I open up this tv guide thing and on the e channel this simple life show be very popular they will play it over and over and over laughter so it be traumatize actually so I want to escape again so I go out to my car and Cape Cod there be idyllic road and all of we can drive in this room and when you drive this sign be very important it be a very simple sign it say road and road approach so I be mostly drive along okay and then I see this sign laughter so I think complexity be attack I suddenly so I think ah simplicity very important but then I think oh simplicity what would that be like on a beach what if the sky be 41 percent gray would not that be the perfect sky I mean that simplicity sky but in reality the sky look like this it be a beautiful complex sky you know with the pink and blues we can not help but love complexity we be human being we love complex thing we love relationship very complex so we love this kind of stuff I be at this place call the Media Lab maybe some of you guy have hear of this place it be design by I M Pei one of the premier modernist architect modernism mean white box and it be a perfect white box laughter and some of you guy be entrepreneur etc whatever last month I be at Google and boy that cafeteria man you guy have thing here in Silicon Valley like stock option see in academia we get title lot of title last year at TED this be all my title I have a lot of title I have a default title as a father of a bunch of daughter this year at TED I be happy to report that I have new title in addition to my previous title another associate director of Research and this also happen so I have five daughter now laughter that be my baby Reina applause thank you and so my life be much more complex because of the baby actually but that be okay we will still stay married I think but look way back when I be a child you see I grow up in a tofu factory in Seattle many of you may not like tofu because you have not have good tofu but tofu be a good food it be a very simple kind of food it be very hard work to make tofu as a child we use to wake up at 1 a m and work till 6 p m six day a week my father be kind of like Andy Grove paranoid of the competition so often seven day a week family business equal child labor we be a great model so I love go to school school be great and maybe go to school help I get to this media lab place I be not sure laughter thank you but the media lab be a interesting place and it be important to I because as a student I be a computer science undergrad and I discover design later on in my life and there be this person Muriel Cooper who know Muriel Cooper Muriel Cooper be not she amazing Muriel Cooper she be wacky and she be a tedster exactly and she show we she show the world how to make the computer beautiful again and she be very important in my life because she be the one that tell I to leave MIT and go to art school it be the good advice I ever get so I go to art school because of she she pass away in 1994 and I be hire back to MIT to try to fill she shoe but it be so hard this amazing person Muriel Cooper when I be in Japan I go to a art school in Japan I have a nice sort of situation because somehow I be connect to Paul Rand some of you guy know Paul Rand the great graphic designer I be sorry out there the great graphic designer Paul Rand design the IBM logo the Westinghouse logo he basically say I have design everything and also Ikko Tanaka be a very important mentor in my life the Paul Rand of Japan he design most of the major icon of Japan like Issey Miyake brand and also Muji when you have mentor and yesterday Kareem Abdul Jabbar talk about mentor this person in you life the problem with mentor be that they all die this be a sad thing but it be actually a happy thing in a way because you can remember they in they pure form I think that the mentor that we all meet sort of humanize we when you get old and you be all freak out whatever the mentor calm we down and I be grateful for my mentor and I be sure all of you be too because the human thing be very hard when you be at MIT the t do not stand for human it stand for technology and because of that I always wonder about this human thing so I have always be google this word human to find out how many hit I get and in 2001 I have 26 million hit and for computer because computer be against human a bit I have 42 million hit let I do a Al Gore here so if you sort of compare that like this you will see that computer versus human I have be track this for the last year computer versus human over the last year have change it use to be kind of two to one now human be catch up very good we human we be catch up with the computer in the simplicity realm it be also interesting so if you compare complexity to simplicity it be also catch up in a way too so somehow human and simplicity be intertwine I think I have a confession I be not a man of simplicity I spend my entire early career make complex stuff lot of complex stuff I write computer program to make complex graphic like this I have client in Japan to make really complex stuff like this and I have always feel bad about it in a sense so I hide in a time dimension I build thing in a time graphic dimension I do this series of calendar for Shiseido this be a floral theme calendar in 1997 and this be a firework calendar so you launch the number into space because the Japanese believe that when you see firework you be cool for some reason this be why they have firework in the summer a very extreme culture lastly this be a fall base calendar because I have so many leaf in my yard so this be the leaf in my yard essentially and so I make a lot of this type of thing I have be lucky to have be there before person make this kind of thing and so I make all this kind of stuff that mess with you eye I feel kind of bad about that tomorrow Paola Antonelli be speak I love Paola she have this show right now at MoMA where some of this early work be here on display at MoMA on the wall if you be in New York please go and see that but I have have a problem because I make all this fly stuff and person say oh I know you work you be the guy that make eye candy and when you be tell this you feel kind of weird Eye candy sort of pejorative do not you think so I say no I make eye meat instead laughter and eye meat be something different something more fibrous something more powerful perhaps but what could that be eye meat I have be interested in computer program all my life actually computer program be essentially tree and when you make art with a computer program there be kind of a problem whenever you make art with a computer program you be always on the tree and the paradox be that for excellent art you want to be off the tree so this be sort of a complication I have find so to get off the tree I begin to use my old computer I take this to Tokyo in 2001 to make computer object this be a new way to type on my old color classic you can not type very much on this I also discover that a ir mouse respond to CRT emission and start to move by itself so this be a self draw machine and also one year the g3 Bondi Blue thing that caddy would come out like dangerous like whack like that but I think this be very interesting what if I make like a car crash test so I have a crash test laughter and sort of measure the impact stuff like this be thing I make just to sort of understand what this thing be laughter shortly after this 9 11 happen and I be very depressed I be concern with contemporary art that be all about piss and sort of really sad thing and so I want to think about something happy so I focus on food as my area this sort of clementine peel thing in Japan it be a wonderful thing to remove the clementine peel just in one piece who be do that before one piece clementine oh you guy be miss out if you have not do it yet it be very good and I discover I can make sculpture out of this actually in different form if you dry they quick you can make like elephant and steer and stuff and my wife do not like this because they mold so I have to stop that so I go back to the computer and I buy five large fries and scan they all and I be look for some kind of food theme and I write some software to automatically lay out French fry image and as a child I have hear that song you know oh beautiful for spacious sky for amber wave of grain so I make this amber wave image it be sort of a Midwest cornfield out of French fries and also as a child I be the fat kid in class so I use to love Cheetos oh I love Cheetos yummy so I want to play with Cheetos in some way I be not sure where to go with this I invent Cheeto paint Cheeto paint be a very simple way to paint with Cheetos laughter I discover that Cheetos be good expressive material and with this Cheetos I begin to think what can I make with this Cheetos and so I begin to crinkle up potato chip fleck and also pretzel I be look for some kind of form and in the end I make 100 butter fries do you get it laughter and each butter fry be compose of different piece person ask I how they make the antenna sometimes they find a hair in the food that be my hair my hair clean it be okay I be a tenured professor which mean basically I do not have to work anymore it be a strange business model I can come into work everyday and staple five piece of paper and just stare at it with my latte end of story laughter but I realize that life could be very boring so I have be think about life and I notice that my camera my digital camera versus my car a very strange thing the car be so big the camera be so small yet the manual for the camera be so much big than the car manual it do not make any sense laughter so I be in the Cape one time and I type the word simplicity and I discover in this weird m night Shyamalan way that I discover the letter m i t you know the word in the word simplicity and complexity m i t occur in perfect sequence it be a bit eerie be not it so I think maybe I will do this for the next twenty year or something and I write this book the law of simplicity it be a very short simple book there be ten law and three key the ten law and three key I will not go over they because that be why I have a book and also that be why it be on the web for free but the law be kind of like sushi in a way there be all kind in Japan they say that sushi be challenge you know the uni be the most challenging so number ten be challenge person hate number ten like they hate uni actually the three key be easy to eat so this be anago cook already so easy to eat so enjoy you sushi meal later with the law of simplicity because I want to simplify they for you because that be what this be about I have to simplify this thing so if I simplify the law of simplicity I have what be call the cookie versus laundry thing anyone who have kid know that if you offer a kid a big cookie or a small cookie which cookie be they go to take the big cookie you can say the small cookie have Godiva chocolate bit in it but it do not work they want the big cookie but if you offer kid two pile of laundry to fold the small pile or the big pile which will they choose strangely not the big pile so I think it be as simple as this you know when you want more it be because you want to enjoy it when you want less it be because it be about work and so to boil it all down simplicity be about live life with more enjoyment and less pain I think this be sort of simple more versus less basically it always depend this book I write because I want to figure out life I love life I love be alive I like to see thing and so life be a big question I think in simplicity because you be try to simplify you life and I just love to see the world the world be a amazing place by be at TED we see so many thing at one time and I can not help but enjoy look at everything in the world like everything you see every time you wake up it be such a joy to sort of experience everything in the world from everything from a weird hotel lobby to Saran wrap place over you window to this moment where I have my road in front of my house pave dark black and this white moth be sit there die in the sun and so this whole thing have strike I as exciting to be here because life be finite this be give to I by the chairman of Shiseido he be a expert in age this horizontal axis be how old you be twelve year old twenty four year old seventy four ninety six year old and this be some medical datum so brain strength increase up to 60 and then after 60 it sort of go down kind of depress in a way also if you look at you physical strength you know I have a lot of cocky freshman at MIT so I tell they oh you body be really get strong and strong but in you late twenty and mid thirty cell they die ok it get they to work hard sometimes and if you have you vision vision be interesting as you age from infant age you vision get good and maybe in you late teens early twenty you be look for a mate and you vision go after that laughter you social responsibility be very interesting so as you get old you may like have kid whatever and then the kid graduate and you have no responsibility any more that be very good too but if any of you person ask what actually go up do anything go up what be the positive part of this you know I think wisdom always go up I love this eighty year old ninety year old guy and woman they have so many thought and they have so much wisdom and I think you know this TED thing I have come here and this be the fourth time and I come here for this wisdom I think this whole TED effect it sort of up you wisdom somehow and I be so glad to be here and I be very grateful to be here Chris and this be a amazing experience for I as well
