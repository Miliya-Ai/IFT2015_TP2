I be walk in the market one day with my wife and somebody stick a cage in my face and in between that slit be the sad eye I have ever see there be a very sick orangutan baby my first encounter that evening I come back to the market in the dark and I hear uhh uhh and sure enough I find a die orangutan baby on a garbage heap of course the cage be salvage I take up the little baby massage she force she to drink until she finally start breathe normally this be Uce she be now live in the jungle of Sungai Wain and this be Matahari she second son which by the way be also the son of the second orangutan I rescue Dodoy that change my life quite dramatically and as of today I have almost 1 000 baby in my two center applause no no no wrong it be horrible it be a proof of we fail to save they in the wild it be not good this be merely proof of everyone fail to do the right thing have more than all the orangutan in all the zoo in the world together just now like victim for every baby six have disappear from the forest the deforestation especially for oil palm to provide biofuel for western country be what be cause this problem and that be the peat swamp forest on 20 meter of peat the large accumulation of organic material in the world when you open this for grow oil palm you be create co2 volcano that be emit so much co2 that my country be now the third large emitter of greenhouse gas in the world after China and the United States and we do not have any industry at all it be only because of this deforestation and this be horrible image I be not go to talk too long about it but there be so many of the family of Uce which be not so fortunate to live out there in the forest that still have to go through that process and I do not know anymore where to put they so I decide that I have to come up with a solution for she but also a solution that will benefit the person that be try to exploit that forest to get they hand on the last timber and that be cause in that way the loss of habitat and all that victim so I create the place Samboja Lestari and the idea be if I can do this on the bad possible place that I can think of where there be really nothing leave no one will have a excuse to say yeah but no everyone should be able to follow this so we be in East Borneo this be the place where I start as you can see there be only yellow terrain there be nothing left just a bit of grass there in 2002 we have about 50 percent of the person jobless there there be a huge amount of crime person spend so much of they money on health issue and drink water there be no agricultural productivity leave this be the poor district in the whole province and it be a total extinction of wildlife this be like a biological desert when I stand there in the grass it be hot not even the sound of insect just this wave grass still four year later we have create job for about 3 000 person the climate have change I will show you no more flooding no more fire it be no long the poor district and there be a huge development of biodiversity we have get over 1 000 species we have 137 bird species as of today we have 30 species of reptile so what happen here we create a huge economic failure in this forest so basically the whole process of destruction have go a bit slow than what be happen now with the oil palm but we see the same thing we have slash and burn agriculture person can not afford the fertilizer so they burn the tree and have the mineral available there the fire become more frequent and after a while you be stuck with a area of land where there be no fertility leave there be no tree leave still in this place in this grassland where you can see we very first office there on that hill four year later there be this one green blop on the Earth surface applause and there be all this animal and all this person happy and there be this economic value so how be this possible it be quite simple if you will look at the step we buy the land we deal with the fire and then only we start do the reforestation by combine agriculture with forestry only then we set up the infrastructure and management and the monetary but we make sure that in every step of the way the local person be go to be fully involve so that no outside force would be able to interfere with that the person would become the defender of that forest so we do the person profit planet principle but we do it in addition to a sure legal status because if the forest belong to the state person say it belong to I it belong to everyone and then we apply all this other principle like transparency professional management measurable result scalability unclear etc what we do be we formulate recipe how to go from a start situation where you have nothing to a target situation you formulate a recipe base upon the factor you can control whether it be the skill or the fertilizer or the plant choice and then you look at the output and you start measure what come out now in this recipe you also have the cost you also know how much labor be need if you can drop this recipe on the map on a sandy soil on a clay soil on a steep slope on flat soil you put that different recipe if you combine they out of that come a business plan come a work plan and you can optimize it for the amount of labor you have available or for the amount of fertilizer you have and you can do it this be how it look like in practice we have this grass we want to get rid of it exude unclear like compound from the root the acacia tree be of a very low value but we need they to restore the micro climate to protect the soil and to shake out the grass and after eight year they might actually yield some timber that be if you can preserve it in the right way which we can do with bamboo peel it be a old temple building technique from Japan but bamboo be very fire susceptible so if we would plant that in the beginning we would have a very high risk of lose everything again so we plant it later along the waterway to filter the water provide the raw product just in time for when the timber become available so the idea be how to integrate this flow in space over time and with the limited means you have so we plant the tree we plant this pineapple and bean and ginger in between to reduce the competition for the tree the crop fertilizer Organic material be useful for the agricultural crop for the person but also help the tree the farmer have free land the system yield early income the orangutan get healthy food and we can speed up ecosystem regeneration while even save some money so beautiful what a theory but be it really that easy not really because if you look at what happen in 1998 the fire start this be a area of about 50 million hectare January February March April May we lose 5 5 million hectare in just a matter of a few month this be because we have 10 000 of that underground fire that you also have in Pennsylvania here in the United States and once the soil get dry you be in a dry season you get crack oxygen go in flame come out and the problem start all over again so how to break that cycle fire be the big problem this be what it look like for three month for three month the automatic light outside do not go off because it be that dark we lose all the crop no child gain weight for over a year they lose 12 iq point it be a disaster for orangutan and person so this fire be really the first thing to work on that be why I put it as a single point up there and you need the local person for that because this grassland once they start burn it go through it like a windstorm and you lose again the last bit of ash and nutrient to the first rainfall go to the sea kill off the coral reef there so you have to do it with the local person that be the short term solution but you also need a long term solution so what we do be we create a ring of sugar palm around the area this sugar palm turn out to be fire resistant also flood resistant by the way and they provide a lot of income for local person this be what it look like the person have to tap they twice a day just a millimeter slice and the only thing you harvest be sugar water carbon dioxide rain fall and a little bit of sunshine in principle you make that tree into biological photovoltaic cell and you can create so much energy from this they produce three time more energy per hectare per year because you can tap they on a daily basis you do not need to harvest unclear or any other of the crop so this be the combination where we have all this genetic potential in the tropics which be still unexploited and do it in combination with technology but also you legal side need to be in very good order so we buy that land and here be where we start we project in the middle of nowhere and if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area be divide into strip that go over different type of soil and we be actually monitor measure every single tree in this 2 000 hectare 5 000 acre and this forest be quite different what I really do be I just follow nature and nature do not know monoculture but a natural forest be multilayered that mean that both in the ground and above the ground it can make good use of the available light it can store more carbon in the system it can provide more function but it be more complicated it be not that simple and you have to work with the person so just like nature we also grow fast planting tree and underneath that we grow the slow grow primary grain forest tree of a very high diversity that can optimally use that light then what be just as important get the right fungus in there that will grow into that leaf bring back the nutrient to the root of the tree that have just drop that leaf within 24 hour and they become like nutrient pump you need the bacterium to fix nitrogen and without that microorganism you will not have any performance at all and then we start plant only 1 000 tree a day we could have plant many many more but we do not want to because we want to keep the number of job stable we do not want to lose the person that be go to work in that plantation and we do a lot of work here we use indicator plant to look at what soil type or what vegetable will grow or what tree will grow here and we have monitor every single one of that tree from space this be what it look like in reality you have this irregular ring around it with strip of 100 meter wide with sugar palm that can provide income for 648 family it be only a small part of the area the nursery in here be quite different if you look at the number of tree species we have in Europe for instance from the ural up to England you know how many 165 in this nursery we be go to grow 10 time more than the number of species can you imagine you do need to know what you be work with but it be that diversity which make it work that you can go from this zero situation by plant the vegetable and the tree or directly the tree in the line in that grass there put up the buffer zone produce you compost and then make sure that at every stage of that up grow forest there be crop that can be use in the begin maybe pineapple and bean and corn in the second phase there will be banana and papaya later on there will be chocolate and chily and then slowly the tree start take over bring in produce from the fruit from the timber from the fuel wood and finally the sugar palm forest take over and provide the person with permanent income on the top leave underneath that green stripe you see some white dot that be actually individual pineapple plant that you can see from space and in that area we start grow some acacia tree that you just see before so this be after one year and this be after two year and that be green if you look from the tower this be when we start attack the grass we plant in the seedling mix with the banana the papaya all the crop for the local person but the tree be grow up fast in between as well and three year later 137 species of bird be live here applause so we lower air temperature three to five degree celsius air humidity be up 10 percent cloud cover I be go to show it to you be up Rainfall be up and all this species and income this ecolodge that I build here three year before be a empty yellow field this transponder that we operate with the European Space Agency it give we the benefit that every satellite that come over to calibrate itself be take a picture that picture we use to analyze how much carbon how the forest be develop and we can monitor every tree use satellite image through we cooperation we can use this datum now to provide other region with recipe and the same technology we actually have it already with Google Earth if you would use a little bit of you technology to put tracking device in truck and use Google Earth in combination with that you could directly tell what palm oil have be sustainably produce which company be steal the timber and you could save so much more carbon than with any measure of save energy here so this be the Samboja Lestari area you measure how the tree grow back but you can also measure the biodiversity come back and biodiversity be a indicator of how much water can be balance how many medicine can be keep here and finally I make it into the rain machine because this forest be now create its own rain this nearby city of Balikpapan have a big problem with water it be 80 percent surround by seawater and we have now a lot of intrusion there now we look at the cloud above this forest we look at the reforestation area the semi open area and the open area and look at this image I will just run they very quickly through in the tropics raindrop be not form from ice crystal which be the case in the temperate zone you need the tree with unclear chemical that come out of the leaf of the tree that initiate the raindrop so you create a cool place where cloud can accumulate and you have the tree to initiate the rain and look there be now 11 2 percent more cloud already after three year if you look at rainfall it be already up 20 percent at that time let look at the next year and you can see that that trend be continue where at first we have a small cap of high rainfall that cap be now widen and get high and if we look at the rainfall pattern above Samboja Lestari it use to be the dry place but now you see consistently see a peak of rain form there so you can actually change the climate when there be trade wind of course the effect disappear but afterwards as soon as the wind stabilize you see again that the rainfall peak come back above this area so to say it be hopeless be not the right thing to do because we actually can make that difference if you integrate the various technology and it be nice to have the science but it still depend mostly upon the person on you education we have we farmer school but the real success of course be we band because if a baby be bear we will play so everyone we family and you do not make trouble with you family this be how it look we have this road go around the area which bring the person electricity and water from we own area we have the zone with the sugar palm and then we have this fence with very thorny palm to keep the orangutan that we provide with a place to live in the middle and the person apart and inside we have this area for reforestation as a gene bank to keep all that material alive because for the last 12 year not a single seedling of the tropical hardwood tree have grow up because the climatic trigger have disappear all the seed get eat so now we do the monitoring on the inside from tower satellite ultralight each of the family that have sell they land now get a piece of land back and it have two nice fence of tropical hardwood tree you have the shade tree plant in year one then you underplant with the sugar palm and you plant this thorny fence and after a few year you can remove some of that shade tree the person get that acacia timber which we have preserve with the bamboo peel and they can build a house they have some fuel wood to cook with and they can start produce from the tree as many as they like they have enough income for three family but whatever you do in that program it have to be fully support by the person mean that you also have to adjust it to the local cultural value there be no simple one recipe for one place you also have to make sure that it be very difficult to corrupt that it be transparent like here in Samboja Lestari we divide that ring in group of 20 family if one member trespass the agreement and do cut down tree the other 19 member have to decide what be go to happen to he if the group do not take action the other 33 group have to decide what be go to happen to the group that do not comply with that great deal that we be offer they in North Sulawesi it be the cooperative they have a democratic culture there so there you can use the local justice system to protect you system in summary if you look at it in year one the person can sell they land to get income but they get job back in the construction and the reforestation the work with the orangutan and they can use the waste wood to make handicraft they also get free land in between the tree where they can grow they crop they can now sell part of that fruit to the orangutan project they get build material for house a contract for sell the sugar so we can produce huge amount of ethanol and energy locally they get all this other benefit environmentally money they get education it be a great deal and everything be base upon that one thing make sure that forest remain there so if we want to help the orangutan what I actually set out to do we must make sure that the local person be the one that benefit now I think the real key to do it to give a simple answer be integration I hope if you want to know more you can read more applause
