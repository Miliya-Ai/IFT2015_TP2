j napot pac k which as somebody here must surely know mean what be up guy in Magyar that peculiar non indo European language speak by Hungarian for which give the fact that cognitive diversity be at least as threaten as biodiversity on this planet few would have imagine much of a future even a century or two ago but there it be j napot pac k I say somebody here must surely know because despite the fact that there be not that many Hungarian to begin with and the further fact that so far as I know there be not a drop of Hungarian blood in my vein at every critical juncture of my life there have be a Hungarian friend or mentor there beside I I even have dream that take place in landscape I recognize as the landscape of Hungarian film especially the early movie of Miklos Jancso so how do I explain this mysterious affinity maybe it be because my native state of South Carolina which be not much small than present day Hungary once imagine a future for itself as a independent country and as a consequence of that presumption my hometown be burn to the ground by a invade army a experience that have befall many a Hungarian town and village throughout its long and troubled history or maybe it be because when I be a teenager back in the 50 my uncle Henry have denounce the Ku Klux Klan and be bomb for he trouble and have cross burn in he yard live under death threat take he wife and child to Massachusetts for safety and go back to South Carolina to face down the Klan alone that be a very Hungarian thing to do as anyone will attest who remember 1956 and of course from time to time Hungarian have invent they own equivalent of the Klan well it seem to I that this Hungarian presence in my life be difficult to account for but ultimately I ascribe it to a admiration for person with a complex moral awareness with a heritage of guilt and defeat match by defiance and bravado it be not a typical mindset for most American but it be perforce typical of virtually all Hungarian so J napot pac k I go back to South Carolina after some 15 year amid the alien corn at the tail end of the 1960 with the reckless condescension of that era thinking I would save my person never mind the fact that they be slow to acknowledge they need save I labor in that vineyard for a quarter century before make my way to a little kingdom of the just in upstate South Carolina a methodist affiliated institution of high learning call Wofford College I know nothing about Wofford and even less about Methodism but I be reassure on the first day that I teach at Wofford College to find among the auditor in my classroom a 90 year old Hungarian surround by a bevy of middle aged European woman who seem to function as a entourage of Rhinemaidens he name be Sandor Teszler he be a puckish widower whose wife and child be dead and whose grandchild live far away in appearance he resemble Mahatma Gandhi minus the loincloth plus orthopedic boot he have be bear in 1903 in the province of the old Austro Hungarian empire in what later would become Yugoslavia he be ostracize as a child not because he be a Jew he parent be not very religious anyhow but because he have be bear with two club foot a condition which in that day require institutionalization and a succession of painful operation between the age of one and 11 he go to the commercial business high school as a young man in Budapest and there he be as smart as he be modest and he enjoy a considerable success and after graduation when he go into textile engineering the success continue he build one plant after another he marry and have two son he have friend in high place who assure he that he be of great value to the economy once as he have leave instruction to have do he be summon in the middle of the night by the night watchman at one of he plant the night watchman have catch a employee who be steal sock it be a hosiery mill and he simply back a truck up to the loading dock and be shovel in mountain of sock Mr Teszler go down to the plant and confront the thief and say but why do you steal from I if you need money you have only to ask the night watchman see how thing be go and wax indignant say well we be go to call the police be not we but Mr Teszler answer no that will not be necessary he will not steal from we again well maybe he be too trust because he stay where he be long after the Nazi Anschluss in Austria and even after the arrest and deportation begin in Budapest he take the simple precaution of have cyanide capsule place in locket that could be wear about the neck of himself and he family and then one day it happen he and he family be arrest and they be take to a death house on the Danube in that early day of the final solution it be handcraft brutality person be beat to death and they body toss into the river but none who enter that death house have ever come out alive and in a twist you would not believe in a Steven Spielberg film the Gauleiter who be oversee this brutal beating be the very same thief who have steal sock from Mr Teszler hosiery mill it be a brutal beating and midway through that brutality one of Mr Teszler son Andrew look up and say be it time to take the capsule now papa and the Gauleiter who afterwards vanish from this story lean down and whisper into Mr Teszler ear no do not take the capsule help be on the way and then resume the beating but help be on the way and shortly afterwards a car arrive from the Swiss Embassy they be spirited to safety they be reclassify as yugoslav citizen and they manage to stay one step ahead of they pursuer for the duration of the War survive burn and bombing and at the end of the War arrest by the Soviets probably Mr Teszler have get some money into Swiss bank account because he manage to take he family first to Great Britain then to Long Island and then to the center of the textile industry in the American South which as chance would have it be Spartanburg South Carolina the location of Wofford College and there Mr Teszler begin all over again and once again achieve immense success especially after he invent the process for manufacture a new fabric call double knit and then in the late 1950 in the aftermath of Brown v Board of Education when the Klan be resurgent all over the South Mr Teszler say I have hear this talk before and he call he top assistant to he and ask where would you say in this region racism be most virulent well I do not rightly know Mr Teszler I reckon that would be king Mountain Good buy we some land in king Mountain and announce we be go to build a major plant there the man do as he be tell and shortly afterwards Mr Teszler receive a visit from the white mayor of king Mountain now you should know that at that time the textile industry in the South be notoriously segregate the white mayor visit Mr Teszler and say Mr Teszler I trust you be go to be hire a lot of white worker Mr Teszler tell he you bring I the good worker that you can find and if they be good enough I will hire they he also receive a visit from the leader of the black community a minister who say Mr Teszler I sure hope you be go to hire some black worker for this new plant of yours he get the same answer you bring the good worker that you can find and if they be good enough I will hire they as it happen the black minister do he job good than the white mayor but that be neither here or there Mr Teszler hire 16 man eight white eight black they be to be he seed group he future foreman he have install the heavy equipment for he new process in a abandon store in the vicinity of king Mountain and for two month this 16 man would live and work together master the new process he gather they together after a initial tour of that facility and he ask if there be any question there be hem and hawing and shuffling of foot and then one of the white worker step forward and say well yeah we have look at this place and there be only one place to sleep there be only one place to eat there be only one bathroom there be only one water fountain be this plant go to be integrate or what Mr Teszler say you be be pay twice the wages of any other textile worker in this region and this be how we do business do you have any other question no I reckon I do not and two month later when the main plant open and hundred of new worker white and black pour in to see the facility for the first time they be meet by the 16 foreman white and black standing shoulder to shoulder they tour the facility and be ask if there be any question and inevitably the same question arise be this plant integrate or what and one of the white foreman step forward and say you be be pay twice the wages of any other worker in this industry in this region and this be how we do business do you have any other question and there be none in one fall swoop Mr Teszler have integrate the textile industry in that part of the South it be a achievement worthy of Mahatma Gandhi conduct with the shrewdness of a lawyer and the idealism of a saint in he eighty Mr Teszler have retire from the textile industry adopt Wofford College auditing course every semester and because he have a tendency to kiss anything that move become affectionately know as Opi which be Magyar for grandfather by all and sundry before I get there the library of the college have be name for Mr Teszler and after I arrive in 1993 the faculty decide to honor itself by name Mr Teszler Professor of the College partly because at that point he have already take all of the course in the catalog but mainly because he be so conspicuously wise than any one of we to I it be immensely reassure that the preside spirit of this little methodist college in upstate South Carolina be a Holocaust survivor from Central Europe Wise he be indeed but he also have a wonderful sense of humor and once for a interdisciplinary class i be screen the opening segment of Ingmar Bergman the seventh seal as the medieval knight Antonius Block return from the wild goose chase of the Crusades and arrive on the rocky shore of Sweden only to find the specter of death wait for he Mr Teszler sit in the dark with he fellow student and as death open he cloak to embrace the knight in a ghastly embrace I hear Mr Teszler tremulous voice uh oh he say this do not look so good laughter but it be music that be he great passion especially opera and on the first occasion that I visit he house he give I honor of decide what piece of music we would listen to and I delight he by reject Cavalleria Rusticana in favor of Bela Bartok Bluebeard castle I love Bartok music as do Mr Teszler and he have virtually every recording of Bartok music ever issue and it be at he house that I hear for the first time Bartok third piano Concerto and learn from Mr Teszler that it have be compose in nearby Asheville North Carolina in the last year of the composer life he be die of leukemia and he know it and he dedicate this concerto to he wife Dita who be herself a concert pianist and into the slow second movement marked adagio religioso he incorporate the sound of birdsong that he hear outside he window in what he know would be he last spring he be imagine a future for she in which he would play no part and clearly this composition be he final statement to she it be first perform after he death and through she to the world and just as clearly it be say it be okay it be all so beautiful whenever you hear this I will be there it be only after Mr Teszler death that I learn that the marker on the grave of Bela Bartok in Hartsdale New York be pay for by Sandor Teszler J napot Bela not long before Mr Teszler own death at the age of 97 he hear I hold forth on human iniquity I deliver a lecture in which I describe history as on the whole a tidal wave of human suffering and brutality and Mr Teszler come up to I afterwards with gentle reproach and say you know Doctor human being be fundamentally good and I make a vow to myself then and there that if this man who have such cause to think otherwise have reach that conclusion I would not presume to differ until he release I from my vow and now he be dead so I be stick with my vow j napot Sandor I think my skein of Hungarian mentor have come to a end but almost immediately I meet Francis Robicsek a Hungarian doctor actually a heart surgeon in Charlotte North Carolina then in he late seventy who have be a pioneer in open heart surgery and tinker away in he garage behind he house have invent many of the device that be standard part of that procedure he be also a prodigious art collector begin as a intern in Budapest by collect 16th and 17th century dutch art and Hungarian painting and when he come to this country move on to Spanish colonial art Russian icon and finally mayan ceramic he be the author of seven book six of they on mayan ceramic it be he who break the mayan codex enable scholar to relate the pictograph on mayan ceramic to the hieroglyph of the mayan script on the occasion of my first visit we tour he house and we see hundred of work of museum quality and then we pause in front of a closed door and Dr Robicsek say with obvious pride now for the piece De resistance and he open the door and we walk into a windowless 20 by 20 foot room with shelf from floor to ceiling and cram on every shelf he collection of mayan ceramic now I know absolutely nothing about mayan ceramic but I want to be as ingratiating as possible so I say but Dr Robicsek this be absolutely dazzling yes he say that be what the Louvre say they would not leave I alone until I let they have a piece but it be not a good one laughter well it occur to I that I should invite Dr Robicsek to lecture at Wofford College on what else Leonardo da Vinci and further I should invite he to meet my old trustee who have major in French history at Yale some 70 odd year before and at 89 still rule the world large privately own textile empire with a iron hand he name be Roger Milliken and Mr Milliken agree and Dr Robicsek agree and Dr Robicsek visit and deliver the lecture and it be a dazzling success and afterwards we convene at the President House with Dr Robicsek on one hand Mr Milliken on the other and it be only at that moment as we be sit down to dinner that I recognize the enormity of the risk I have create because to bring this two titan this two master of the universe together it be like introduce Mothra to Godzilla over the skyline of Tokyo if they do not like each other we could all get trample to death but they do they do like each other they get along famously until the very end of the meal and then they get into a furious argument and what they be argue about be this whether the second Harry Potter movie be as good as the first laughter Mr Milliken say it be not Dr Robicsek disagree I be still try to take in the notion that this titan this master of the universe in they spare time watch Harry Potter movie when Mr Milliken think he would win the argument by say you just think it be so good because you do not read the book and Dr Robicsek reel back in he chair but quickly gather he wit lean forward and say well that be true but I will bet you go to the movie with a grandchild well yes I do concede Mr Milliken aha say Dr Robicsek I go to the movie all by myself laughter applause and I realize in this moment of revelation that what this two man be reveal be the secret of they extraordinary success each in he own right and it lay precisely in that insatiable curiosity that irrepressible desire to know no matter what the subject no matter what the cost even at a time when the keeper of the Doomsday clock be willing to bet even money that the human race will not be around to imagine anything in the year 2100 a scant 93 year from now live each day as if it be you last say Mahatma Gandhi learn as if you will live forever this be what I be passionate about it be precisely this it be this inextinguishable undaunted appetite for learning and experience no matter how risible no matter how esoteric no matter how seditious it might seem this define the imagine future of we fellow Hungarian Robicsek Teszler and Bartok as it do my own as it do I suspect that of everybody here to which I need only add Ez a mi munkank e nem be keve this be we task we know it will be hard Ez a mi munkank e nem be keve j napot pac k applause
