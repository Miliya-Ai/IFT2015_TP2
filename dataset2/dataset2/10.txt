I be go to take you on a journey very quickly to explain the wish I be go to have to take you somewhere where many person have not be and that be around the world when I be about 24 year old Kate Stohr and myself start a organization to get architect and designer involve in humanitarian work not only about respond to natural disaster but involve in systemic issue we believe that where the resource and expertise be scarce innovative sustainable design can really make a difference in person life so I start my life as a architect or training as a architect and I be always interested in socially responsible design and how you can really make a impact but when I go to architecture school it seem that I be a black sheep in the family many architect seem to think that when you design you design a jewel and it be a jewel that you try and crave for whereas I feel that when you design you either improve or you create a detriment to the community in which you be design so you be not just do a building for the resident or for the person who be go to use it but for the community as a whole and in 1999 we start by respond to the issue of the housing crisis for return refugee in Kosovo and I do not know what I be do like I say mid 20 and I be the internet generation so we start a website we put a call out there and to my surprise in a couple of month we have hundred of entry from around the world that lead to a number of prototype be build and really experiment with some idea two year later we start do a project on develop mobile health clinic in sub Saharan Africa respond to the HIV AIDS pandemic that lead to 550 entry from 53 country we also have designer from around the world that participate and we have a exhibit of work that follow that 2004 be the tip point for we we start respond to natural disaster and get involve in Iran in bam also follow up on we work in Africa Working within the United States most person look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner but I live in Bozeman Montana go up to the north plain on the reservation or go down to Alabama or Mississippi pre Katrina and I could have show you place that have far bad condition than many develop country that I have be to so we get involve in and work in inner city and elsewhere and also I will go into some more project 2005 Mother Nature kick we ass I think we can pretty much assume that 2005 be a horrific year when it come to natural disaster and because of the internet and because of connection to blog and so forth within literally hour of the tsunami we be already raise fund get involve work with person on the ground we run from a couple of laptop and in the first couple of day I have 4 000 email from person need help so we begin to get involve in project there and I will talk about some other and then of course this year we have be respond to Katrina as well as follow up on we reconstruction work so this be a brief overview in 2004 I really could not manage the number of person who want to help or the number of request that I be get it be all come into my laptop and cell phone so we decide to embrace a open source model of business so that anyone anywhere in the world could start a local chapter and they can get involve in local problem because I believe there be no such thing as Utopia all problem be local all solution be local so that mean you know somebody who be base in Mississippi know more about Mississippi than I do so what happen be we use Meetup and all this other internet tool and we end up have 40 chapter start up thousand of architect in 104 country so the bullet point sorry I never do a suit so I know that I be go to take this off ok because I be go to do it very quick this be not just about nonprofit what it show I be that there be a grassroots movement go on of socially responsible designer who really believe that this world have get a lot small and that we have the opportunity not the responsibility but the opportunity to really get involve in make change laughter laughter I be add that to my time laughter so what you do not know be we have get this thousand of designer work around the world connect basically by a website and we have a staff of three the fact that nobody tell we we could not do it we do it and so there be something to be say about to vet so seven year later we have develop so that we have get advocacy instigation and implementation we advocate for good design not only through student workshop and lecture and public forum op ed we have a book on humanitarian work but also disaster mitigation and deal with public policy we can talk about FEMA but that be another talk instigation develop idea with community and NGOs do open source design competition refer matchmaking with community and then implement actually go out there and do the work because when you invent it be never a reality until it be build so it be really important that if we be design and try to create change we build that change so here be a select number of project Kosovo this be Kosovo in 99 we do a open design competition like I say it lead to a whole variety of idea and this be not about emergency shelter but transitional shelter that would last five to 10 year that would be place next to the land the resident live in and that they would rebuild they own home this be not impose a architecture on a community this be give they the tool and the space to allow they to rebuild and regrow the way they want to we have from the sublime to the ridiculous but they work this be a inflatable hemp house it be build it work this be a shipping container build and work and a whole variety of idea that not only deal with architectural building but also the issue of governance and the idea of create community through complex network so we have engage not just designer but also a whole variety of technology base professional use rubble from destroy home to create new home use straw bale construction create heat wall and then something remarkable happen in 99 we go to Africa originally to look at the housing issue within three day we realize the problem be not house it be the grow pandemic of HIV AIDS and it be not doctor tell we this it be actual villager that we be stay with and so we come up with the bright idea that instead of get person to walk 10 15 kilometer to see doctor you get the doctor to the person and we start engage the medical community and you know we think we be real bright spark we have come up with this great idea mobile health clinic widely distribute throughout sub Saharan Africa and the medical community there say we have say this for the last decade we know this we just do not know how to show this so in a way we have take pre exist need and show solution and so again we have a whole variety of idea that come in this one I personally love because the idea be that architecture be not just about solution but about raise awareness this be a kenaf clinic you get seed and you grow it in a plot of land and it grow 14 foot in a month and on the fourth week the doctor come and they mow out a area put a tensile structure on the top and when the doctor have finish treat and see patient and villager you cut down the clinic and you eat it it be a eat you own clinic so it be deal with the fact that if you have AIDS you also need to have nutrition rate and the idea of nutrition be as important as get antiretroviral out there so you know this be a serious solution this one I love the idea be it be not just a clinic it be a community center this look at set up trade route and economic engine within the community so it can be a self sustain project every one of this project be sustainable that be not because I be a tree hug green person it be because when you live on four dollar a day you be live on survival and you have to be sustainable you have to know where you energy be come from you have to know where you resource be come from and you have to keep the maintenance down so this be about get a economic engine and then at night it turn into a movie theater so it be not a AIDS clinic it be a community center so you can see idea and this idea develop into prototype and they be eventually build and currently as of this year there be clinic roll out in Nigeria and Kenya from that we also develop Siyathemba the community come to we and say the problem be that the girl do not have education and we be work in a area where young woman between the age of 16 and 24 have a 50 percent HIV AIDS rate and that be not because they be promiscuous it be because there be no knowledge and so we decide to look at the idea of sport and create a youth sport center that double as a HIV AIDS outreach center and the coach of the girl team be also train doctor so that there would be a very slow way of develop confidence in health care and we pick nine finalist and then that nine finalist be distribute throughout the entire region and then the community pick they design they say this be we design because it be not only about engage a community it be about empower a community and about get they to be a part of the rebuilding process so the win design be here and then of course we actually go and work with the community and the client so this be the designer he be out there work with the first ever woman soccer team in KwaZulu Natal Siyathemba and they can tell it good a cappella singing in a south African language video well my name be Cee Cee Mkhonza I work at the Africa Centre I be a it user consultant I be also the national football player for South Africa Banyana Banyana and I also play in the Vodacom League for the team call Tembisa which have now change to Siyathemba this be we home grind Cameron Sinclair I be go to show that later because I be run out of time I can see Chris look at I slyly this be a connection just a meeting with somebody who want to develop Africa first telemedicine center in Tanzania and we meet literally a couple of month ago we have already develop a design the team be over there work in partnership this be a matchmaking thanks to a couple of tedster Sun Microsystems Cheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli who connect I with this amazing African woman and we start construction in June and it will be open by TEDGlobal so when you come to TEDGlobal you can check it out but what we be know probably most for be deal with disaster and development and we have be involve in a lot of issue such as the tsunami and also thing like Hurricane Katrina this be a 370 dollar shelter that can be easily assemble this be a community design community center and what that mean be we actually live and work with the community and they be part of the design process the kid actually get involve in map out where the community center should be and then eventually the community through skill train end up build the building with we here be another school this be what the UN give this guy for six month 12 plastic tarp this be in August this be the replacement that be suppose to last for two year when the rain come down you can not hear a thing and in the summer it be about 140 degree inside so we say if the rain come down let get fresh water so every one of we school have a rainwater collection system very low cost three classroom and rainwater collection be 5 000 dollar this be raise by hot chocolate sale in Atlanta it be build by the parent of the kid the kid be out there on site build the building and it open a couple of week ago and there be 600 kid that be now use the school applause so disaster hit home we see the bad story on CNN and Fox and all that but we do not see the good story here be a community that get together and they say no to wait they form a partnership a diverse partnership of player to actually map out East Biloxi to figure out who be get involve we have have over 1 500 volunteer rebuild rehabb home figure out what FEMA regulation be not wait for they to dictate to we how you should rebuild Working with resident get they out of they home so they do not get ill this be what they be clean up on they own Designing housing this house be go in in a couple of week this be a rehabb home do in four day this be a utility room for a woman who be on a walker she be 70 year old this be what FEMA give she 600 buck happen two day ago we put together very quickly a washroom it be build it be run and she just start a business today where she be wash other person clothes this be the Calhouns they be photographer who have document the Lower Ninth for the last 40 year that be they home and this be the photograph they take and we be help work with they to create a new building project we have do Projects we have be a part of support why do not aid agency do this this be the UN tent this be the new UN tent just introduce this year Quick to assemble it be get a flap that be the invention it take 20 year to design this and get it implement in the field I be 12 year old there be a problem here luckily we be not alone there be hundred and hundred and hundred and hundred and hundred of architect and designer and inventor around the world that be get involve in humanitarian work more hemp house it be a theme in Japan apparently I be not sure what they be smoke laughter this be a grip clip design by somebody who say all you need be some way to attach membrane structure to physical support beam this guy design for NASA be now do housing I be go to whip through this quickly because I know I have get only a couple of minute so this be all do in the last two year I show you something that take 20 year to do and this be just a selection of thing that be build in the last couple of year from Brazil to India Mexico Alabama China Israel Palestine Vietnam the average age of a designer who get involve in this project be 32 that be how old I be so it be a young I just have to stop here because Arup be in the room and this be the good design toilet in the world if you be ever ever in India go use this toilet laughter Chris Luebkeman will tell you why I be sure that be how he want to spend the party but the future be not go to be the sky scrape city of New York but this and when you look at this you see crisis what I see be many many inventor one billion person live in abject poverty we hear about they all the time four billion live in grow but fragile economy one in seven live in unplanned settlement if we do nothing about the housing crisis that be about to happen in 20 year one in three person will live in a unplanned settlement or a refugee camp look leave look right one of you will be there how do we improve the living standard of five billion person with 10 million solution so I wish to develop a community that actively embrace innovative and sustainable design to improve the living condition for everyone Chris Anderson wait a sec that be you wish c that be my wish CA that be he wish applause c we start Architecture for Humanity with 700 dollar and a website so Chris somehow decide to give I 100 000 so why not this many person open source architecture be the way to go you have a diverse community of participant and we be not just talk about inventor and designer but we be talk about the funding model my role be not as a designer it be as a conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world and what we need be something that replicate I globally because I have not sleep in seven year laughter secondly what will this thing be designer want to respond to issue of humanitarian crisis but they do not want some company in the West take they idea and basically profit from it so creative Commons have develop the develop nation license and what that mean be that a designer can the Siyathemba project I show be the first ever build to have a creative Commons license on it as soon as that be build anyone in Africa or any develop nation can take the construction document and replicate it for free applause so why not allow designer the opportunity to do this but still protect they right here we want to have a community where you can upload idea and that idea can be test in a earthquake in flood in all sort of austere environment the reason that be important be I do not want to wait for the next Katrina to find out if my house work that be too late we need to do it now so do that globally and I want this whole thing to work multi lingually when you look at the face of a architect most person think a gray haired white guy I do not see that I see the face of the world so I want everyone from all over the planet to be able to be a part of this design and development the idea of need base competition xprize for the other 98 percent if you want to call it that we also want to look at way of matchmaking and put funding partner together and the idea of integrate manufacturer fab lab in every country when I hear about the 100 laptop and it be go to educate every child educate every designer in the world put one in every favela every slum settlement because you know what Innovation will happen and I need to know that it be call the leap back we talk about leapfrog technology I write with worldchanging and the one thing we have be talk about be I learn more on the ground than I have ever learn here so let take that idea adapt they and we can use they this idea be suppose to be adaptable they should have the potential for evolution they should be develop by every nation in the world and useful for every nation in the world what will it take there should be a sheet I do not have time to read this because I be go to be yank off CA let just leave it up for a sec c well what will it take you guy be smart so it be go to take a lot of compute power because I want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system and be able to not only participate in develop this design but utilize the design also a process of review the design I want every Arup engineer in the world to check and make sure that we be do stuff that be stand because that guy be the good in the world Plug and so you know I want this I just should note I have two laptop and one of they be there and that have 3000 design on it if I drop that laptop what happen so it be important to have this prove idea put up there easy to use easy to get ahold of my mom once say there be nothing bad than be all mouth and no trousers laughter I be feed up of talk about make change you only make it by do it we have change FEMA guideline we have change public policy we have change international response base on build thing so for I it be important that we create a real conduit for innovation and that it be free innovation think of free culture this be free innovation somebody say this a couple of year back I will give point for that who know it but I think the man be maybe 25 year too early so let do it thank you applause
