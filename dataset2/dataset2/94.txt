I be a vicar in the Church of England I have be a priest in the Church for 20 year for most of that time I have be struggle and grapple with question about the nature of God who be God and I be very aware that when you say the word God many person will turn off immediately and most person both within and outside the organized church still have a picture of a celestial controller a rule maker a policeman in the sky who order everything and cause everything to happen he will protect he own person and answer the prayer of the faithful and in the worship of my church the most frequently use adjective about God be almighty but I have a problem with that I have become more and more uncomfortable with this perception of God over the year do we really believe that God be the kind of male boss that we have be present in we worship and in we liturgy over all this year of course there have be thinker who have suggest different way of look at God explore the feminine nurture side of divinity suggest that God express himself or Herself through powerlessness rather than power acknowledge that God be unknown and unknowable by definition find deep resonance with other religion and philosophy and way of look at life as part of what be a universal and global search for mean this idea be well know in liberal academic circle but clergy like myself have be reluctant to air they for fear of create tension and division in we church community for fear of upsetting the simple faith of more traditional believer I have choose not to rock the boat then on December 26th last year just two month ago that underwater earthquake trigger the tsunami and two week later Sunday morning 9th of January I find myself stand in front of my congregation intelligent well mean mostly thoughtful Christian person and I need to express on they behalf we feel and we question I have my own personal response but I also have a public role and something need to be say and this be what I say shortly after the tsunami I read a newspaper article write by the archbishop of Canterbury fine title about the tragedy in Southern Asia the essence of what he say be this the person most affect by the devastation and loss of life do not want intellectual theory about how God let this happen he write if some religious genius do come up with a explanation of exactly why all this death make sense would we feel happy or safe or more confident in God if the man in the photograph that appear in the newspaper hold the hand of he dead child be stand in front of we now there be no word that we could say to he a verbal response would not be appropriate the only appropriate response would be a compassionate silence and some kind of practical help it be not a time for explanation or preaching or theology it be a time for tear this be true and yet here we be my church in Oxford semi detach from event that happen a long way away but with we faith bruise and we want a explanation from God we demand a explanation from God some have conclude that we can only believe in a God who share we pain in some way God must feel the anguish and grief and physical pain that we feel in some way the eternal God must be able to enter into the soul of human being and experience the torment within and if this be true it must also be that God know the joy and exaltation of the human spirit as well we want a God who can weep with that who weep and rejoice with that who rejoice this seem to I both a deeply move and a convincing re statement of Christian belief about God for hundred of year the prevail orthodoxy the accept truth be that God the Father the Creator be unchanging and therefore by definition can not feel pain or sadness now the unchanging God feel a bit cold and indifferent to I and the devastating event of the 20th century have force person to question the cold unfeeling God the slaughter of million in the trench and in the death camp have cause person to ask where be God in all this who be God in all this and the answer be God be in this with we or God do not deserve we allegiance anymore if God be a bystander observe but not involve then God may well exist but we do not want to know about he many Jews and Christian now feel like this I know and I be among they so we have a suffer God a God who be intimately connect with this world and with every living soul I very much relate to this idea of God but it be not enough I need to ask some more question and I hope they be question that you will want to ask as well some of you over the last few week I have be strike by the number of time that word in we worship have feel a bit inappropriate a bit dodgy we have a pram service on Tuesday morning for mum and they pre school child and last week we sing with the child one of they favorite song the Wise man build he House upon the Rock perhaps some of you know it some of the word go like this the foolish man build he house upon the sand and the flood come up and the house on the sand go crash then in the same week at a funeral we sing the familiar hymn we plow the Fields and scatter a very English hymn in the second verse come the line the wind and wave obey he do they I do not feel we can sing that song again in church after what be happen so the first big question be about control do God have a plan for each of we be God in control do God order each moment do the wind and the wave obey he from time to time one hear Christian tell the story of how God organize thing for they so that everything work out all right some difficulty overcome some illness cure some trouble avert a parking space find at a crucial time I can remember someone say this to I with she eye shine with enthusiasm at this wonderful confirmation of she faith and the goodness of God but if God can or will do this thing intervene to change the flow of event then surely he could have stop the tsunami do we have a local God who can do little thing like parking space but not big thing like 500 mile per hour wave that be just not acceptable to intelligent Christian and we must acknowledge it either God be responsible for the tsunami or God be not in control after the tragedy survival story begin to emerge you probably hear some of they the man who surf the wave the teenage girl who recognize the danger because she have just be learn about tsunami at school then there be the congregation who have leave they usual church building on the shore to hold a service in the hill the preacher deliver a extra long sermon so that they be still out of harm way when the wave strike afterwards someone say that God must have be look after they so the next question be about partiality can we earn God favor by worship he or believe in he do God demand loyalty like any medieval tyrant a God who look after he own so that Christian be ok while everyone else perish a cosmic we and they and a God who be guilty of the bad kind of favoritism that would be appalling and that would be the point at which I would hand in my membership such a God would be morally inferior to the high ideal of humanity so who be God if not the great puppet master or the tribal protector perhaps God allow or permit terrible thing to happen so that heroism and compassion can be show perhaps God be test we test we charity or we faith perhaps there be a great cosmic plan that allow for horrible suffering so that everything will work out ok in the end perhaps but this idea be all just variation on God control everything the supreme commander toy with expendable unit in a great campaign we be still leave with a God who can do the tsunami and allow Auschwitz in he great novel the Brothers Karamazov Dostoevsky give this word to Ivan address to he naive and devout young brother Alyosha if the suffering of child go to make up the sum of suffering which be necessary for the purchase of truth then I say beforehand that the entire truth be not worth such a price we can not afford to pay so much for admission it be not God that I do not accept I merely most respectfully return he the ticket or perhaps God set the whole universe go at the beginning and then relinquish control forever so that natural process could occur and evolution run its course this seem more acceptable but it still leave God with the ultimate moral responsibility be God a cold unfeeling spectator or a powerless lover watch with infinite compassion thing God be unable to control or change be God intimately involve in we suffer so that he feel it in he own be if we believe something like this we must let go of the puppet master completely take we leave of the almighty controller abandon traditional model we must think again about God maybe God do not do thing at all maybe God be not a agent like all of we be agent early religious thought conceive God as a sort of superhuman person do thing all over the place beat up the Egyptian drown they in the Red Sea waste city get angry the person know they God by he mighty act but what if God do not act what if God do not do thing at all what if God be in thing the loving soul of the universe a in dwell compassionate presence underpinning and sustain all thing what if God be in thing in the infinitely complex network of relationship and connection that make up life in the natural cycle of life and death the creation and destruction that must happen continuously in the process of evolution in the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world in the collective unconscious the soul of the human race in you in I mind and body and spirit in the tsunami in the victim in the depth of thing in presence and in absence in simplicity and complexity in change and development and growth how do this in ness this innerness this interiority of God work it be hard to conceive and beg more question be God just another name for the universe with no independent existence at all I do not know to what extent can we ascribe personality to God I do not know in the end we have to say I do not know if we know God would not be God to have faith in this God would be more like trust a essential benevolence in the universe and less like believe a system of doctrinal statement be not it ironic that Christian who claim to believe in a infinite unknowable be then tie God down in closed system and rigid doctrine how could one practice such a faith by seek the God within by cultivate my own inwardness in silence in meditation in my inner space in the i that remain when I gently put aside my pass emotion and idea and preoccupation in awareness of the inner conversation and how would we live such a faith how would I live such a faith by seek intimate connection with you inwardness the kind of relationship when deep speak to deep if God be in all person then there be a meeting place where my relationship with you become a three way encounter there be a Indian greeting which I be sure some of you know Namaste accompany by a respectful bow which roughly translate means that which be of God in I greet that which of God be in you Namaste and how would one deepen such a faith by seek the inwardness which be in all thing in music and poetry in the natural world of beauty and in the small ordinary thing of life there be a deep indwelling presence that make they extraordinary it need a profound attentiveness and a patient wait a contemplative attitude and a generosity and openness to that whose experience be different from my own when I stand up to speak to my person about God and the tsunami I have no answer to offer they no neat package of faith with Bible reference to prove they only doubt and question and uncertainty I have some suggestion to make possible new way of think about God Ways that might allow we to go on down a new and uncharted road but in the end the only thing I could say for sure be I do not know and that just might be the most profoundly religious statement of all thank you
