in the next 18 minute I be go to take you on a journey and it be a journey that you and I have be on for many year now and it begin some 50 year ago when human first step off we planet and in that 50 year not only do we literally physically set foot on the moon but we have dispatch robotic spacecraft to all the planet all eight of they and we have land on asteroid we have rendezvous with comet and at this point in time we have a spacecraft on its way to Pluto the body formerly know as a planet and all of this robotic mission be part of a big human journey a voyage to understand something to get a sense of we cosmic place to understand something of we origin and how Earth we planet and we live on it come to be and of all the place in the solar system that we might go to and search for answer to question like this there be Saturn and we have be to Saturn before we visit Saturn in the early 1980 but we investigation of Saturn have become far more in depth in detail since the Cassini spacecraft travel across interplanetary space for seven year glide into orbit around Saturn in the summer of 2004 and become at that point the farth robotic outpost that humanity have ever establish around the Sun now the Saturn system be a rich planetary system it offer mystery scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare and the investigation of this system have enormous cosmic reach in fact just study the ring alone we stand to learn a lot about the disc of star and gas that we call the spiral galaxy and here be a beautiful picture of the Andromeda Nebula which be we close large spiral galaxy to the Milky Way and then here be a beautiful composite of the Whirlpool Galaxy take by the Hubble Space Telescope so the journey back to Saturn be really part of and be also a metaphor for a much large human voyage to understand the interconnectedness of everything around we and also how human fit into that picture and it pain I that I can not tell you all that we have learn with Cassini I can not show you all the beautiful picture that we have take in the last two and a half year because I simply do not have the time so I be go to concentrate on two of the most exciting story that have emerge out of this major exploratory expedition that we be conduct around Saturn and have be for the past two and a half year Saturn be accompany by a very large and diverse collection of moon they range in size from a few kilometer across to as big across as the U S Most of the beautiful picture we have take of Saturn in fact show Saturn in accompaniment with some of its moon here be Saturn with Dione and then here be Saturn show the ring edge on show you just how vertically thin they be with the moon Enceladus now two of the 47 moon that Saturn have be standout and that be Titan and Enceladus Titan be Saturn large moon and until Cassini have arrive there be the large single expanse of unexplored terrain that we have remain in we solar system and it be a body that have long intrigued person who have watch the planet it have a very large thick atmosphere and in fact its surface environment be believe to be more like the environment we have here on the Earth or at least have in the past than any other body in the solar system its atmosphere be largely molecular nitrogen like you be breathe here in this room except that its atmosphere be suffuse with simple organic material like methane and propane and ethane and this molecule high up in the atmosphere of Titan get break down and they product join together to make haze particle this haze be ubiquitous it be completely global and envelop Titan and that be why you can not see down to the surface with we eye in the visible region of the spectrum but this haze particle it be surmise before we get there with Cassini over billion and billion of year gently drift down to the surface and coat the surface in a thick organic sludge so like the equivalent the Titan equivalent of tar or oil or what we do not know what but this be what we suspect and this molecule especially methane and ethane can be liquid at the surface temperature of Titan and so it turn out that methane be to titan what water be to the Earth it be a condensable in the atmosphere and so recognize this circumstance bring to the fore a whole world of bizarre possibility you can have methane cloud ok and above that cloud you have this hundred of kilometer of haze which prevent any sunlight from get to the surface the temperature at the surface be some 350 degree below zero Fahrenheit but despite that cold you could have rain fall down on the surface of Titan and do on Titan what rain do on the Earth it carve gully it form river and cataract it can create canyon it can pool in large basin and crater it can wash the sludge off high mountain peak and hill down into the lowland so stop and think for a minute try to imagine what the surface of Titan might look like it be dark high noon on Titan be as dark as deep earth twilight on the Earth it be cold it be eerie it be misty it might be rain and you might be stand on the shore of Lake Michigan brim with paint thin laughter that be the view that we have of the surface of Titan before we get there with Cassini and I can tell you that what we have find on Titan though it be not the same in detail be every bit as fascinating as that story be and for we it have be like the Cassini person it have be like a Jules Verne adventure come true as I say it have a thick extensive atmosphere this be a picture of Titan backlit by the Sun with the ring as a beautiful backdrop and yet another moon there I do not even know which one it be it be a very extensive atmosphere we have instrument on Cassini which can see down to the surface through this atmosphere and my camera system be one of they and we have take picture like this and what you see be bright and dark region and that be about as far as it get for we it be so mystifying we could not make out what we be see on Titan when you look close at this region you start to see thing like sinuous channel we do not know you see a few round thing this we later find out be in fact a crater but there be very few crater on the surface of Titan mean it be a very young surface and there be feature that look tectonic they look like they have be pull apart whenever you see anything linear on a planet it mean there be be a fracture like a fault and so it be be tectonically alter but we could not make sense of we image until six month after we get into orbit a event occur that many have regard as the highlight of Cassini investigation of Titan and that be the deployment of the Huygens probe the European build Huygens probe that Cassini have carry for seven year across the solar system we deploy it to the atmosphere of Titan it take two and a half hour to descend and it land on the surface and I just want to emphasize how significant a event this be this be a device of human making and it land in the outer solar system for the first time in human history it be so significant that in my mind this be a event that should have be celebrate with ticker tape parade in every city across the U S and Europe and sadly that be not the case laughter it be significant for another reason this be a international mission and this event be celebrate in Europe in Germany and the celebratory presentation be give in English accent and American accent and German accent and French and Italian and dutch accent it be a move demonstration of what the word united nation be suppose to mean a true union of nation join together in a colossal effort for good and in this case it be a massive undertaking to explore a planet and to come to understand a planetary system that for all of human history have be unreachable and now human have actually touch it so it be I mean I be get goose bump just talk about it it be a tremendously emotional event and it be something that I will personally never forget and you should not either applause but anyway the probe take measurement of the atmosphere on the way down and it also take panoramic picture and I can not tell you what it be like to see the first picture of Titan surface from the probe and this be what we see and it be a shocker because it be everything we want that other picture take from orbit to be it be a unambiguous pattern a geological pattern it be a dendritic drainage pattern that can be form only by the flow of liquid and you can follow this channel and you can see how they all converge and they converge into this channel here which drain into this region you be look at a shoreline be this a shoreline of fluid we do not know but this be somewhat of a shoreline this picture be take at 16 kilometer this be the picture take at eight kilometer ok again the shoreline okay now 16 kilometer eight kilometer this be roughly a airline altitude if you be go to take a airplane trip across the U S you would be fly at this altitude so this be the picture you would have at the window of Titanian Airlines as you fly across the surface of Titan laughter and then finally the probe come to rest on the surface and I be go to show you lady and gentleman the first picture ever take from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system and here be the horizon ok this be probably water ice pebble yes applause and obviously it land in one of this flat dark region and it do not sink out of sight so it be not fluid that we land in what the probe come down in be basically the Titan equivalent of a mud flat this be a unconsolidated ground that be suffuse with liquid methane and it be probably the case that this material have wash off the highland of Titan through this channel that we see and have drain over billion of year to fill in low lie basin and that be what the Huygens probe land in but still there be no sign in we image or even in the Huygens image of any large open body of fluid where be they it get even more puzzling when we find dune ok so this be we movie of the equatorial region of Titan show this dune this be dune that be 100 meter tall separate by a few kilometer and they go on for mile and mile and mile there be hundr up to a 1 000 or 1 200 mile of dune this be the Saharan desert of Titan it be obviously a place which be very dry or you would not get dune so again it get puzzle that there be no body of fluid until finally we see lake in the polar region and there be a lake scene in the south polar region of Titan it be about the size of Lake Ontario and then only a week and a half ago we fly over the north pole of Titan and find again we find a feature here the size of the Caspian Sea so it seem that the liquid for some reason we do not understand or during at least this season be apparently at the pole of Titan and I think you would agree that we have find Titan be a remarkable mystical place it be exotic it be alien but yet strangely Earth like and have Earth like geological formation and a tremendous geographical diversity and be a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system for complexity and richness be the Earth itself and so now we go onto Enceladus Enceladus be a small moon it be about a tenth the size of Titan and you can see it here next to England just to show you the size this be not mean to be a threat laughter and enceladus be very white it be very bright and its surface be obviously wreck with fracture it be a very geologically active body but the mother lode of discovery on Enceladus be find at the south pole and we be look at the south pole here where we find this system of fracture and they be a different color because they be a different composition they be coat this fracture be coat with organic material moreover this whole entire region the south polar region have elevate temperature it be the hot place on the planet on the body that be as bizarre as find that the Antarctic on the Earth be hot than the tropics and then when we take additional picture we discover that from this fracture be issue jet of fine icy particle extend hundred of mile into space and when we color code this image to bring out the faint light level we see that this jet feed a plume that in fact we see in other image go thousand of mile into the space above Enceladus my team and I have examine image like this and like this one and have think about the other result from Cassini and we have arrive at the conclusion that this jet may be erupt from pocket of liquid water under the surface of Enceladus so we have possibly liquid water organic material and excess heat in other word we have possibly stumble upon the holy grail of modern day planetary exploration or in other word a environment that be potentially suitable for live organism and I do not think I need to tell you that the discovery of life elsewhere in we solar system whether it be on Enceladus or elsewhere would have enormous cultural and scientific implication because if we could demonstrate that genesis have occur not once but twice independently in we solar system then that mean by inference it have occur a staggering number of time throughout the universe and its 13 7 billion year history right now Earth be the only planet still that we know be teem with life it be precious it be unique it be still so far the only home we have ever know and if any of you be alert and coherent during the 1960 and we would forgive you if you be not ok you would remember this very famous picture take by the Apollo 8 astronaut in 1968 it be the first time that Earth be image from space and it have a enormous impact on we sense of place in the universe and we sense of responsibility for the protection of we own planet well we on Cassini have take a equivalent first a picture that no human eye have ever see before it be a total eclipse of the Sun see from the other side of Saturn and in this impossibly beautiful picture you see the main ring backlit by the Sun you see the refract image of the Sun and you see this ring create in fact by the exhalation of Enceladus but as if that be not brilliant enough we can spot in this beautiful image sight of we own planet cradle in the arm of Saturn ring now there be something deeply move about see ourselves from afar and capture the sight of we little blue ocean planet in the sky of other world and that and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that may be in the end the fine reward that we earn from this journey of discovery that start half a century ago and thank you very much applause
