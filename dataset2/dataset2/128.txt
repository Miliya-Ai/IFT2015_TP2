welcome to Africa or rather I should say welcome home because this be where it all really begin be not it look at fossil date back several million of year it all point to evidence that life for the human species as we know it begin right here we be on a amazing journey the next four day you be go to hear story of Africa the Next chapter fantastic tale anecdote from speaker but I want to turn that upside down for a moment and get something out on the table and clear the air so to say what be the bad thing you have ever hear about Africa and this be not a rhetorical question I actually want answer from you go for it the bad famine corruption more genocide AIDS Slavery that be enough we have all hear this thing but this be about Africa the story we have not hear the story that we want to know and the story that do exist about positive tale a part of my talk be go to be about investment opportunity that exist on this continent to separate the rhetoric from the reality the fact from the fiction to go to the actual datum and statistics that exist about the actual thing that be happen on the ground that make Africa a realistic investment opportunity and option for you so let get go because Africa to some degree be on a turnaround a turnaround in term of how it manage its image and how it take control of its own destiny and turnaround be part and parcel of what I have focus on for most of my professional career and it all start almost a decade ago as a young consultant at McKinsey Company at they first African office in Johannesburg and there we work with lead ceo on African issue and African company on turnaround make the company not just the good in Africa but the good globally but I really formalize this focus on turnaround when I be complete my mba in the United States it all begin with a fantastic phone call it be from Rosabeth Moss Kanter Harvard Business School guru and a professor of mine and she say I want to write a case Euvin a case on a public sector leader that have lesson for the corporate world and the leader that come to mind be Nelson Mandela because Nelson Mandela as he take over power as the first democratically elect president of South Africa face a situation of a country that could have slide into the abyss of chaos but he start the country on a path of a positive cycle now the case Nelson Mandela Change Leader become part of the research base for a chapter in Rosabeth new book call confidence and confidence become a New York Times bestseller and top Business Week hardcover bestseller list and why I tell you this story be because later when I be interview on SABC Africa on a pan African broadcast they ask what be you key lesson or the key thing you enjoy the most because it be a huge privilege to be part of such a project the lesson from that be that it be Africa a African story that be use to share news with the rest of the world of what the benchmark can be for corporate turnaround Africa be be use as a success story so I want to share with you a personal story about a turnaround or a transformation and that have to do with I because in 1994 I pack a few thing into a backpack and head off for a year of travel in the middle of my university career you should have see my parent reaction laughter but very soon I find myself from the southern part of Africa in South Africa at the very north in Egypt and I seek out the most remote place I go to the Siwa Oasis that be one of my stop and the Siwa Oasis be famous for several thing but the key thing be that it be the place that Alexander the Great go to when he want to find out what he destiny have in store for he and legend have it that Alexander trek through this desert half he battalion be wipe out in the sandstorm and myth say that he have a audience with the oracle and it foretell he destiny of greatness this be 300 bc so Africa have long be see as a place to go to for answer now the thing I remember about Siwa be the magical view of the sky at night with no natural light source Siva be one of this amazing place that when you look up you see a perfect tapestry fast forward to 2002 I be sit in Cambridge Massachusetts at the Healthcare Development Conference and I see the same picture but from the opposite side a satellite picture look down at the earth and it be that picture that make such a profound impact on I because I will never forget it I remember the very moment and I want to share that image with you of what I see at that point the first thing that I see be North America at night glow in all its glory a warm feeling light and then I see it Africa quite literally the Dark Continent and while Africa may be dark the thing that bring the message home to I be that this be the challenge we be face but it be also the opportunity because whilst Africa may be dark other than the few speck that exist north and in the south and other area it be aglow with the light in the heart of the million of person that be there entrepreneur dynamic person person with hope it be George Kimble the geographer who say that the only thing dark about Africa be we ignorance of it so let start shed light on this amazing eclectic continent that have so much to offer let start unpack it Africa be the second large continent a landmass second from Asia it also be the second most populated continent with 900 million person in fact come back to the land mass Africa be so big that you could fit in the continental United States China and the entire Europe into Africa and still have space Africa be home to over 1 000 language 2 000 be another estimate that be out there with over 2 000 language and dialect but you could say Invest in Africa in over 1 000 language and it would not make a difference what do the datum say as a investment banker I be in the cross flow of information and the change that be take place in capital market so I want to share with you some of this bellwether signal or sign and wind of change that be sweep this continent so let start on that and let start at the high level on the macro factor inflation in general be come down across Africa that be the first sign in many country reach double digit figure so let start look at some of that I call it my z e n cluster Zambia from 2004 to 2006 move from the 18 percent in inflation to the nine percent Egypt from the 16 percent to about 8 4 percent Nigeria a similar situation from the 16 percent to the eight percent single digit more fascinating you have other country South Africa Mauritius Namibia all in single digit but that be just part of the story you have a similar trend with currency currency go through a extreme time of stability but that be look at the big picture and the first myth to dispel be that Africa be not a country it be make up applause it be make up of 53 different country so the very definition to say invest in Africa be a no go it be meaningless each country have a unique value proposition you can make money you can lose money in Africa but opportunity boy oh boy they exist and this be what today be about it be about discuss that very opportunity so let start get into the country and into the specific material and datum I be recently elect as Emeka mention as the President of the south African Chamber of Commerce in America and I be very proud and happy to be in that role because it be a fascinating position to be in to hear this dialogue that be just increase in tenor and velocity of decision about trade and company want to come so the first port of call let talk a little bit about South Africa but not the South Africa we always talk about the gold the mineral the First World infrastructure a bit about the other side of it for example South Africa be recently vote as the top destination for the top 1 000 UK company for offshore call center same language timeline et cetera make sense other headline that have recently reach South Africa be Bain Capital and KKR the big boy of private equity Headline in South Africa they have land quite ominous but what be they there for to acquire asset Bing Capital acquisition of Edcon a large retailer be testimony to the confidence they be start to place in the economy because it be actually a long term play be a retailer it be a play on the belief that this middle class that be grow will continue to grow that the boom and the confidence in consumer spending will continue but the story of Africa and my focus be beyond South Africa because there be so much happen undoubtedly Nigeria be clearly a hot spot Challenges and we will hear a lot about Nigeria in this four day but look at Goldman Sachs work we have the famous BRIC Report the new report the Next Eleven highlight that by 2020 Nigeria be go to be amongst the top 10 economy in the world it be a investment opportunity think about that be anyone we bank we investor seriously think about go to Nigeria if you have not why not what be go on in Nigeria A couple of thing I want to talk about it from the perspective of capital market Bellwether sign again Guarantee Trust Bank recently issue the first Euro Bond out of Africa and this exclude South Africa but the first Eurobond the raising of international capital offshore off its own balance sheet without any sovereign backing that be a indication of the confidence that be take place in that economy without any sovereign backing a Nigerian company raise capital offshore it be just a sign of thing to come look at the oil industry Africa provide 18 percent of the U S oil supply with the Middle East just 16 percent it be a important strategic partner let put Nigeria in perspective 2 2 to 2 4 million barrel of oil a day the same league as Kuwait the same league as Venezuela but with Africa let start be careful about this and Emeka and I have have this discussion we have to move away from what be call the curse of the commodity because it be not about oil it be not about commodity for Africa to truly be sustainable we have to move beyond to other industry so let unpack that very quickly and I be go to move through this very very very fast because I can see that clock count down what else be go on there Egypt Egypt be launch a first large industrial zone 2 8 billion investment the announcement just come out the last few week close to the Mediterranean near Alexandria textile petrochemical it be be manage by a Singaporean base management company so they want to emerge as a industrial powerhouse across the industry away from oil let look at agriculture let look at forestry what be go on there in Tanzania last week we have the launch of the East African Organic produce Standard again gather together farmer gather together stakehold in East Africa to get standard for organic produce good price it tie in with small scale farmer in term of no pesticide no fertilizer again opportunity to tackle market to get that high price Uganda the New Forest Company replanting and redevelop they forest why be that important as the energy need be meet and electricity be need we will need pole for roll out electricity but here be the sweetener in the deal they be go to be tap into carbon credit let go back to Nigeria the banking sector have undergo tremendous transformation from over 80 bank to 25 bank strengthen of the system but what be go on there only 10 percent of the country be bank the large population in Africa be in Nigeria 135 million plus person think about that there be only 700 atm in the country opportunity the same for telecom across the country now let look at the continent as a whole person look at the road for example and they would say Angola 90 percent of road be untarred ah problem it be more expensive to transport goods price of goods go up inflation be affect Nigeria 70 percent of road be untarred Zambia 80 percent in general more than 50 percent of road be untarred this be a opportunity energy need it be a opportunity so what be the sign that thing be fundamentally change let look at the stock market in Africa if I have to ask you in 2005 what be the good perform stock market or stock exchange in the world would Egypt come to mind in 2005 the Egyptian stock exchange return over 145 percent what be go on in some of the other country let look at some 2006 number Kenya over 60 percent Nigeria over 40 percent South Africa in the 20 percent high one this be the trend that be take place but in any investment decision the key question be what be my alternative investment because in Africa today we be compete globally for capital and global capital be agnostic it have no loyalty there be a overhang of capital in the U S and the key be yield pickup what Africa be provide be a diversification play and also opportunity for yield pickup for the investor that be aware of what he or she be do now when look at Africa vis a vis other thing and country in Africa vis a vis other thing comparison become important 10 year ago there be very few country that receive sovereign rating from the Standard Poors Moody and Fitch today 16 African country and grow have sovereign country rate what do this mean take Nigeria again double b minus in the league of Ukraine and Turkey immediately we have a comparison the backbone of make investment decision for global holder of capital some other figure South Africa triple b plus Botswana A plus Bakino Faso B minus and so on in fact one of the big agency be set up a office in Africa why be they do that because they expect investment to follow so one of the big bellwether and one of my final point I want to mention be the interesting thing I read be that CNBC have launch they first African channel why be CNBC do this it be the 24 hour rolling African news channel they be do it because they be expect thing to happen I and you the investment we be go to be make the investment the world be go to be make that be the 24 hour news channel dedicate to Africa so that be the change that be come down the pipeline so in conclusion I want to turn back to that very slide that make such a deep impact on I all that year ago this time I will give you the entire picture that I see in 2002 and ask you that when you think about what you role can be in Africa think about you journey in term of bring light to this continent because there be amazing opportunity available and think about the concept of transformation in the back of you mind because thing can be turn around rather quickly in 1899 Joseph Conrad release the heart of darkness a tale of grim horror along the Congo River if one look carefully on the Congo River be one of that bright light and that be the very Congo river generate light the old heart of darkness now generate light with hydro electric power that be a transformation in power of idea so the next step over the next four day be we explore more of this idea and perchance if you can always keep this picture in you mind that when we convene maybe in the distant future in 2020 that picture will look very different thank you applause
