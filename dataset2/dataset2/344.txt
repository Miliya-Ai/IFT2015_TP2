hard work but if you have child you know it do not often work that way no we learn something else the first thing I learn that day be that I never ever want to work that hard again laughter and pretty much never do but I also learn that some person in this world do have to work that hard every day and that be a eye opener and I also learn that a great song can make hard work go a little easy and it also can bring the group together in a way that nothing else can now I be just a little eight year old boy that day when my mama put I out of the car in that hot Texas cotton field I be not even aware of music not even aware of it but that day in the cotton field out there pick when that person start sing I realize I be in the very heart of real music and that be where I have want to be ever since

I have a radio show on public radio Riverwalk I do not care about that I do not care about award or money or anything nothing nothing on the list it would be stuff like see the daffodil bloom in the spring the smell of new mow hay catch a wave and bodysurf the touch of a baby hand the sound of Doc Watson play the guitar listen to old record of Muddy Waters and Uncle Dave Macon and for I the sound of a steel guitar because one of my parent neighbor just give I one of this thing and I would sit around with it and I do not know how to play it but I would just play stuff as sad as I could play and it be the only instrument that of all the one that I play that would really make that connection this be a song that come out of that music well I hear you be have trouble Lord I hate to hear that
