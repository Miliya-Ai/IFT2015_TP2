three year ago I get a phone call base on a early film I have make with a offer to embed the New Hampshire National Guard my idea and literally I wake up in the middle of the night and we have all have that moment you know you go to sleep I be excited with this phone call I be think I just finish make another film about World War II vet and I realize I would get to know they story and I realize this be a once in a lifetime opportunity to tell a warrior story as it unfold so I go to bed that night pretty excited not sure of all the detail but excited it be not at four in the morning but it be close to midnight wake straight up wide awake as could be and I have this idea what if I could in effect virtually embed and create a permeable relationship with the soldier to tell the story from the inside out versus the outside in so I call back major Heilshorn who be the public affair officer of the New Hampshire National Guard and he know I so I be like Greg he be like yes Deborah tell he my idea and you know he be one of the brave man in the world as be General Blair who in the end give I permission to try this experiment within 10 day I be down at Fort Dix He give I my pick of unit I pick one unit Charlie Company Third of the 172nd they be mountain infantry for two reason One they be infantry number two they be go to be base at LSA Anaconda so I know they would have internet access the caveat for my access be I have to get the soldier to volunteer this be a big thing that I think when major h tell I I be not really totally gather what that would mean so what that mean be when I go down to Fort Dix I have to hop out in front of 180 guy and tell they of my vision you can imagine the hailstorm of question I get the opening one be what the fuck do you know about the National Guard I start with the 1607 Massachusetts Bay colony Pequot Indian Wars give they about a nine minute response and there we go so I would like to show the clip of the film it be we trailer because I know obviously you guy be busy many of you may not have have a chance to see it so I want to show the trailer and then I be go to take apart one scene in detail if we could roll Video

Soldiers Sergeant Smith be down Sergeant Smith be down there they be right there Fire fire JB it will be a good country in 20 year cause we be there I hope applause Deborah Scranton thank you one of the thing I would like to talk to you about be have a conversation about something that be difficult to talk about and I would like to relate a experience I have here at TED I do not know how many of you might imagine it but there be actually a tedster who recently get back from Iraq Paul come on stand up this be Paul Anthony he serve applause with the Marines and I want to tell you a little brief story we be one of the lucky one to get in the class with the Sony camera and the Vista software right and we start talk person will see my tag and they will see the War Tapes and then we will start talk about war we get in a conversation with some other person in the class and it go on and on I mean we be there for a hour talk and it really highlight something that I would like to ask you guy to think about and hopefully to help with which be I think a lot of we be very afraid to have conversation about war and about politics and really because maybe we be go to disagree maybe it be go to get uncomfortable how do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation and you know Paul be talk and he then turn to Constance and say you know I would not have this conversation if she be not here because I know she have my back and I want to say I be nervous because I be use to do q as I really related to what James be say yesterday because I be behind the camera you know I can answer question about my movie but for I to come up and talk for 18 minute be a really long time so I want to say Paul I be happy you be here because I know you have my back this film be not about the internet but it could not have be make without it the guy tape on average take two week to get from Iraq to I in the meantime the soldier we would email and IM I do not save all of they because I do not realize at the beginning that it would be something that I would want to keep track of but there be 3 211 email and im and text message that I be able to save the reason I quantify that be because we really embark on this as a mutual journey to really get inside of it so I want to show you a clip and then I be go tell you a little bit of how it get put together if we could roll the clip video sp today be sport unclear radio unclear Christian soldier sp we like to give this insurgent a fair chance so what we do we ride with the window down because you know we obviously have the advantage I be just kid we do not fucking ride with the goddam window down it be not true very unsafe whoa Soldier right there sp all right let get over to that site be advise we be leave Taji right now we believe that the blast be right outside the gate of Taji we be head to that location now Soldier that be a fucking car bomb soldier Motherfuckers Soldiers get you vest on hey get over the fucking yeah yeah any one four element get to the gate sp sheriff one six or any one four element we need you at the gate of Taji right now over Soldier I will walk you through it Voices SP stay low head over to the right get you bag get you bag Screams SP it be mass casualty probably 20 dead at least 20 or 30 wounded Iraqi SP it just look like you know someone have throw a quarter through a guy and it be just like there be no blood come from the shrapnel wound everything be cauterize and it be just like there be a void go through the body this be the scene north they just remove a burn body or half a body from here I do not think there be anything leave from he abdominal down this be blood and you know you walk and you hear the piece of skin and that be it that be all that be leave I remember give three iv bandage several wounded soldier sit in the corner of a sandbag wall shake and scream medic who be terrified and could not perform I later hear that Iraqi casualty be not to be treat in Taji they can work on the post for penny but can not die there they have get to die outside if one of that incompetent medical officer tell I to stop treatment I would have slit he throat right there 21 00 hour and it be just we squad go through today event in we head whether we want to or not News Anchor more violence in Iraq Twin suicide car bombing kill eight Iraqi and wound dozen more near a coalition base north of Baghdad SP we make the news I feel exploit and proud at the same time I have lose all faith in the media a hapless joke I would much rather laugh at than become a part of I should really thank God for save my lucky ass I will do that then I be go to jerk off because this page smell like Linds and there will not be any time for jerk off tomorrow another mission at 06 00 DS now applause thanks when I say early to try and tell a story from the inside out versus the outside in part of what Chris say so eloquently in he introduction be this meld it be a new way of try to make a documentary when I meet the guy and 10 of they agree to take camera in total 21 end up film five soldier film the entire time there be three feature in the film the way I learn about Taji be Steve Pink send I a email and in it attach a photo of that burn body out at the car and the tone from the email be you know it have be a very bad day obviously and I see in my IM window that Mike Moriarty be at the base so I ping Mike and I say Mike can you please go get that interview with Pink because the thing that very often be miss be in the military what they call hot wash it be that immediate interview after something immediately happen you know and if you let time go by it kind of soften and smooth the edge and for I I really want that so in order to get the intimacy to share that experience with you the guy the two most popular mount there be a camera on the turret the gun turret and then on the dashboard of the Humvee Most of the Humvees we end up mount two camera in they so you get to experience that in real time right the interview that you see be the one that Mike go and do within 24 hour of that episode happen Steve Pink read he journal happen five month after he come home I know about that journal but it be very very private and you know you earn someone trust especially in doc filmmaking through you relationship so it be not until five month after he be home that he would read that journal now the news footage I put in there to try to show you know I think mainstream media try to do the good they can in the format that they have but the thing that I know you all have hear a lot of time American soldier say why do not they talk about the good stuff that we do ok this be a perfect example Pink squad and another squad spend they entire day outside the wire they do not have to go outside the wire there be not American hurt out there they spend they entire day outside the wire try to save Iraqi life the Iraqi who work on the post so when you may hear soldier complain that what they be talk about you know and I think it be such a amazing gift that they would share this as a way of bridge and when I talk about that polarity I get at so many different q as and person be really opinionated but it seem like person do not want to hear so much or listen or try to have a exchange and I be as fiery as the next person but I really think you know different speaker have talk about they concern for the world and my concern be that we have to have this conversation and we have to be able to go into scary place where we may you know we think we know but we just have to leave that little bit of openness to know there be such a disconnect and for I it be try to bridge that disconnect I will share one story I get I be often ask you know for I what have be some of the special moment from have work on this film and at screening inevitably you know as I be sure all of you obviously do speak stuff usually you have person who hang around and want to ask you more question and usually the first question be oh what kind of camera do you use or you know this thing but there be always a few guy almost always who be the last one and I have learn over time that that be always the soldier and they wait until pretty much everybody go and for I one of the most profound story someone share with I that then become my story be for that of you who have not see the film and it be not a spoiler it be very common there be a lot of civilian accident where person get in front of Humvees and they get kill in this film there be a scene where a Iraqi woman be kill a soldier come up to I and stand you know really pretty close a foot away from I he be a big guy and he look at I and I smile and then I see the tear start well up in he eye and he be not go to blink and he say my gunner be throw candy and I know what he be go to say the gunner be throw candy they use to throw candy to the kid kid get too close very often and he say I kill a child and I be a father I have child I have not be able to tell my wife I be afraid she be go to think I be a monster I hug he of course and I say you know it be go to be ok and he say I be go to bring she to see you film and then I be go to tell she so when I talk about a disconnect it be not only for maybe that person who do not know a soldier which there obviously be you know this day it be not like World War II where there be a war front and a home front and everybody seem involved you can go for day here and not feel like there be a war go on and often I will hear person say who maybe know that I do this film and they say oh you know I be against the war but I support the soldier and I have start to ask they well that be nice what be you do be you volunteering at a VA you go and see anybody do you if you find out you neighbor be do you spend some time not necessarily ask question but see if they want to talk do you give money to any of the charity you know obviously like Dean Kamen work on that amazing thing but there be charity where you can sponsor computer for wounded soldier I think I challenge we to say to operationalize that term when we say we support someone you know be you a friend to they do you really care and I would just say it be my hope and I would ask you guy to please you know reach out a hand and really do give they a hug thank you
