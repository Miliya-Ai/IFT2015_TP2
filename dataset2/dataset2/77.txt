I be ask to come here and speak about creation and I only have 15 minute and I see they be count already and I can in 15 minute I think I can touch only a very rather janitorial branch of creation which I call creativity Creativity be how we cope with creation while creation sometimes seem a bit un graspable or even pointless creativity be always meaningful see for instance in this picture you know creation be what put that dog in that picture and creativity be what make we see a chicken on he hindquarter when you think about you know creativity have a lot to do with causality too you know when I be a teenager I be a creator I just do thing then I become a adult and start know who I be and try to maintain that persona I become creative it be not until I actually do a book and a retrospective exhibition that I could track exactly look like all the crazy thing that I have do all my drinking all my party they follow a straight line that bring I to the point that actually I be talk to you at this moment though it be actually true you know the reason I be talk to you right now be because I be bear in Brazil if I be bear in Monterey probably would be in Brazil you know I be bear in Brazil and grow up in the 70 under a climate of political distress and I be force to learn to communicate in a very specific way in a sort of a semiotic black market you could not really say what you want to say you have to invent way of do it you do not trust information very much that lead I to another step of why I be here today be because I really like media of all kind I be a media junkie and eventually get involve with advertising my first job in Brazil be actually to develop a way to improve the readability of billboard and base on speed angle of approach and actually block of text it be very actually it be a very good study and get I a job in a ad agency and they also decide that I have to to give I a very ugly plexiglas trophy for it and another point why I be here be that the day I go to pick up the plexiglas trophy I rent a tuxedo for the first time in my life pick the thing do not have any friend on my way out I have to break a fight apart somebody be hit somebody else with brass knuckle they be in tuxedo and fight it be very ugly and also advertise person do that all the time laughter and I well what happen be when I go back it be on the way back to my car the guy who get hit decide to grab a gun I do not know why he have a gun and shoot the first person he decide to be he aggressor the first person be wear a black tie a tuxedo it be I luckily it be not fatal as you can all see and even more luckily the guy say that he be sorry and I bribe he for compensation money otherwise I press charge and that be how with this money I pay for a ticket to come to the United States in 1983 and that be very the basic reason I be talk to you here today because I get shoot laughter applause well when I start work with my own work I decide that I should not do image you know I become I take this very iconoclastic approach because when I decide to go into advertising I want to do I want to airbrush naked person on ice for whiskey commercial that be what I really want to do laughter but I they do not let I do it so I just you know they would only let I do other thing but I be not into sell whiskey I be into sell ice the first work be actually object it be kind of a mixture of find object product design and advertising and I call they relic they be display first at Stux Gallery in 1983 this be the clown skull be a remnant of a race of a very evolve race of entertainer they live in Brazil long time ago laughter this be the Ashanti joystick unfortunately it have become obsolete because it be design for Atari platform a Playstation II be in the work maybe for the next TED I will bring it the rock podium laughter this be the pre columbian coffeemaker laughter actually the idea come out of a argument that I have at Starbucks that I insist that I be not have Colombian coffee the coffee be actually pre columbian the Bonsai table the entire Encyclopedia Britannica bind in a single volume for travel purpose and the half tombstone for person who be not dead yet I want to take that into the realm of image and I decide to make thing that have the same identity conflict so I decide to do work with cloud because cloud can mean anything you want but now I want to work in a very low tech way so something that would mean at the same time a lump of cotton a cloud and Durer pray hand although this look a lot more like Mickey Mouse pray hand but I be still you know this be a kitty cloud they be call equivalent after Alfred Stieglitz work the snail but I be still work with sculpture and I be really try to go flat and flat the Teapot I have a chance to go to Florence in I think it be 94 and I see Ghiberti Door of Paradise and he do something that be very tricky he put together two different media from different period of time first he get a age old way of make it which be relief and he work this with three point perspective which be brand new technology at the time and it be totally overkill and you eye do not know which level to read and you become trap into this kind of representation so I decide to make this very simple rendering that at first they be take as a line draw you know something that be very and then I do it with wire the idea be to because everybody overlook white like pencil drawing you know and they would look at it ah it be a pencil draw then you have this double take and see that it be actually something that exist in time it have a physicality and you start go deep and deep into sort of narrative that go this way towards the image so this be Monkey with Leica Relaxation Fiat lux and the same way the history of representation evolve from line drawing to shade drawing and I want to deal with other subject I start take that into the realm of landscape which be something that be almost a picture of nothing I make this picture call picture of thread and I name they after the amount of yard that I use to represent each picture this always end up be a photograph at the end or more like a etching in this case so this be a lighthouse this be 6 500 Yards after Corot 9 000 Yards after Gerhard Richter and I do not know how many yard after John Constable depart from the line I decide to tackle the idea of point like which be more similar to the type of representation that we find in photograph themselves I have meet a group of child in the caribbean island of Saint Kitts and I do work and play with they I get some photograph from they upon my arrival in New York I decide they be child of sugar plantation worker and by manipulate sugar over a black paper I make portrait of they this be applause thank you this be Valentina the fast it be just the name of the child with the little thing you get to know of somebody that you meet very briefly Valicia Jacynthe but another layer of representation be still introduce because I be do this while I be make this picture I realize that I could add still another thing I be try to make a subject something that would interfere with the theme so chocolate be very good because it have it bring to mind idea that go from scatology to romance and so I decide to make this picture and they be very large so you have to walk away from it to be able to see they so they be call picture of Chocolate Freud probably could explain chocolate good than I he be the first subject and Jackson Pollock also Pictures of crowd be particularly interesting because you know you go to that you try to figure out the threshold with something you can define very easily like a face go into become just a texture paparazzi I use the dust at the Whitney Museum to render some piece of they collection and I pick minimalist piece because they be about specificity and you render this with the most non specific material which be dust itself like you know you have the skin particle of every single museum visitor they do a dna scan of this they will come up with a great mailing list this be Richard Serra I buy a computer and they tell I it have million of color in it you know a artist first response to this be who count it you know and I realize that I never work with color because I have a hard time control the idea of single color but once they be apply to numeric structure then you can feel more comfortable so the first time I work with color be by make this Mosaic of pantone swatch they end up be very large picture and I photograph with a very large camera a 8x10 camera so you can see the surface of every single swatch like in this picture of Chuck Close and you have to walk very far to be able to see it also the reference to Gerhard Richter use of color chart and the idea also enter another realm of representation that be very common to we today which be the bit map I end up narrow the subject to Monet Haystacks this be something I use to do as a joke you know make the same like Robert Smithson spiral jetty and then leave trace as if it be do on a tabletop I try to prove that he do not do that thing in the Salt Lake but then just do the model I be try to explore the relationship between the model and the original and I feel that I would have to actually go there and make some earthwork myself I opt for very simple line drawing kind of stupid look and at the same time I be do this very large construction be 150 meter away now I would do very small one which would be like but under the same light and I would show they together so the viewer would have to really figure it out what one he be look I be not interested in the very large thing or in the small thing I be more interested in the thing in between you know because you can leave a enormous range for ambiguity there this be like you see the size of a person over there this be a pipe a hanger and this be another thing that I do you know work everybody love to watch somebody draw but not many person have a chance to watch somebody draw in a lot of person at the same time to evidence a single drawing and I love this work because I do this cartoonish cloud over Manhattan for a period of two month and it be quite wonderful because I have a interest a early interest in theater that be justify on this thing in theater you have the character and the actor in the same place try to negotiate each other in front of a audience and in this you would have like a something that look like a cloud and it be a cloud at the same time so they be like perfect actor my interest in act especially bad act go a long way actually I once pay like 60 dollar to see a very great actor to do a version of King Lear and I feel really rob because by the time the actor start be King Lear he stop be the great actor that I have pay money to see on the other hand you know I pay like three dollar I think and I go to a warehouse in Queens to see a version of Othello by a amateur group and it be quite fascinating because you know the guy he name be Joey Grimaldi he impersonate the Moorish general you know for the first three minute he be really that general and then he go back into plumber he work as a plumber so plumber general plumber general so for three dollar I see two tragedy for the price of one see I think it be not really about impression make person fall for a really perfect illusion as much as it be to make I usually work at the low threshold of visual illusion because it be not about fool somebody it be actually give somebody a measure of they own belief how much you want to be fool that be why we pay to go to magic show and thing like that well I think that be it my time be nearly up thank you very much
