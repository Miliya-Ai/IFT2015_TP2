good morning lady and gentleman my name be Art Benjamin and I be a mathemagician what that mean be I combine my love of math and magic to do something I call mathemagic but before I get start I have a quick question for the audience by any chance do anyone happen to bring with they this morning a calculator seriously if you have a calculator with you raise you hand raise you hand do you hand go up now bring it out bring it out anybody else I see I see one way in the back you sir that be three and anybody on this side here ok over there on the aisle would the four of you please bring out you

calculator just in case ok great what I be go to try and do then I notice it take some of you a little bit of time to get you answer that be ok I will give you a shortcut for multiply even fast on the calculator there be something call the square of a number which most of you know be take a number and multiply it by itself for instance five square would be audience 25 AB 25 the way we can square on most calculator let I demonstrate with this one be by take the number such as five hit time and then equal and on most calculator that will give you the square on some of this ancient rpn calculator you have get a x square button on it will allow you to do the calculation even fast what I be go to try and do now be to square in my head four two digit number fast than they can do on they calculator even use the shortcut method what I will use be the second row this time and I will get four of you to each yell out a two digit number and if you would square the first number and if you would square the second the third and the fourth I will try and race you to the answer ok so quickly a two digit number please audience 37 Arthur Benjamin 37 square ok audience 23 AB 23 square ok audience 59 AB 59 square ok and finally audience 93 AB 93 square would you call out you answer please Volunteer 1369 AB 1369 Volunteer 529 AB 529 Volunteer 3481 AB 3481 Volunteer 8649 AB thank you very much applause let I try to take this one step far I be go to try to square some three digit number this time I will not even write this down I will just call they out as they be call out to I anyone I point to call out a three digit number anyone on we panel verify the answer just give some indication if it be right a three digit number sir yes audience 987 AB 987 square be 974 169

time on this I will not beat you to the answer on this one but I will try to get the answer right to make this a little bit more random let take the fourth row this time let say one two three four if each of you would call out a single digit between zero and nine that will be the four digit number that I will square nine seven five eight 9 758 this will take I a little bit of time so bear with I 95 million sigh 218 564 Volunteer Yes AB thank you very much applause applause end now I would attempt to square a five digit number and I can but unfortunately most calculator can not laughter eight digit capacity do not you hate that so since we have reach the limit of we calculator what be that do yours go high Volunteer I do not know AB oh yours do Volunteer I can probably do it AB I will talk to you later in the meanwhile let I conclude the first part of my show by do something a little tricky let take the large number on the board here 8649 would you each enter that on you calculator and instead of square it this time I want you to take that number and multiply it by any three digit number that you want but do not tell I what you be multiply by just multiply it by any random three digit number so you should have as a answer either a six digit or probably a seven digit number how many digit do you have six or seven seven and yours seven seven and uncertain seven be there any possible way that I could know what seven digit number you have say no laughter good then I shall attempt the impossible or at least the improbable what I have like each of you to do be to call out for I any six of you seven digit any six of they in any order you would like laughter one digit at a time I shall try and determine the digit you have leave out start with you seven digit number call out any six of they please Volunteer 1 9 7 0 4 2 AB do you leave out the number 6 good ok that be one you have a seven digit number call out any six of they please Volunteer 4 4 8 7 5 I think I only hear five number I wait 44875 do you leave out the number 6 same as she do ok you have get a seven digit number call out any six of they loud and clear Volunteer 0 7 9 0 4 4 I think you leave out the number 3 AB that be three the odds of I get all four of this right by random guess would be one in 10 000 10 to the fourth power ok any six of they laughter really scramble they up this time please Volunteer 2 6 3 9 7 2 do you leave out the number 7 and let give all four of this person a nice round of applause thank you very much applause applause end for my next number laughter while I mentally

I AB what year would you like CA 1824 AB 1824 ok AB and what month CA June AB June what CA Sixth AB be that a Sunday CA it be AB and it be cloudy laughter good thank you very much applause applause end but I would like to wrap thing up now by allude to something from early in the presentation there be a gentleman up here who have a 10 digit calculator where be he would you stand up 10 digit guy ok stand up for I just for a second so I can see where you be you have a 10 digit calculator sir as well ok what I be go to try and do be to square in my head a five digit number require a 10 digit calculator but to make my job more interesting for you as well as for I I be go to do this problem think out loud so you can actually honestly hear what be go on in my mind while I do a calculation of this size now I have to apologize to we magician friend Lennart Green I know as a magician we be not suppose to reveal we secret but I be not too afraid that person be go to start do my show next week so I think we be ok laughter applause so let see let take a different row of person start with you I will get five digit one two three four oh I do this row already let do the row before you start with you one two three four five call out a single digit that will be the five digit number that I will try to square go ahead five seven six eight three 57 683 square Yuck let I explain to you how I be go to attempt this problem I be go to break the problem down into three part I will do 57 000 square plus 683 square plus 57 000 time 683 time two add all that number together and with any luck arrive at the answer now let I recap laughter thank you laughter while I explain something else laughter I know that you can use right laughter while I do this calculation you might hear certain word as oppose to number creep into the calculation let I explain what that be this be a phonetic code a mnemonic device that I use that allow I to convert number into word I store they as word and later on retrieve they as number I know it sound complicated it be not I do not want you to think you be see something out of rain man laughter there be definitely a method to my madness definitely definitely sorry laughter if you want to talk to I about adhd afterwards you can talk to I then by the way one last instruction for my judge with the calculator you know who you be there be at least a 50 percent chance that I will make a mistake here if I do do not tell I what the mistake be just say you be close or something like that and I will try and figure out the answer which could be pretty entertaining in itself if however I be right whatever you do do not keep it to yourself ok laughter make sure everybody know that I get the answer right because this be my big finish ok so without any more stall here we go I will start the problem in the middle with 57 time 683 57 time 68 be 3 400 plus 476 be 3876 that be 38 760 plus 171 38 760 plus 171 be 38 931 38 931 double that to get 77 862 77 862 become cookie fission cookie fission be 77 822 that seem right I will go on Cookie fission ok next I do 57 square which be 3 249 so I can say three billion take the 249 add that to cookie 249 oops but I see a carry come 249 add that to cookie 250 plus 77 be 327 million fission fission ok finally we do 683 square that be 700 time 666 plus 17 square be 466 489 rev up if I need it rev up take the 466 add that to fission to get oh gee 328 489 audience yeah AB Good thank you very much applause I hope you enjoy mathemagic thank you applause
