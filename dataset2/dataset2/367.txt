you know I be so bad at tech that my daughter who be now 41 when she be five be overhear by I to say to a friend of hers if it do not bleed when you cut it my daddy do not understand it laughter so the assignment I have be give may be a insuperable obstacle for I but I be certainly go to try what have I hear during this last four day this be my third visit to TED one be to tedm and one as you have hear be a regular TED two year ago I have hear what I consider a extraordinary thing that I have only hear a little bit in the two previous ted and what that be be a interweaving and a interlard a intermixing of a sense of social responsibility in so many of the talk global responsibility in fact appeal to enlightened self interest but it go far beyond enlightened self interest one of the most impressive thing about what some perhaps 10 of the speaker have be talk about be the realization as you listen to they carefully that they be not say well this be what we should do this be what I would like you to do it be this be what I have do because I be excited by it because it be a wonderful thing and it be do something for I and of course it be accomplish a great deal it be the old concept the real Greek concept of philanthropy in its original sense phil anthropy the love of humankind and the only explanation I can have for some of what you have be hear in the last four day be that it arise in fact out of a form of love and this give I enormous hope and hope of course be the topic that I be suppose to be speak about which I have completely forget about until I arrive and when I do I think well I would better look this word up in the dictionary so Sarah and I my wife walk over to the public library which be four block away on Pacific Street and we get the oed and we look in there and there be 14 definition of hope none of which really hit you between the eye as be the appropriate one and of course that make sense because hope be a abstract phenomenon it be a abstract idea it be not a concrete word well it remind I a little bit of surgery if there be one operation for a disease you know it work if there be 15 operation you know that none of they work and that be the way it be with definition of word if you have appendicitis they take you appendix out and you be cure if you have get reflux oesophagitis there be 15 procedure and Joe Schmo do it one way and will blow do it another way and none of they work and that be the way it be with this word hope they all come down to the idea of a expectation of something good that be due to happen and you know what I find out the Indo European root of the word hope be a stem k e u we would spell it k e u it be pronounced koy and it be the same root from which the word curve come from but what it mean in the original Indo European be a change in direction go in a different way and I find that very interesting and very provocative because what you have be hear in the last couple of day be the sense of go in different direction direction that be specific and unique to problem there be different paradigm you have hear that word several time in the last four day and everyone familiar with kuhnian paradigm so when we think of hope now we have to think of look in other direction than we have be look there be another not definition but description of hope that have always appeal to I and it be one by v clav Havel in he perfectly spectacular book break the peace in which he say that hope do not consist of the expectation that thing will come out exactly right but the expectation that they will make sense regardless of how they come out I can not tell you how reassured I be by the very last sentence in that glorious presentation by Dean Kamen a few day ago I be not sure I hear it right so I find he in one of the inter session he be talk to a very large man but I do not care I interrupt and I say do you say this he say I think so so here be what it be I will repeat it the world will not be save by the internet it be wonderful do you know what the world will be save by I will tell you it will be save by the human spirit and by the human spirit I do not mean anything divine I do not mean anything supernatural certainly not come from this skeptic what I mean be this ability that each of we have to be something great than herself or himself to arise out of we ordinary self and achieve something that at the beginning we think perhaps we be not capable of on a elemental level we have all feel that spirituality at the time of childbirth some of you have feel it in laboratory some of you have feel it at the workbench we feel it at concert I have feel it in the operating room at the bedside it be a elevation of we beyond ourselves and I think that it be go to be in time the element of the human spirit that we have be hear about bit by bit by bit from so many of the speaker in the last few day and if there be anything that have permeate this room it be precisely that I be intrigue by a concept that be bring to life in the early part of the 19th century actually in the second decade of the 19th century by a 27 year old poet whose name be Percy Shelley now we all think that Shelley obviously be the great romantic poet that he be many of we tend to forget that he write some perfectly wonderful essay too and the most well remembered essay be one call a defence of Poetry now it be about five six seven eight page long and it get kind of deep and difficult after about the third page but somewhere on the second page he begin talk about the notion that he call moral imagination and here be what he say roughly translate a man generic man a man to be greatly good must imagine clearly he must see himself and the world through the eye of another and of many other see himself and the world not just the world but see himself what be it that be expect of we by the billion of person who live in what Laurie Garrett the other day so appropriately call despair and disparity what be it that they have every right to ask of we what be it that we have every right to ask of ourselves out of we share humanity and out of the human spirit well you know precisely what it be there be a great deal of argument about whether we as the great nation that we be should be the policeman of the world the world constabulary but there should be virtually no argument about whether we should be the world healer there have certainly be no argument about that in this room in the past four day so if we be to be the world healer every disadvantaged person in this world include in the United States become we patient every disadvantaged nation and perhaps we own nation become we patient so it be fun to think about the etymology of the word patient it come initially from the latin patior to endure or to suffer so you go back to the old Indo European root again and what do you find the Indo European stem be pronounced payen we would spell it p a e n and lo and behold mirabile dictu it be the same root as the word compassion come from p a e n so the lesson be very clear the lesson be that we patient the world and the disadvantaged of the world that patient deserve we compassion but beyond we compassion and far great than compassion be we moral imagination and we identification with each individual who live in that world not to think of they as a huge forest but as individual tree of course in this day and age the trick be not to let each tree be obscure by that Bush in Washington that can get can get in the way laughter so here we be we be should be morally commit to be the healer of the world and we have have example over and over and over again you have just hear one in the last 15 minute of person who have not only have that commitment but have the charisma the brilliance and I think in this room it be easy to use the word brilliant my God the brilliance to succeed at least at the beginning of they quest and who no doubt will continue to succeed as long as more and more of we enlist ourselves in they cause now if we be talk about medicine and we be talk about healing I would like to quote someone who have not be quote it seem to I everybody in the world be quote here Pogo be quote Shakespeare be quote backwards forwards inside out I would like to quote one of my own household god I suspect he never really say this because we do not know what hippocrate really say but we do know for sure that one of the great Greek physician say the follow and it have be record in one of the book attribute to Hippocrates and the book be call Precepts and I will read you what it be remember I have be talk about essentially philanthropy the love of humankind the individual humankind and the individual humankind that can bring that kind of love translate into action translate in some case into enlightened self interest and here he be 2 400 year ago where there be love of humankind there be love of healing we have see that here today with the sense with the sensitivity and in the last three day and with the power of the indomitable human spirit thank you very much applause
