I be very very happy to be amidst some of the most the light be really disturb my eye and they be reflect on my glass I be very happy and honor to be amidst very very innovative and intelligent person I have listen to the three previous speaker and guess what happen every single thing I plan to say they have say it here and it look and sound like I have nothing else to say laughter but there be a say in my culture that if a bud leave a tree without say something that bud be a young one so I will since I be not young and be very old I still will say something we be host this conference at a very opportune moment because another conference be take place in Berlin it be the g8 Summit the G8 Summit propose that the solution to Africa problem should be a massive increase in aid something akin to the Marshall Plan unfortunately I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan one because the benefit of the Marshall Plan have be overstate its large recipient be Germany and France and it be only 2 5 percent of they gdp a average African country receive foreign aid to the tune of 13 15 percent of its gdp and that be a unprecedented transfer of financial resource from rich country to poor country but I want to say that there be two thing we need to connect how the media cover Africa in the West and the consequence of that by display despair helplessness and hopelessness the media be tell the truth about Africa and nothing but the truth however the media be not tell we the whole truth because despair civil war hunger and famine although they be part and parcel of we African reality they be not the only reality and secondly they be the small reality Africa have 53 nation we have civil war only in six country which mean that the media be cover only six country Africa have immense opportunity that never navigate through the web of despair and helplessness that the western media largely present to its audience but the effect of that presentation be it appeal to sympathy it appeal to pity it appeal to something call charity and as a consequence the western view of Africa economic dilemma be frame wrongly the wrong framing be a product of think that Africa be a place of despair what should we do with it we should give food to the hungry we should deliver medicine to that who be ill we should send peacekeeping troops to serve that who be face a civil war and in the process Africa have be strip of self initiative I want to say that it be important to recognize that Africa have fundamental weakness but equally it have opportunity and a lot of potential we need to reframe the challenge that be face Africa from a challenge of despair which be call poverty reduction to a challenge of hope we frame it as a challenge of hope and that be worth creation the challenge face all that who be interested in Africa be not the challenge of reduce poverty it should be a challenge of create wealth once we change that two thing if you say the African be poor and they need poverty reduction you have the international cartel of good intention move onto the continent with what Medicines for the poor food relief for that who be hungry and peacekeeper for that who be face civil war and in the process none of this thing really be productive because you be treat the symptom not the cause of Africa fundamental problem send somebody to school and give they medicine lady and gentleman do not create wealth for they wealth be a function of income and income come from you find a profitable trading opportunity or a well pay job now once we begin to talk about wealth creation in Africa we second challenge will be who be the wealth create agent in any society they be entrepreneur unclear tell we they be always about four percent of the population but 16 percent be imitator but they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship so where should we be put the money we need to put money where it can productively grow Support private investment in Africa both domestic and foreign support research institution because knowledge be a important part of wealth creation but what be the international aid community do with Africa today they be throw large sum of money for primary health for primary education for food relief the entire continent have be turn into a place of despair in need of charity lady and gentleman can any one of you tell I a neighbor a friend a relative that you know who become rich by receive charity by hold the beg bowl and receive alms do any one of you in the audience have that person do any one of you know a country that develop because of the generosity and kindness of another well since I be not see the hand it appear that what I be state be true Bono Yes Andrew Mwenda I can see Bono say he know the country which country be that Bono it be a Irish land laughter Bono unclear am thank you very much but let I tell you this external actor can only present to you a opportunity the ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into a advantage depend on you internal capacity Africa have receive many opportunity many of they we have not benefit much why because we lack the internal institutional framework and policy framework that can make it possible for we to benefit from we external relation I will give you a example under the Cotonou Agreement formerly know as the Lome Convention African country have be give a opportunity by Europe to export goods duty free to the European Union market my own country Uganda have a quota to export 50 000 metric ton of sugar to the European Union market we have not export one kilogram yet we import 50 000 metric ton of sugar from Brazil and Cuba secondly under the beef protocol of that agreement African country that produce beef have quota to export beef duty free to the European Union market none of that country include Africa most successful nation Botswana have ever meet its quota so I want to argue today that the fundamental source of Africa inability to engage the rest of the world in a more productive relationship be because it have a poor institutional and policy framework and all form of intervention need support the evolution of the kind of institution that create wealth the kind of institution that increase productivity how do we begin to do that and why be aid the bad instrument aid be the bad instrument and do you know why because all government across the world need money to survive money be need for a simple thing like keep law and order you have to pay the army and the police to show law and order and because many of we government be quite dictatorial they need really to have the army clobber the opposition the second thing you need to do be pay you political hanger on why should person support they government well because it give they good pay job or in many African country unofficial opportunity to profit from corruption the fact be no government in the world with the exception of a few like that of Idi Amin can seek to depend entirely on force as a instrument of rule many country in the unclear they need legitimacy to get legitimacy government often need to deliver thing like primary education primary health road build hospital and clinic if the government fiscal survival depend on it have to raise money from its own person such a government be drive by self interest to govern in a more enlightened fashion it will sit with that who create wealth talk to they about the kind of policy and institution that be necessary for they to expand a scale and scope of business so that it can collect more tax revenue from they the problem with the African continent and the problem with the aid industry be that it have distort the structure of incentive face the government in Africa the productive margin in we government search for revenue do not lie in the domestic economy it lie with international donor rather than sit with Ugandan applause rather than sit with Ugandan entrepreneur Ghanaian businessman south African enterprising leader we government find it more productive to talk to the IMF and the World Bank I can tell you even if you have ten ph d you can never beat Bill Gates in understand the computer industry why because the knowledge that be require for you to understand the incentive necessary to expand a business it require that you listen to the person the private sector actor in that industry government in Africa have therefore be give a opportunity by the international community to avoid build productive arrangement with you own citizen and therefore allow to begin endless negotiation with the IMF and the World Bank and then it be the IMF and the World Bank that tell they what its citizen need in the process we the African person have be sideline from the policy make policy orientation and policy implementation process in we country we have limit input because he who pay the piper call the tune the IMF the World Bank and the cartel of good intention in the world have take over we right as citizen and therefore what we government be do because they depend on aid be to listen to international creditor rather than they own citizen but I want to put a caveat on my argument and that caveat be that it be not true that aid be always destructive some aid may have build a hospital feed a hungry village it may have build a road and that road may have serve a very good role the mistake of the international aid industry be to pick this isolate incident of success generalize they pour billion and trillion of dollar into they and then spread they across the whole world ignore the specific and unique circumstance in a give village the skill the practice the norm and habit that allow that small aid project to succeed like in Sauri village in Kenya where Jeffrey Sachs be work and therefore generalize this experience as the experience of everybody aid increase the resource available to government and that make work in a government the most profitable thing you can have as a person in Africa seek a career by increase the political attractiveness of the state especially in we ethnically fragmented society in Africa aid tend to accentuate ethnic tension as every single ethnic group now begin struggle to enter the state in order to get access to the foreign aid pie lady and gentleman the most enterprising person in Africa can not find opportunity to trade and to work in the private sector because the institutional and policy environment be hostile to business government be not change it why because they do not need to talk to they own citizen they talk to international donor so the most enterprising African end up go to work for government and that have increase the political tension in we country precisely because we depend on aid I also want to say that it be important for we to note that over the last 50 year Africa have be receive increase aid from the international community in the form of technical assistance and financial aid and all other form of aid between 1960 and 2003 we continent receive 600 billion dollar of aid and we be still tell that there be a lot of poverty in Africa where have all the aid go I want to use the example of my own country call Uganda and the kind of structure of incentive that aid have bring there in the 2006 2007 budget expect revenue 2 5 trillion shill the expect foreign aid 1 9 trillion Uganda recurrent expenditure by recurrent what do I mean Hand to mouth be 2 6 trillion why do the government of Uganda budget spend 110 percent of its own revenue it be because there be somebody there call foreign aid who contribute for it but this show you that the government of Uganda be not commit to spend its own revenue to invest in productive investment but rather it devote this revenue to pay structure of public expenditure public administration which be largely patronage take 690 billion the military 380 billion agriculture which employ 18 percent of we poverty stricken citizen take only 18 billion Trade and industry take 43 billion and let I show you what do public expenditure rather public administration expenditure in Uganda constitute there you go 70 cabinet minister 114 presidential adviser by the way who never see the president except on television laughter applause and when they see he physically it be at public function like this and even there it be he who advise they laughter we have 81 unit of local government each local government be organize like the central government a bureaucracy a cabinet a parliament and so many job for the political hanger on there be 56 and when we president want to amend the constitution and remove term limit he have to create 25 new district and now there be 81 three hundred thirty three member of parliament you need Wembley Stadium to host we parliament one hundred thirty four commission and semi autonomous government body all of which have director and the car and the final thing this be address to Mr Bono in he work he may help we on this a recent government of Uganda study find that there be 3 000 four wheel drive motor vehicle at the Minister of Health headquarters Uganda have 961 sub county each of they with a dispensary none of which have a ambulance so the four wheel drive vehicle at the headquarters drive the minister the permanent secretary the bureaucrat and the international aid bureaucrat who work in aid project while the poor die without ambulance and medicine finally I want to say that before I come to speak here I be tell that the principle of TEDGlobal be that the good speech should be like a miniskirt it should be short enough to arouse interest but long enough to cover the subject I hope I have achieve that laughter thank you very much applause
