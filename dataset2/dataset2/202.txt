it be a incredible surprise to I to find out that there be actually a organization that care about both part of my life because basically I work as a theoretical physicist I develop and test model of the Big Bang use observational datum and I have be moonlight for the last five year help with a project in Africa and I get a lot of flak for this at Cambridge People wonder you know how do you have time to do this and so on and so it be simply astonishing to I to find a organization that actually appreciate both that side so I think I would start off by just tell you a little bit about myself and why I lead this schizophrenic life well I be bear in South Africa and my parent be imprison for resist the racist regime when they be release we leave and we go as refugee to Kenya and Tanzania both be very young country then and full of hope for the future we have a amazing childhood we do not have any money but we be outdoors most of the time we have fantastic friend and we see the wonder of the world like Kilimanjaro Serengeti and the Olduvai Gorge well then we move to London for high school and after that there be nothing much to say about that it be rather dull but I come back to Africa at the age of 17 as a volunteer teacher to Lesotho which be a tiny country surround at that time by apartheid South Africa Well 80 percent of the man in Lesotho work in the mine over the border in brutal condition nevertheless I as I be sure as a rather irritating young white man come into they village I be welcome with incredible hospitality and warmth but the kid be the good part the kid be amazing extremely eager and often very bright and I be just go to tell you one story which get through to I I use to try to take the kid outside as often as possible to try to connect the academic stuff with the real world and they be not use to that but I take they outside one day and I say I want you to estimate the height of the building and I expect they to put a ruler next to the wall size it up with a finger and make a estimate of the height but there be one little boy very small for he age he be the son of one of the poor family in the village and he be not do that he be scribble with chalk on the pavement and so I say I be annoyed I say what be you do I want you to estimate the height of the building he say ok I measure the height of a brick I count the number of brick and now I be multiply well laughter I have not think of that one and many experience like this happen to I another one be that I meet a miner he be home on he three month leave from the mine sit next to he one day he say there be only one thing that I really love at school and you know what it be Shakespeare and he recite some to I and this and many similar experience convince I that there be just ton of bright kid in Africa inventive kid intellectual kid and starve of opportunity and if Africa be go to get fix it be by they not by we well after applause that be the truth well after Lesotho I travel across Africa before return to England so gray and depressing in comparison and I go to Cambridge and there I fall for theoretical physics well I be not go to explain this equation but theoretical physics be really a amazing subject we can write down all the law of physics we know in one line and admittedly it be in a very shorthand notation and it contain 18 free parameter ok which we have to fit to the datum so it be not the final story but it be a incredibly powerful summary of everything we know about nature at the most basic level and apart from a few very important loose end which you have hear about here like dark energy and dark matter this equation describe seem to describe everything about the universe and what be in it but there be one big puzzle remain and this be most succinctly put to I by my primary school math teacher in Tanzania who be a wonderful Scottish lady who I still stay in touch with and she be now in she 80 and when I try to explain my work to she she wave away all the detail and she say Neil there be only one question that really matter what bang laughter everyone talk about the Big Bang what bang and she be right it be a question we have all be avoid the standard explanation be that the universe somehow spring into existence full of a strange kind of energy inflationary energy which blow it up but the puzzle of why the universe emerge in that peculiar state be completely unsolved now I work on that theory for a while with Stephen Hawking and other but then I begin to explore another alternative the alternative be that the Big Bang be not the beginning perhaps the universe exist before the bang and the bang be just a violent event in a pre exist universe well this possibility be actually suggest by the late theory the unified theory which try to explain all that 18 free parameter in a single framework which will hopefully predict all of they and I will just share a cartoon of this idea here it be all I can convey accord to this theory there be extra dimension of space not just the three we be familiar with but at every point in the room there be more dimension and in particular there be one rather strange one in the most elegant unify theory we have the strange one look like this that we live in a three dimensional world we live in one of this world and I can only show it as a sheet but it be really three dimensional and a tiny distance away there be another sheet also three dimensional and they be separate by a gap the gap be very tiny and I have blow it up so you can see it but it be really a tiny fraction of the size of a atomic nucleus I will not go into the detail of why we think the universe be like this but it come out of the math and try to explain the physics that we know well I get interested in this because it seem to I that it be a obvious question which be what happen if this two three dimensional world should actually collide and if they collide it would look a lot like the Big Bang but it be slightly different than in the conventional picture the conventional picture of the Big Bang be a point everything come out of a point you have infinite density and all the equation break down no hope of describe that in this picture you will notice the bang be extend it be not a point the density of matter be finite and we have a chance of a consistent set of equation that can describe the whole process so to cut a long story short we have explore this alternative we have show that it can fit all of the datum that we have about the formation of galaxy the fluctuation in the microwave background furthermore there be a experimental way to tell this theory apart from the inflationary explanation that I tell you before it involve gravitational wave and in this scenario not only be the Big Bang not the beginning as you can see from the picture it can happen over and over again it may be that we live in a endless universe both in space and in time and there have be bang in the past and there will be bang in the future and maybe we live in a endless universe well make and test model of the universe be for I the good way I have of enjoy and appreciate the universe we need to make the good mathematical model we can the most consistent one and then we scrutinize they logically and with datum and we try to convince ourselves we really try to convince ourselves they be wrong that be progress when we prove thing wrong and gradually we hopefully move close and close to understand the world as I pursue my career something be always gnaw away inside I what about Africa what about that kid I would leave behind instead of develop as we have all hope in the 60 thing have get bad Africa be grip by poverty disease and war this be very graphically show by the Worldmapper website and project and so the idea be to represent each country on a map but scale the area accord to some quantity so here be just the standard area map of the world by the way Africa be very large and the next map now show Africa gdp in 1960 around the time of independence for many African state now this be 1990 and then 2002 and here be a projection for 2015 big change be happen in the world but they be not help Africa what about Africa population the population be not out of proportion to its area but Africa lead the world in death from often preventable cause malnutrition simple infection and birth complication then there be HIV AIDS and then there be death from war ok currently there be 45 000 person a month die in the Congo as a consequence of the war there over coltan and diamond and other thing it be still go on what about Africa capacity to do something about this problem well here be the number of physician in Africa here be the number of person in high education and here most shocking to I the number of scientific research paper come out of Africa it just do not exist scientifically and this be very eloquently argue at TED Africa that all of the aid that be be give have completely fail to put Africa onto its own two foot well the transition to democracy in South Africa in 1994 be literally a dream come true for many of we my parent be both elect to the first parliament alongside Nelson and Winnie Mandela they be the only other couple and in 2001 I take a research leave to visit they and while I be busy work I be work on this collide world in the day but I learn that there be a desperate shortage of skill especially mathematical skill in industry in government in education the ability to make and test model have become essential not only to every single area of science today but also to modern society itself and if you do not have math you be not go to enter the modern age so I have a idea and the idea be very simple the idea be to set up a African Institute for Mathematical Sciences or AIMS and let recruit student from the whole of Africa bring they together with lecturer from all over the world and we will try to give they a fantastic education well as a Cambridge professor I have many contact and to my astonishment they back I 100 percent they say go and do it and we will come and lecture and I know it would be amazing fun to bring brilliant student from this country where they do not have any opportunity together with the good lecturer in the world who I know would come because of the interest in Africa and put they together and just let the spark fly so we buy a derelict hotel near Cape Town it be a 80 room art Deco hotel from the 1920 the area be kind of seedy so we get a 80 room hotel for 100 000 dollar it be a beautiful building we decide we would refurbish it and then put out the word we be go to start the good math institute in Africa in this hotel well the new South Africa be a very exciting country and that of you who have not be there you should go it be very very interesting what be happen and we recruit wonderful staff highly motivated staff the other thing that be happen which be good for we be the internet even though the internet be very expensive all over Africa there be internet cafe everywhere and bright young African be desperate to join the global community to be successful and they be very ambitious they want to be the next Einstein and so when word come out that aim be open it spread very quickly via e mail and we website and we get lot of applicant well we design AIMS as a 24 hour learning environment and it be fantastic to start a university from the begin you have to rethink what be the university for and that be really exciting so we design it to have interactive teaching no drone on at the chalkboard we emphasize problem solve work in group every student discover and maximize they own potential and not chase grade everyone live together in this hotel lecturer and student and it be not surprising at all to find a impromptu tutorial at 1 a m the student do not usually leave the computer lab till 2 or 3 a m and then they be up again at eight in the morning lecture problem solve and so on it be a extraordinary place we especially emphasize area of great relevance to Africa development because in that area scientist work in Africa will have a competitive advantage they will publish be invite to conference they will do well they will have successful career and aim have do extremely well here be a list of last year graduate graduate in June and what they be currently do 48 of they and where they be be indicate over here and where they have go so this be all postgraduate student and they have all go on to master and ph d degree in excellent place five student can be educate at aim for the cost of educate one in the U S or Europe but more important the pan African student body be a continual source of strength pride and commitment to Africa we illustrate aim progress by color in the country of Africa so here you can see behind this list when a county be color yellow we have receive a application orange we have accept a application and green a student have graduate so here be where we be after the first graduation in 2004 and we set ourselves a goal of turn the continent green so there be 2005 6 7 8 applause we be well on the way to achieve we initial goal we have some of the student film at home before they come to aim and I will just show you one Tendai Mugwagwa my name be Tendai Mugwagwa I have a bachelor of Science with a education degree I will be attend aim my understanding of the course be that it cover quite a lot you know from physics to medicine in particular epidemiology and also mathematical modeling Neil Turok so Tendai come to aim and do very well and I will let she take it from there tm my name be Tendai Mugwagwa and I be a student at aim in 2003 and 2004 after leave aim I go on to do a master in apply mathematics at the University of Cape Town in South Africa after that I come to the Netherlands where I be now do a ph d in theoretical immunology Professor Tendai be work very independently she communicate well with the immunologist at the hospital so all in all I have a very good ph d student from South Africa so I be happy she be here not another student in the first year of aim be Shehu and he be show here with he favorite high school teacher and then enter university in northern Nigeria and after AIMS Shehu want to do high energy physics and he come to Cambridge he be about to finish he ph d and he be film recently with someone you all know Shehu and from there we will be able to hopefully make good prediction and then we compare it to the graph and also make some prediction Stephen Hawking that be nice not here be the current student at aim there be 53 of they from 20 different country include 20 woman so now I be go to get to my TED business well we have a party this be Africa we have good party in Africa and last month they throw a surprise party for I here be somebody you have see already applause I want to point out a few other exceptional person in this picture so we be have a party as you can see they be completely eclipse I at this point this be Ezra she be from Darfur she be a physicist and somehow stay smile in spite of everything go on back home but she want to continue in physics and she be do extremely well this be Lydia Lydia be the first ever woman to graduate in mathematics in the central African Republic and she be now at aim applause so now let I get to we TED wish well it be not my TED wish it be we wish as you have already gather and we wish have two part one be a dream and the other a plan ok we TED dream be that the next Einstein will be African applause in strive for the height of creative genius we want to give thousand of person the motivation the encouragement and the courage to obtain the high level skill they need to help Africa among they will be not only brilliant scientist I be sure of that from what we have see at aim they will also be the African Gates Brins and Pages of the future well I say we also have a plan and we plan be quite simple aim be now a prove model and what we need to do be to replicate it we want to roll out 15 aim center in the next five year all over Africa each will have a pan African student body but specialize in a different area of science we want to use science to overcome the national and cultural barrier as it do at aim and we want to add element to the curriculum we want to add entrepreneurship and policy skill the expand aim will be a coherent pan African institution and its graduate will form a powerful network work together for peace and progress across the continent over the last year we have be visit site in Africa look at potential site for new aim center and here be the one we have select and each of this center have a strong local team each be in a beautiful place a interesting place which international lecturer will be happy to visit and we partner across Africa be extremely enthusiastic about this everyone want a aim center in they country and last November the conference of all the African minister of science and technology hold in Mombasa call for a comprehensive plan to roll out aim so we have political support right across the continent it will not be easy at every site there will be huge challenge local scientist must play lead role and government must be persuade to buy in condition be very difficult but we can not afford to compromise on that principle which make aim work and we summarize they this way the institute have get to be relevant innovative cost effective and high quality why because we want Africa to be rich Easy to remember the basic rule we need so just in end let I say the only person who can fix Africa be talented young African by unlock and nurture they creative potential we can create a step change in Africa future over time they will contribute to African development and to science in way we can only imagine thank you applause
