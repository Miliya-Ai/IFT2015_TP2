I be the lucky guy in the world I get to see the last case of killer smallpox in the world I be in India this past year and I may have see the last case of polio in the world there be nothing that make you feel more the blessing and the honor of work in a program like that than to know that something that horrible no long exist so I be go to tell you applause so I be go to show you some dirty picture they be difficult to watch but you should look at they with optimism because the horror of this picture will be match by the uplifting quality of know that they no long exist but first I be go to tell you a little bit about my own journey my background be not exactly the conventional medical education that you might expect when I be a intern in San Francisco I hear about a group of native American who have take over Alcatraz Island and a native American who want to give birth on that island and no other doctor want to go and help she give birth I go out to Alcatraz and I live on the island for several week she give birth I catch the baby I get off the island I land in San Francisco and all the press want to talk to I because my three week on the island make I a expert in Indian affair laughter I wind up on every television show someone see I on television they call I up and they ask I if I would like to be in a movie and to play a young doctor for a bunch of rock and roll star who be travel in a bus ride from San Francisco to England and I say yes I would do that so I become the doctor in a absolutely awful movie call Medicine Ball Caravan laughter now you know from the 60 you be either on the bus or you be off the bus I be on the bus my wife of 37 year and I join the bus we bus ride take we from San Francisco to London then we switch bus at the big pond we then get on two more bus and we drive through Turkey and Iran Afghanistan over the Khyber Pass into Pakistan like every other young doctor this be we at the Khyber Pass and that be we bus we have some difficulty get over the Khyber Pass but we wind up in India and then like everyone else in we generation we go to live in a himalayan monastery laughter this be just like a residency program for that of you that be in medical school laughter and we study with a wise man a guru name Karoli Baba who then tell I to get rid of the dress put on a three piece suit go join the United Nations as a diplomat and work for the World Health Organization and he make a outrageous prediction that smallpox would be eradicate and that this be God gift to humanity because of the hard work of dedicated scientist and that prediction come true this little girl be Rahima Banu and she be the last case of killer smallpox in the world and this document be the certificate that the global commission sign certify the world to have eradicate the first disease in history the key to eradicate smallpox be early detection early response I be go to ask you to repeat that early detection early response can you say that audience early detection early response Larry Brilliant Smallpox be the bad disease in history it kill more person than all the war in history in the last century it kill 500 million person you be read about Larry Page already somebody read very fast laughter in the year that Larry Page and Sergey Brin with whom I have a certain affection and a new affiliation in the year in which they be bear two million person die of smallpox we declare smallpox eradicate in 1980 this be the most important slide that I have ever see in public health sovereign kill by smallpox because it show you to be the rich and the strong and to be king and queen of the world do not protect you from die of smallpox never can you doubt that we be all in this together but to see smallpox from the perspective of a sovereign be the wrong perspective you should see it from the perspective of a mother watch she child develop this disease and standing by helplessly day one day two day three day four day five day six you be a mother and you be watch you child and on day six you see pustule that become hard Day seven they show the classic scar of smallpox umbilication day eight and Al Gore say early that the most photograph image in the world the most print image in the world be that of the Earth but this be in 1974 and as of that moment this photograph be the photograph that be the most widely print because we print two billion copy of this photograph and we take they hand to hand door to door to show person and ask they if there be smallpox in they house because that be we surveillance system we do not have Google we do not have web crawler we do not have computer by day nine you look at this picture and you be horrified I look at this picture and I say thank God because it be clear that this be only a ordinary case of smallpox and I know this child will live and by day 13 the lesion be scab he eyelid be swollen but you know this child have no other secondary infection and by day 20 while he will be scar for life he will live there be other kind of smallpox that be not like that this be confluent smallpox in which there be not a single place on the body where you could put a finger and not be cover by lesion flat smallpox which kill 100 percent of person who get it and hemorrhagic smallpox the most cruel of all which have a predilection for pregnant woman I have probably have 50 woman die they all have hemorrhagic smallpox I have never see anybody die from it who be not a pregnant woman in 1967 the who embark on what be a outrageous program to eradicate a disease in that year there be 34 country affect with smallpox by 1970 we be down to 18 country 1974 we be down to five country but in that year smallpox explode throughout India and India be the place where smallpox make its last stand in 1974 India have a population of 600 million there be 21 linguistic state in India which be like say 21 different country there be 20 million person on the road at any time in bus and train walk 500 000 village 120 million household and none of they want to report if they have a case of smallpox in they house because they think that smallpox be the visitation of a deity Shitala Mata the cool mother and it be wrong to bring stranger into you house when the deity be in the house no incentive to report smallpox it be not just India that have smallpox deity smallpox deity be prevalent all over the world so how we eradicate smallpox be mass vaccination would not work you could vaccinate everybody in India but one year later there would be 21 million new baby which be then the population of Canada it would not do just to vaccinate everyone you have to find every single case of smallpox in the world at the same time and draw a circle of immunity around it and that be what we do in India alone my 150 000 good friend and I go door to door with that same picture to every single house in India we make over one billion house call and in the process I learn something very important every time we do a house to house search we have a spike in the number of report of smallpox when we do not search we have the illusion that there be no disease when we do search we have the illusion that there be more disease a surveillance system be necessary because what we need be early detection early response so we search and we search and we find every case of smallpox in India we have a reward we raise the reward we continue to increase the reward we have a scorecard that we write on every house and as we do that the number of report case in the world drop to zero and in 1980 we declare the globe free of smallpox it be the large campaign in United Nations history until the Iraq war 150 000 person from all over the world doctor of every race religion culture and nation who fight side by side brother and sister with each other not against each other in a common cause to make the world well but smallpox be the fourth disease that be intend for eradication we fail three other time we fail against malaria yellow fever and yaw but soon we may see polio eradicate but the key to eradicate polio be early detection early response this may be the year we eradicate polio that will make it the second disease in history and David Heymann who be watch this on the webcast David keep on go we be close we be down to four country applause I feel like Hank Aaron Barry Bonds can replace I any time let get another disease off the list of terrible thing to worry about I be just in India work on the polio program the polio surveillance program be four million person go door to door that be the surveillance system but we need to have early detection early response blindness the same thing the key to discover blindness be do epidemiological survey and find out the cause of blindness so you can mount the correct response the Seva Foundation be start by a group of alumnus of the Smallpox Eradication Programme who have climb the high mountain taste the elixir of the success of eradicate a disease want to do it again and over the last 27 year Seva program in 15 country have give back sight to more than two million blind person Seva get start because we want to apply this lesson of surveillance and epidemiology to something which nobody else be look at as a public health issue blindness which heretofore have be think of only as a clinical disease in 1980 Steve Jobs give I that computer which be Apple number 12 and it be still in Kathmandu and it be still work and we ought to go get it and auction it off and make more money for Seva and we conduct the first Nepal survey ever do for health and the first nationwide blindness survey ever do and we have astonishing result instead of find out what we think be the case that blindness be cause mostly by glaucoma and trachoma we be astounded to find out that blindness be cause instead by cataract you can not cure or prevent what you do not know be there in you TED package there be a dvd infinite vision about Dr V and the Aravind Eye Hospital I hope that you will take a look at it Aravind which start as a Seva project be now the world large and good eye hospital this year that one hospital will give back sight to more than 300 000 person in Tamil Nadu India applause bird flu I stand here as a representative of all terrible thing this might be the bad the key to prevent or mitigate pandemic bird flu be early detection and rapid response we will not have a vaccine or adequate supply of a antiviral to combat bird flu if it occur in the next three year who stage the progress of a pandemic we be now at stage three on the pandemic alert stage with just a little bit of human to human transmission but no human to human to human sustained transmission the moment who say we have move to category four this will not be like Katrina the world as we know it will stop there will be no airplane fly would you get in a airplane with 250 person you do not know cough and sneeze when you know that some of they might carry a disease that could kill you for which you have no antiviral or vaccine I do a study of the top epidemiologist in the world in October I ask they this be all fluologist and specialist in influenza and I ask they the question you would like to ask they what do you think the likelihood be that there will be a pandemic if it happen how bad do you think it will be fifteen percent say they think there would be a pandemic within three year but much bad than that 90 percent say they think there would be a pandemic within you child or you grandchild lifetime and they think that if there be a pandemic a billion person would get sick as many as 165 million person would die there would be a global recession and depression as we just in time inventory system and the tight rubber band of globalization break and the cost to we economy of one to three trillion dollar would be far bad for everyone than merely 100 million person die because so many more person would lose they job and they healthcare benefit that the consequence be almost unthinkable and it be get bad because travel be get so much good let I show you a simulation of what a pandemic look like so we know what we be talk about let assume for example that the first case occur in South Asia it initially go quite slowly you get two or three discrete location then there will be secondary outbreak and the disease will spread from country to country so fast that you will not know what hit you within three week it will be everywhere in the world now if we have a undo button and we could go back and isolate it and grab it when it first start if we could find it early and we have early detection and early response and we could put each one of that virus in jail that be the only way to deal with something like a pandemic and let I show you why that be we have a joke this be a epidemic curve and everyone in medicine I think ultimately get to know what it be but the joke be a epidemiologist like to arrive at a epidemic right here and ride to glory on the downhill curve laughter but you do not get to do that usually you usually arrive right about here what we really want be to arrive right here so we can stop the epidemic but you can not always do that but there be a organization that have be able to find a way to learn when the first case occur and that be call GPHIN it be the global Public Health Information Network and that simulation that I show you that you think be bird flu that be SARS and SARS be the pandemic that do not occur and it do not occur because GPHIN find the pandemic to be of SARS three month before who actually announce it and because of that we be able to stop the SARS pandemic and I think we owe a great debt of gratitude to GPHIN and to Ron St John who I hope be in the audience some place over there who be the founder of GPHIN applause hello Ron applause and TED have fly Ron here from Ottawa where GPHIN be locate because not only do GPHIN find SARS early but you may have see last week that Iran announce that they have bird flu in Iran but GPHIN find the bird flu in Iran not February 14 but last September we need a early warning system to protect we against the thing that be humanity bad nightmare and so my TED wish be base on the common denominator of this experience Smallpox early detection early response blindness polio early detection early response pandemic bird flu early detection early response it be a litany it be so obvious that we only way of deal with this new disease be to find they early and to kill they before they spread so my TED wish be for you to help build a global system a early warning system to protect we against humanity bad nightmare and what I think I would call it be early detection but it should really be call total early detection TED laughter what applause what applause but in all seriousness because this idea be birthe in TED I would like it to be a legacy of TED and I would like to call it the International System for Total Early Disease Detection INSTEDD and INSTEDD then become we mantra so instead of a hidden pandemic of bird flu we find it and immediately contain it instead of a novel virus cause by bio terror or bio error or shift or drift we find it and we contain it instead of industrial accident like oil spill or the catastrophe in Bhopal we find they and we respond to they instead of famine hide until it be too late we detect it and we respond and instead of a system which be own by a government and hide in the bowels of government let build a early detection system that be freely available to anyone in the world in they own language let make it transparent non governmental not own by any single country or company house in a neutral country with redundant backup in a different time zone and a different continent and let build it on GPHIN let start with GPHIN let increase the website that they crawl from 20 000 to 20 million let increase the language they crawl from seven to 70 or more let build in outbound confirmation message use text message or sms or instant messaging to find out from person who be within 100 meter of the rumor that you hear if it be in fact valid and let add satellite confirmation and we will add Gapminder amazing graphic to the front end and we will grow it as a moral force in the world find out that terrible thing before anybody else know about they and send we response to they so that next year instead of we meet here lament how many terrible thing there be in the world we will have pull together use the unique skill and the magic of this community and be proud that we have do everything we can to stop pandemic other catastrophe and change the world begin right now applause Chris Anderson An amazing presentation First of all just so everyone understand you be say that by create web crawler look on the internet for pattern they can detect something suspicious before who before anyone else can see it give a example of how that could possibly be true Larry Brilliant you be not mad about the copyright violation ca no I love it laughter LB Well as Ron St John I hope you will go and meet he in the dinner afterwards and talk to he when he start GPHIN in 1997 there be a outbreak of bird flu h5n1 it be in Hong Kong and a remarkable doctor in Hong Kong respond immediately by slaughter 1 5 million chicken and bird and they stop that outbreak in its track Immediate detection immediate response then a number of year go by and there be a lot of rumor about bird flu Ron and he team in Ottawa begin to crawl the web only crawl 20 000 different website mostly periodical and they read about and hear about a concern of a lot of child who have high fever and symptom of bird flu they report this to who who take a little while take action because who will only receive a report from a government because it be the United Nations but they be able to point to who and let they know that there be this surprising and unexplained cluster of illness that look like bird flu that turn out to be SARS that be how the world find out about SARS and because of that we be able to stop SARS now what be really important be that before there be gphin 100 percent of all the world report of bad thing whether you be talk about famine or you be talk about bird flu or you be talk about Ebola 100 percent of all that report come from nation the moment this guy in Ottawa on a budget of 800 000 dollar a year get crack 75 percent of all the report in the world come from GPHIN 25 percent of all the report in the world come from all the other 180 nation now here be what be really interesting after they have be work for a couple year what do you think happen to that nation they feel pretty stupid so they start send in they report early and now they report percentage be down to 50 percent because other nation have start to report so can you find disease early by crawl the web of course you can can you find it even early than GPHIN do now of course you can you see that they find SARS use they Chinese web crawler a full six week before they find it use they English web crawler well they be only crawl in seven language this bad virus really do not have any intention of show up first in English or Spanish or French laughter so yes I want to take gphin I want to build on it I want to add all the language of the world that we possibly can I want to make this open to everybody so that the health officer in Nairobi or in Patna Bihar will have as much access to it as the folk in Ottawa or in CDC and I want to make it part of we culture that there be a community of person who be watch out for the bad nightmare of humanity and that it be accessible to everyone
