I grow up in Europe and World War II catch I when I be between seven and 10 year old and I realize how few of the grow up that I know be able to withstand the tragedy that the war visit on they how few of they could even resemble a normal contented satisfied happy life once they job they home they security be destroy by the war so I become interested in understand what contribute to a life that be worth live and I try as a child as a teenager to read philosophy and to get involve in art and religion and many other way that I could see as a possible answer to that question and finally I end up encounter psychology by chance I be at a ski resort in Switzerland without any money to actually enjoy myself because the snow have melt and I do not have money to go to a movie but I find that on the I read in the newspaper that there be to be a presentation by someone in a place that I have see in the center of Zurich and it be about fly saucer that he be go to talk and I think well since I can not go to the movie at least I will go for free to listen to fly saucer and the man who talk at that evening lecture be very interesting instead of talk about little green man he talk about how the psyche of the European have be traumatize by the war and now they be project fly saucer into the sky he talk about how the mandala of ancient hindu religion be kind of project into the sky as a attempt to regain some sense of order after the chaos of war and this seem very interesting to I and I start read he book after that lecture and that be Carl Jung whose name or work I have no idea about then I come to this country to study psychology and I start try to understand the root of happiness this be a typical result that many person have present and there be many variation on it but this for instance show that about 30 percent of the person survey in the United States since 1956 say that they life be very happy and that have not change at all whereas the personal income on a scale that have be hold constant to accommodate for inflation have more than double almost triple in that period but you find essentially the same result namely that after a certain basic point which correspond more or less to just a few 1 000 dollar above the minimum poverty level increase in material well be do not seem to affect how happy person be in fact you can find that the lack of basic resource material resource contribute to unhappiness but the increase in material resource do not increase happiness so my research have be focus more on after find out this thing that actually correspond to my own experience I try to understand where in everyday life in we normal experience do we feel really happy and to start that study about 40 year ago I begin to look at creative person first artist and scientist and so forth try to understand what make they feel that it be worth essentially spend they life do thing for which many of they do not expect either fame or fortune but which make they life meaningful and worth do this be one of the lead composer of American music back in the 70 and the interview be 40 page long but this little excerpt be a very good summary of what he be say during the interview and it describe how he feel when compose be go well and he say by describe it as a ecstatic state now ecstasy in Greek mean simply to stand to the side of something and then it become essentially a analogy for a mental state where you feel that you be not do you ordinary everyday routine so ecstasy be essentially a step into a alternative reality and it be interesting if you think about it how when we think about the civilization that we look up to as have be pinnacle of human achievement whether it be China Greece the Hindu civilization or the Mayas or Egyptian what we know about they be really about they ecstasy not about they everyday life we know the temple they build where person could come to experience a different reality we know about the circus the arena the theater this be the remains of civilization and they be the place that person go to experience life in a more concentrated more order form now this man do not need to go to a place like this which be also this place this arena which be build like a Greek amphitheatre be a place for ecstasy also we be participate in a reality that be different from that of the everyday life that we be use to but this man do not need to go there he need just a piece of paper where he can put down little mark and as he do that he can imagine sound that have not exist before in that particular combination so once he get to that point of begin to create like Jennifer do in she improvisation a new reality that be a moment of ecstasy he enter that different reality now he say also that this be so intense a experience that it feel almost as if he do not exist and that sound like a kind of a romantic exaggeration but actually we nervous system be incapable of process more than about 110 bit of information per second and in order to hear I and understand what I be say you need to process about 60 bit per second that be why you can not hear more than two person you can not understand more than two person talk to you well when you be really involve in this completely engaging process of create something new as this man be he do not have enough attention leave over to monitor how he body feel or he problem at home he can not feel even that he be hungry or tired he body disappear he identity disappear from he consciousness because he do not have enough attention like none of we do to really do well something that require a lot of concentration and at the same time to feel that he exist so existence be temporarily suspend and he say that he hand seem to be move by itself now I could look at my hand for two week and I would not feel any awe or wonder because I can not compose laughter so what it be tell you here be that obviously this automatic spontaneous process that he be describe can only happen to someone who be very well train and who have develop technique and it have become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity that you can not be create anything with less than 10 year of technical knowledge immersion in a particular field whether it be mathematics or music it take that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it be good than what be there before now when that happen he say the music just flow out and because all of this person I start interview this be a interview which be over 30 year old so many of the person describe this as a spontaneous flow that I call this type of experience the flow experience and it happen in different realm for instance a poet describe it in this form this be by a student of mine who interview some of the lead writer and poet in the United States and it describe the same effortless spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state this poet describe it as open a door that float in the sky a very similar description to what Albert Einstein give as to how he imagine the force of relativity when he be struggle with try to understand how it work but it happen in other activity for instance this be another student of mine Susan Jackson from Australia who do work with some of the lead athlete in the world and you see here in this description of a Olympic skater the same essential description of the phenomenology of the inner state of the person you do not think it go automatically if you merge yourself with the music and so forth it happen also actually in the most recent book I write call Good Business where I interview some of the ceo who have be nominate by they peer as be both very successful and very ethical very socially responsible you see that this person define success as something that help other and at the same time make you feel happy as you be work at it and like all of this successful and responsible ceo say you can not have just one of this thing be successful if you want a meaningful and successful job Anita Roddick be another one of this ceo we interview she be the founder of body shop the natural cosmetic king it be kind of a passion that come from do the good and have flow while you be work this be a interesting little quote from Masaru Ibuka who be at that time start out Sony without any money without a product they do not have a product they do not have anything but they have a idea and the idea he have be to establish a place of work where engineer can feel the joy of technological innovation be aware of they mission to society and work to they heart content I could not improve on this as a good example of how flow enter the workplace now when we do study we have with other colleague around the world do over 8 000 interview of person from Dominican monk to blind nun to himalayan climber to navajo shepherd who enjoy they work and regardless of the culture regardless of education or whatever there be this seven condition that seem to be there when a person be in flow there be this focus that once it become intense lead to a sense of ecstasy a sense of clarity you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other you get immediate feedback you know that what you need to do be possible to do even though difficult and sense of time disappear you forget yourself you feel part of something large and once the condition be present what you be do become worth do for its own sake in we study we represent the everyday life of person in this simple scheme and we can measure this very precisely actually because we give person electronic pager that go off 10 time a day and whenever they go off you say what you be do how you feel where you be what you be think about and two thing that we measure be the amount of challenge person experience at that moment and the amount of skill that they feel they have at that moment so for each person we can establish a average which be the center of the diagram that would be you mean level of challenge and skill which will be different from that of anybody else but you have a kind of a set point there which would be in the middle if we know what that set point be we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow and it will be when you challenge be high than average and skill be high than average and you may be do thing very differently from other person but for everyone that flow channel that area there will be when you be do what you really like to do play the piano be with you good friend perhaps work if work be what provide flow for you and then the other area become less and less positive Arousal be still good because you be over challenge there you skill be not quite as high as they should be but you can move into flow fairly easily by just develop a little more skill so arousal be the area where most person learn from because that be where they be push beyond they comfort zone and to enter that go back to flow then they develop high skill control be also a good place to be because there you feel comfortable but not very excited it be not very challenging any more and if you want to enter flow from control you have to increase the challenge so that two be ideal and complementary area from which flow be easy to go into the other combination of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal relaxation be fine you still feel ok boredom begin to be very aversive and apathy become very negative you do not feel that you be do anything you do not use you skill there be no challenge unfortunately a lot of person experience be in apathy the large single contributor to that experience be watch television the next one be be in the bathroom sit even though sometimes watch television about seven to eight percent of the time be in flow but that be when you choose a program you really want to watch and you get feedback from it so the question we be try to address and I be way over time be how to put more and more of everyday life in that flow channel and that be the kind of challenge that we be try to understand and some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously without any advice but unfortunately a lot of person do not and that be what we mandate be in a way to do thank you applause
