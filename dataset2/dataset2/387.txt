I be raise in Seoul Korea and move to New York City in 1999 to attend college I be pre med at the time and I think I would become a surgeon because I be interested in anatomy and dissect animal really pique my curiosity at the same time I fall in love with New York City I start to realize that I could look at the whole city as a live organism I want to dissect it and look into its unseen layer and the way to it for I be through artistic means so eventually I decide to pursue a MFA instead of a m d and in grad school I become interested in creature that dwell in the hidden corner of the city in New York City rat be part of commuter daily life most person ignore they or be frighten of they but I take a liking to they because they dwell on the fringe of society and even though they be use in lab to promote human life they be also consider pest I also start look around in the city and try to photograph they one day in the subway I be snap picture of the track hope to catch a rat or two and a man come up to I and say you can not take photograph here the mta will confiscate you camera I be quite shocked by that and think to myself well ok then I will follow the rat then I start go into the tunnel which make I realize that there be a whole new dimension to the city that I never see before and most person do not get to see around the same time I meet like minded individual who call themselves urban explorer adventurer spelunker guerrilla historian etc I be welcome into this loose internet base network of person who regularly explore urban ruin such as abandon subway station tunnel sewer aqueduct factory hospital shipyard and so on when I take photograph in this location I feel there be something miss in the picture simply document this soon to be demolish structure be not enough for I so I want to create a fictional character or a animal that dwell in this underground space and the simple way to do it at the time be to model myself I decide against clothing because I want the figure to be without any cultural implication or time specific element I want a simple way to represent a living body inhabit this decay derelict space this be take in the Riviera Sugar Factory in Red Hook Brooklyn it be now a empty six acre lot wait for a shopping mall right across from the new Ikea I be very fond of this space because it be the first massive industrial complex I find on my own that be abandon when I first go in I be scared because I hear dog bark and I think they be guard dog but they happen to be wild dog live there and it be right by the water so there be swan and duck swim around and tree grow everywhere and bee nest in the sugar barrel the nature have really reclaim the whole complex and in a way I want the human figure in the picture to become a part of that nature when I get comfortable in the space it also feel like a big playground I would climb up the tank and hop across expose beam as if I go back in time and become a child again this be take in the old Croton Aqueduct which supply fresh water to New York City for the first time the construction begin in 1837 it last about five year it get abandon when the new Croton Aqueducts open in 1890 when you go into space like this you be directly access the past because they sit untouched for decade I love feel the aura of a space that have so much history instead of look at reproduction of it at home you be actually feel the hand lay brick and shimmy up and down narrow crack and get wet and muddy and walk in a dark tunnel with a flashlight this be a tunnel underneath Riverside Park it be build in the 1930 by Robert Moses the mural be do by a graffiti artist to commemorate the hundred of homeless person that get relocate from the tunnel in 1991 when the tunnel reopen for train walk in this tunnel be very peaceful there be nobody around you and you hear the kid play in the park above you completely unaware of what be underneath when I be go out a lot to this place I be feel a lot of anxiety and isolation because I be in a solitary phase in my life and I decide to title my series Naked City spleen which reference Charles Baudelaire Naked City be a nickname for New York and spleen embody the melancholia and inertia that come from feel alienated in a urban environment this be the same tunnel you see the sunbeam come from the ventilation duct and the train approach this be a tunnel that be abandon in Hell Kitchen I be there alone set up and a homeless man approach I be basically intrude in he live space I be really frightened at first but I calmly explain to he that I be work on a art project and he do not seem to mind and so I go ahead and put my camera on self timer and run back and forth and when I be do he actually offer I he shirt to wipe off my foot and kindly walk I out it must have be a very unusual day for he laughter one thing that strike I after this incident be that a space like that hold so many delete memory of the city that homeless man to I really represent a element of the unconscious of the city he tell I that he be abuse above ground and be once in Riker Island and at last he find peace and quiet in that space the tunnel be once build for the prosperity of the city but be now a sanctuary for outcast who be completely forget in the average urban dweller everyday life this be underneath my alma mater Columbia University the tunnel be famous for have be use during the development of the Manhattan Project this particular tunnel be interesting because it show the original foundation of Bloomingdale Insane Asylum which be demolish in 1890 when Columbia move in this be the New York City farm colony which be a poorhouse in Staten Island from the 1890 to the 1930 most of my photo be set in place that have be abandon for decade but this be a exception this child hospital be close in 1997 it be locate in Newark when I be there three year ago the window be break and the wall be peel but everything be leave there as it be you see the autopsy table morgue tray x ray machine and even use utensil which you see on the autopsy table after explore recently abandon building I feel that everything could fall into ruin very fast you home you office a shopping mall a church any man make structure around you I be remind of how fragile we sense of security be and how vulnerable person truly be I love to travel and Berlin have become one of my favorite city it be full of history and also full of underground bunker and ruin from the war this be take under a homeless asylum build in 1885 to house 1 100 person I see the structure while I be on the train and I get off at the next station and meet person there that give I access to they catacomb like basement which be use for ammunition storage during the war and also at some point to hide group of Jewish refugee this be the actual catacombs in Paris I explore there extensively in the off limit area and fall in love right away there be more than 185 mile of tunnel and only about a mile be open to the public as a museum the first tunnel date back to 60 b c they be consistently dig as limestone quarry and by the 18th century the caving in of some of this quarry pose safety threat so the government order reinforce of the exist quarry and dig new observation tunnel in order to monitor and map the whole place as you can see the system be very complex and vast it be very dangerous to get lose in there and at the same time there be a problem in the city with overflow cemetery so the bone be move from the cemetery into the quarry make they into the catacombs the remains of over six million person be house in there some over 1 300 year old this be take under the Montparnasse Cemetery where most of the ossuary be locate there be also phone cable that be use in the 50 and many bunker from the World War II era this be a German bunker nearby there be a French bunker and the whole tunnel system be so complex that the two party never meet the tunnel be famous for have be use by the resistance which Victor Hugo write about in Les Miserables and I see a lot of graffiti from the 1800 like this one after explore the underground of Paris I decide to climb up and I climb a Gothic monument that be right in the middle of Paris this be the tower of Saint Jacques it be build in the early 1500 I do not recommend sit on a gargoyle in the middle of January naked it be not very comfortable laughter and all this time I never see a single rat in any of this place until recently when I be in the London sewer this be probably the tough place to explore I have to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fume I guess except for in this picture and when the tide of waste matter come in it sound as if a whole storm be approach you this be a still from a film I work on recently call Blind Door I have become more interested in capture movement and texture and the 16 mm black and white film give a different feel to it and this be the first theater project I work on I adapt and produce a dream play by August Strindberg it be perform last September one time only in the Atlantic Avenue tunnel in Brooklyn which be consider to be the old underground train tunnel in the world build in 1844 I have be lean towards more collaborative project like this lately but whenever I get a chance I still work on my series the last place I visit be the mayan ruin of Copan Honduras this be take inside a archaeological tunnel in the main temple I like do more than just explore this space I feel a obligation to animate and humanize this space continually in order to preserve they memory in a creative way before they be lose forever thank you
