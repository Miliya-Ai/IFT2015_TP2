about four year ago the New Yorker publish a article about a cache of dodo bone that be find in a pit on the island of Mauritius now the island of Mauritius be a small island off the east coast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean and it be the place where the dodo bird be discover and extinguish all within about 150 year everyone be very excited about this archaeological find because it mean that they might finally be able to assemble a single dodo skeleton see while museum all over the world have dodo skeleton in they collection nobody not even the actual natural history museum on the island of Mauritius have a skeleton that be make from the bone of a single dodo well this be not exactly true the fact be be that the British Museum have a complete specimen of a dodo in they collection up until the 18th century it be actually mummify skin and all but in a fit of space save zeal they actually cut off the head and they cut off the foot and they burn the rest in a bonfire if you go look at they website today they will actually list this specimen say the rest be lose in a fire not quite the whole truth anyway the frontispiece of this article be this photo and I be one of the person that think that Tina Brown be great for bring photo to the New Yorker because this photo completely rock my world I become obsessed with the object not just the beautiful photograph itself and the color the shallow depth of field the detail that be visible the wire you can see on the beak there that the conservator use to put this skeleton together there be a entire story here and I think to myself would not it be great if I have my own dodo skeleton laughter I want to point out here at this point that I have spend my life obsess by object and the story that they tell and this be the very late one so I begin look around for to see if anyone sell a kit some kind of model that I could get and I find lot of reference material lot of lovely picture no dice no dodo skeleton for I but the damage have be do I have save a few hundred photo of dodo skeleton into my Creative Projects folder it be a repository for my brain everything that I could possibly be interested in any time I have a internet connection there be a sluice of stuff move into there everything from beautiful ring to cockpit photo the key that the Marquis du Lafayette send to George Washington to celebrate the storm of the Bastille Russian nuclear launch key the one on the top be the picture of the one I find on eBay the one on the bottom be the one I make for myself because I could not afford the one on eBay Storm trooper costume map of Middle Earth that be one I hand draw myself there be the dodo skeleton folder this folder have 17 000 photo over 20 gigabyte of information and it be grow constantly and one day a couple of week later it might have be maybe a year later I be in the art store with my kid and I be buy some clay tool we be go to have a craft day I buy some Super Sculpeys some armature wire some various material and I look down at this Sculpey and I think maybe yeah maybe I could make my own dodo skull I should point out at this time I be not a sculptor I be a hard edge model maker you give I a drawing you give I a prop to replicate you give I a crane scaffolding part from Star Wars especially part from Star Wars I can do this stuff all day long it be exactly how I make my living for 15 year but you give I something like this my friend Mike Murnane sculpt this it be a maquette for Star Wars Episode two this be not my thing this be something other person do dragon soft thing however I feel like I have look at enough photo of dodo skull to actually be able to understand the topology and perhaps replicate it I mean it could not be that difficult so I start look at the good photo I could find I grab all the reference and I find this lovely piece of reference this be someone sell this on eBay it be clearly a woman hand hopefully a woman hand assume it be roughly the size of my wife hand I make some measurement of she thumb and I scale they out to the size of the skull I blow it up to the actual size and I begin use that along with all the other reference that I have compare it to it as size reference for figure out exactly how big the beak should be exactly how long etc and over a few hour I eventually achieve what be actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull and I do not mean to continue I it be kind of like you know you can only clean a super messy room by pick up one thing at a time you can not think about the totality I be not think about a dodo skeleton I just notice that as I finish this skull the armature wire that I have be use to hold it up be stick out of the back just where a spine would be and one of the other thing I have be interested in and obsess with over the year be spine and skeleton have collect a couple of hundred I actually understand the mechanic of vertebra enough to kind of start to imitate they and so button by button vertebra by vertebra I build my way down and actually by the end of the day I have a reasonable skull a moderately good vertebra and half of a pelvis and again I keep on go look for more reference every bit of reference I could find draw beautiful photo this guy I love this guy he put a dodo leg bone on a scanner with a ruler this be the kind of accuracy that I want and I replicate every last bone and put it in and after about six week I finish paint mount my own dodo skeleton you can see that I even make a museum label for it that include a brief history of the dodo and tap plastic make I although I do not photograph it a museum vitrine I do not have the room for this in my house but I have to finish what I have start and this actually represent kind of a sea change to I again like I say my life have be about be fascinate by object and the story that they tell and also make they for myself obtain they appreciate they and diving into they and in this folder Creative Projects there be ton of project that I be currently work on project that I have already work on thing that I might want to work on some day and thing that I may just want to find and buy and have and look at and touch but now there be potentially this new category of thing that I could sculpt that be different that I you know I have my own r2d2 but that be honestly relative to sculpt to I that be easy and so I go back and look through my Creative Projects folder and I happen across the Maltese Falcon now this be funny for I to fall in love with a object from a Hammett novel because if it be true that the world be divide into two type of person Chandler person and Hammett person I be absolutely a Chandler person but in this case it be not about the author it be not about the book or the movie or the story it be about the object in and of itself and in this case this object be play on a host of level first of all there be the object in the world this be the Kniphausen Hawk it be a ceremonial pour vessel make around 1700 for a Swedish Count and it be very likely the object from which Hammett draw he inspiration for the Maltese Falcon then there be the fictional bird the one that Hammett create for the book build out of word it be the engine that drive the plot of he book and also the movie in which another object be create a prop that have to represent the thing that Hammett create out of word inspire by the Kniphausen Hawk and this represent the falcon in the movie and then there be this fourth level which be a whole new object in the world the prop make for the movie the representative of the thing become in its own right a whole other thing a whole new object of desire and so now it be time to do some research I actually have do some research a few year before it be why the folder be there I have buy a replica a really crappy replica of the Maltese falcon on eBay and have download enough picture to actually have some reasonable reference but I discover in research further really want precise reference that one of the original lead bird have be sell at Christie in 1994 and so I contact a antiquarian bookseller who have the original christie catalogue and in it I find this magnificent picture which include a size reference I be able to scan the picture blow it up to exactly full size I find other reference Avi Ara Chekmayan a New Jersey editor actually find this resin Maltese falcon at a flea market in 1991 although it take he five year to authenticate this bird to the auctioneer specification because there be a lot of controversy about it it be make out of resin which be not a common material for movie prop about the time the movie be make it be funny to I that it take a while to authenticate it because I can see it compare to this thing and I can tell you it be real it be the real thing it be make from the exact same mold that this one be in this one because the auction be actually so controversial Profiles in History the auction house that sell this I think in 1995 for about 100 000 dollar they actually include you can see here on the bottom not just a front elevation but also a side rear and other side elevation so now I have all the topology I need to replicate the Maltese Falcon what do they do how do you start something like that I really do not know so what I do be again like I do with the dodo skull I blow all my reference up to full size and then I begin cut out the negative and use that template as shape reference so I take Sculpey and I build a big block of it and I pass it through until you know I get the right profile and then slowly feather by feather detail by detail I work out and achieve work in front of the television and Super Sculpey here be I sit next to my wife it be the only picture I take of the entire process as I move through I achieve a very reasonable facsimile of the Maltese falcon but again I be not a sculptor and so I do not know a lot of the trick like I do not know how my friend Mike get beautiful shiny surface with he Sculpey I certainly be not able to get it so I go down to my shop and I mold it and I cast it in resin because in the resin then I could absolutely get the glass smooth finish now there be a lot of way to fill and get yourself a nice smooth finish my preference be about 70 coat of this matte black auto primer I spray it on for about three or four day it drip to hell but it allow I a really really nice gentle sanding surface and I can get it glass smooth oh finish up with triple zero steel wool now the great thing about get it to this point be that because in the movie when they finally bring out the bird at the end and they place it on the table they actually spin it so I be able to actually screen shot and freeze frame to make sure and I be follow all the light kick on this thing and make sure that as I be hold the light in the same position I be get the same type of reflection on it that be the level of detail I be go into this thing I end up with this my Maltese Falcon and it be beautiful and I can state with authority at this point in time when I have finish it of all of the replica out there and there be a few this be by far the most accurate representation of the original Maltese falcon than anyone have sculpt now the original one I should tell you be sculpt by a guy name Fred Sexton this be where it get weird Fred Sexton be a friend of this guy George Hodel terrifying guy agree by many to be the killer of the Black Dahlia now James Ellroy believe that Fred Sexton the sculptor of the Maltese Falcon kill James Elroy mother I will go you one stranger than that in 1974 during the production of a weird comedy sequel to the Maltese Falcon call the black bird star George Segal the Los Angeles County Museum of Art have a plaster original of the Maltese falcon one of the original six plaster I think make for the movie steal out of the museum a lot of person think it be a publicity stunt for the movie John Grill which actually be see briefly in the Maltese falcon be still a viable San Francisco eatery count amongst its regular customer Elisha Cook who play Wilmer Cook in the movie and he give they one of he original plaster of the Maltese Falcon and they have it in they cabinet for about 15 year until it get steal in January of 2007 it would seem that the object of desire only come into its own by disappear repeatedly so here I have this Falcon and it be lovely it look really great the light work on it really well it be good than anything that I could achieve or obtain out in the world but there be a problem and the problem be that I want the entirety of the object I want the weight behind the object this thing be make of resin and it be too light there be this group online that I frequent it be a group of prop crazy just like I call the Replica Props Forum and it be person who trade make and travel in information about movie prop and it turn out that one of the guy there a friend of mine that I never actually meet but befriend through some prop deal be the manager of a local foundry he take my master Falcon pattern he actually do lose wax casting in bronze for I and this be the bronze I get back and this be after some acid etch the one that I end up with and this thing it be deeply deeply satisfy to I here I be go to put it out there later on tonight and I want you to pick it up and handle it you want to know how obsessed I be this project only for I and yet I go so far as to buy on eBay a 1941 Chinese San Francisco base newspaper in order so that the bird could properly be wrap like it be in the movie laughter yeah I know laughter applause there you can see it be weigh in at 27 and a half pound that be half the weight of my dog Huxley but there be a problem now here be the most recent progression of Falcons on the far leave be a piece of crap a replica I buy on eBay there be my somewhat ruin Sculpey Falcon because I have to get it back out of the mold there be my first casting there be my master and there be my bronze there be a thing that happen when you mold and cast thing which be that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin you lose a little bit of volume you lose a little bit of size and when I hold my bronze one up against my Sculpey one it be short by three quarter of a inch yeah no really this be like aah why do not I remember this why do not I start and make it big so what do I do I figure I have two option one I can fire a freak laser at it which I have already do to do a 3d scan there be a 3d scan of this Falcon I have figure out the exact amount of shrinkage I achieve go from a wax master to a bronze master and blow this up big enough to make a 3d lithography master of this which I will polish then I will send to the mold maker and then I will have it do in bronze or there be several person who own original and I have be attempt to contact they and reach they hope that they will let I spend a few minute in the presence of one of the real bird maybe to take a picture or even to pull out the hand hold laser scanner that I happen to own that fit inside a cereal box and could maybe without even touch they bird I swear get a perfect 3d scan and I be even willing to sign page say that I will never let anyone else have it except for I in my office I promise I will give they one if they want it and then maybe then I will achieve the end of this exercise but really if we be all go to be honest with ourselves I have to admit that achieve the end of the exercise be never the point of the exercise to begin with be it thank you
