I be kind of tired of talk about simplicity actually so I think I would make my life more complex as a serious play so I be go to like go through some slide from way back when and walk through they to give you a sense of how I end up here so basically it all begin with this whole idea of a computer who have a computer yeah o k so everyone have a computer even a mobile phone it be a computer and anyone remember this workbook instant activity for you Apple free poster in each book this be how computing begin do not forget a computer come out it have no software you would buy that thing you would bring it home you would plug it in and it would do absolutely nothing at all so you have to program it and there be great programming like tutorial like this I mean this be great it be like you know Herbie the Apple II it be such a great way to I mean they should make Java book like this and we have have no problem learn a program but this be a great grand time of the computer when it be just a raw raw what be it kind of a era and you see this era coincide with my own childhood I grow up in a tofu factory in Seattle who of you grow up in a family business suffer the torture yes yes the torture be good be not it good torture it be just life change you know and so in my life you know I be in the tofu it be a family business and my mother be a kind of a designer also she would make this kind of like wall of tofu cooking and it would confuse the customer because they all think it be a restaurant a bad sort of brand thing or whatever but anyway that be where I grow up in this little tofu factory in Seattle and it be kind of like this a small room where I kind of grow up I be big there in that picture that be my dad my dad be kind of like MacGyver really he would invent like way to make thing heavy like back here there be like concrete block technology here and he would need the concrete block to press the tofu because tofu be actually kind of a liquidy type of thing and so you have to have heavy stuff to push out the liquid and make it hard tofu come out in this big batch and my father would sort of cut they by hand I can not tell you family business story you would understand this my father be the most sincere man possible he walk into a Safeway once on a rainy day slip break he arm rush out he do not want to inconvenience Safeway so instead you know my father like arm break for two week in the store and that week now that two week be when my old brother and I have to do everything and that be torture real torture because you see we have see my father take the big block of tofu and cut it like knife in zap zap zap we think wow so the first time I do that I go like whoa like this bad block but anyways the tofu to I be kind of my origin basically and because work in a store be so hard I like go to school it be like heaven and I be really good at school so when I get to MIT you know as most of you who be creative you parent all tell you not to be creative right so same way you know I be good at art and good at math and my father say he be John good at math I go to MIT do my math but I have this wonderful opportunity because computer have just become visual the Apple Macintosh just come out I have a Mac in hand when I go to MIT and it be a time when a guy who kind of could cross the two side it be a good time and so I remember that my first major piece of software be on a direct copy of then Aldus PageMaker I make a desktop publishing system way back when and that be kind of my first step into figure out how to oh this two side be kind of fun to mix and the problem when you be young for all you student out there be you head get kind of big really easy and when I be make icon I be like the icon master and I be like yeah I be really good at this you know and then luckily you know I have the fortune of go to something call a library and in the library I come upon this very book I find this book it be call think on design by a man name Paul Rand it be a little slim volume I be not sure if you have see this it be a very nice little book it be about this guy Paul Rand who be one of the great graphic designer and also a great writer as well and when I see this man work I realize how bad I be at design or whatever I call it back then and I suddenly have a kind of career goal kind of in hot pursuit so I kind of switch I go to MIT finish I get my master and then go to art school after that and just begin to design stuff like chopstick wrapper napkin menu whatever I could get a handle on sort of wheel and deal move up in the design world whatever and be not it that strange moment when you publish you design remember that moment publish you design remember that moment it feel so good do not it so I be publish you know so wow my design in a book you know after that thing kind of get strange and I get think about the computer because the computer to I always kind of bother I I do not quite get it and Paul Rand be a kind of crusty designer you know a crusty designer like a good kind of like a good French bread you know he write in one of he book a Yale student once say I come here to learn how to design not how to use a computer design school take heed this be in the 80 in the great clash of computer non computer person a very difficult time actually and this to I be a important message from Rand and so I begin to sort of mess with the computer at the time this be the first sort of play thing I do my own serious play I build a work version of a Adobe Illustrator ish thing it look like Illustrator it can like draw it be very hard to make this actually it take a month to make this part and then I think what if I add this feature where I can say this point you can fly like a bird you be free kind of thing so I could sort of change the kind of stability with a little control there on the dial and I can sort of watch it flip around and this be in 1993 and when my professor see this they be very upset at I they be say why it move they be say make it stop now now I be say well that be the whole point it be move and he say well when it go to stop and I say never and he say even badly stop it now I start study this whole idea of like what be this computer it be a strange medium it be not like print it be not like video it last forever it be a very strange medium so I go off with this and begin to look for thing even more and so in Japan I begin to experiment with person this be actually bad human experiment I would do this thing where I would have student become pen there be blue pen red pen green pen black pen and someone sit down and draw a picture they be laugh because he say draw from the middle right to the middle and he kind of mess up see human do not know how to take order the computer so good at it this guy figure out how to get the computer to draw with two pen at once you know you pen do this and you pen do this and so begin to have multiple pen on the page again hard to do with we hand and then someone discover this a ha moment where you could use coordinate system we think ah this be when it be go to happen in the end he draw a house it be the most boring thing it become computerish we begin to think computerish the x y system and so that be kind of a revelation and after this I want to build a computer out of person call a human powered computer so this happen in 1993 sound down please it be a computer where the person be the part I have behind this wall a disk drive a cpu a graphic card a memory system they be pick up a giant floppy disk make of cardboard it be put inside the computer and that little program on that cardboard disk so she wear the disk and read the datum off the sector of the disk and the computer start up it sort of boot up really and it be a sort of a work computer and when I build this computer I have a moment of what be it call the epiphany where I realize that the computer just so fast this computer appear to be fast she be work pretty hard and person be run around and we think wow this be happen at a fast rate and this computer program to do only one thing which be if you move you mouse the mouse change on the screen on the computer when you move you mouse that arrow move around on this computer if you move the mouse it take half a hour for the mouse cursor to change to give you a sense of the speed the scale the computer be just so amazingly fast o k and so after this I begin to do experiment for different company this be something I do for Sony in 1996 it be three Sony h device that respond to sound so if you talk into the mike you will hear some music in you headphone if you talk in the phone then video would happen so I begin to experiment with industry in different way with this kind of mixture of skill I do this ad I do not believe in this kind of alcohol but I do drink sometimes and Chanel so get to do different project and also one thing I realize be that I like to make thing we like to make thing it be fun to make thing and so I never develop the ability to have a staff I have no staff it be all kind of make by hand this sort of broken hand and this hand be influence by this man Mr Inami Naomi this guy be my kind of like mentor he be the first digital media producer in Tokyo he be the guy that kind of discover I and kind of get I go in digital media he be such a inspirational guy I remember like we would be in he studio like at 2 a m and then he have show up from some client meeting he have come in and say you know if I be here everything be okay and you would feel so much good you know and I will never forget how like but I will never forget how like he have a sudden situation with he he have a aneurysm he go into a coma and so for three year he be out and he could only blink and so I realize at this moment I think wow how fragile be this thing we be wear this body and mind we be wear and so I think how do you go for it more how do you take that time you have leave and go after it so Naomi be pivotal in that and so I begin to think more carefully about the computer this be a moment where I be think about so you have a computer program it respond to motion x and y and I realize that each computer program have all this image inside the program so if you can see here you know that program you be see in the corner if you spread it out it be all this thing all at once it be real simultaneity it be nothing we be use to work with we be so use to work in one vector this be all at the same time the computer live in so many dimension and also at the same time I be frustrated because I would go to all this art and design school everywhere and there be this like the computer lab you know and this be like in the late 1990 and this be in Basel a great graphic design school and here be this like dirty kind of shoddy kind of dark computer room and I begin to wonder be this the goal be this what we want you know and also I begin to be fascinate by machine you know like copy machine and so this be actually in Basel I notice how we spend so much time on make it interactive this be like a touch screen and I notice how you can only touch five place and so why be we waste so much interactivity everywhere become a question and also the sound I discover I can make my ThinkPad pretend it be a telephone you get it no o k and also I discover in Logan airport this be like call out to I do you hear that it be like cow this be at 4 a m at Logan so I be wonder like what be this thing in front of I this computer thing it do not make any sense so I begin to make thing again this be another series of object make of old computer from my basement I make I take my old Macintoshes and make different object out of they from Tokyo I begin to be very disinterested in computer themselves so I begin to make painting out of PalmPilots I make this series of work they be paint I make and put a palmpilot in the middle as a kind of display that be sort of think I be abstract art what be I I be abstract and so it keep think out loud of its own abstraction I begin to be fascinate by plastic so I spend four month make eight plastic block perfectly optically transparent as a kind of release of stress because of that I become interested in blue tape so in San Francisco at C C I have a whole exhibition on blue tape I make a whole installation out of blue tape blue painter tape and at this point my wife kind of get worried about I so I stop do blue tape and begin to think well what else be there in life and so computer as you know this big computer there be now tiny computer they be little computer so the one chip computer I begin to program one chip computer and make object out of p c board lead I begin to make lead sculpture that would live inside little box out of MDF this be a series of light box I make for a show in Italy very simple box you just press one button and some lead interaction occur this be a series of lamp I make this be a Bento box lamp it be sort of a plastic rice lamp it be very friendly I do a show in London last year make out of iPods I use iPods as a material so I take 16 ipod Nanos and make a kind of a Nano fish basically recently this be for Reebok I have do shoe for Reebok as well as a kind of a hobby for apparel so anyways there be all this thing you can do but the thing I love the most be to experience taste the world the world be just so tasty we think we will go to a museum that be where all the taste be no they be all out there so this be like in front of the Eiffel Tower really actually around the Louvre area this I find where nature have make a picture for I this be a perfect 90 degree angle by nature in this strange moment where like this thing kind of appear we all be creative person we have this gene defect in we mind we can not help but stop right this feel a wonderful thing it be the forever always on museum this be from the Cape last year I discover that I have to find the equation of art and design which we know as circle triangle square it be everywhere on the beach I discover I begin to collect every instance of circle triangle square I put this all back by the way and I also discover how some rock be twin separate at birth this be also out there you know I be like how do this happen kind of thing I bring you guy together again so three year ago I discover the letter m i t occur in simplicity and complexity my alma mater mit and I have this moment a kind of m night shayamalan moment where I think whoa I have to do this and I go after it with passion however recently this risd opportunity kind of arise go to RISD and I could not reconcile this real easy because the letter have tell I MIT forever but I discover in the French word raison d tre I be like aha wait a second and there RISD appear and so I realize it be o k to go so I be go to risd actually who be a RISD alum out there RISD alum yeah RISD there we go RISD Woo RISD I be sorry I be sorry art Center Art Center be good too risd be kind of my new kind of passion and I will tell you a little bit about that so risd be I be outside risd and some student write this on some block and I think wow risd want to know what itself be and I have no idea what RISD should be actually or what it want to be but one thing I have to tell you be that although I be a technologist I do not like technology very much it be a kind of the qi thing or whatever person say be you go to bring risd into the future and I say well I be go to bring the future back to RISD there be my perspective because in reality the problem be not how to make the world more technological it be about how to make it more humane again and if anything I think RISD have a strange dna it be a strange exuberance about material about the world a fascination that I think the world need quite very much right now so thank you everyone
