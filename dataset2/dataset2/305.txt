whoa dude laughter check out that killer equation Sweet actually for the next 18 minute I be go to do the good I can to describe the beauty of particle physics without equation it turn out there be a lot we can learn from coral a coral be a very beautiful and unusual animal each coral head consist of thousand of individual polyp this polyp be continually bud and branch into genetically identical neighbor if we imagine this to be a hyperintelligent coral we can single out a individual and ask he a reasonable question we can ask how exactly he get to be in this particular location compare to he neighbor if it be just chance or destiny or what now after admonish we for turn the temperature up too high he would tell we that we question be completely stupid this coral can be kind of mean you see and I have surf scar to prove that but this polyp would continue and tell we that he neighbor be quite clearly identical copy of he that he be in all this other location as well but experience they as separate individual for a coral branching into different copy be the most natural thing in the world unlike we a hyperintelligent coral would be uniquely prepare to understand quantum mechanic the mathematics of quantum mechanic very accurately describe how we universe work and it tell we we reality be continually branch into different possibility just like a coral it be a weird thing for we human to wrap we mind around since we only ever get to experience one possibility this quantum weirdness be first describe by Erwin Schr dinger and he cat the cat like this version well laughter in this setup Schr dinger be in a box with a radioactive sample that by the law of quantum mechanic branch into a state in which it be radiate and a state in which it be not laughter in the branch in which the sample radiate it set off a trigger that release poison and Schr dinger be dead but in the other branch of reality he remain alive this reality be experience separately by each individual as far as either can tell the other one do not exist this seem weird to we because each of we only experience a individual existence and we do not get to see other branch it be as if each of we like Schr dinger here be a kind of coral branching into different possibility the mathematics of quantum mechanic tell we this be how the world work at tiny scale it can be sum up in a single sentence everything that can happen do that be quantum mechanic but this do not mean everything happen the rest of physics be about describe what can happen and what can not what physics tell we be that everything come down to geometry and the interaction of elementary particle and thing can happen only if this interaction be perfectly balanced now I will go ahead and describe how we know about this particle what they be and how this balance work in this machine a beam of proton and antiproton be accelerate to near the speed of light and bring together in a collision produce a burst of pure energy this energy be immediately convert into a spray of subatomic particle with detector and computer use to figure out they property this enormous machine the large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva have a circumference of 17 mile and when it be operate draw five time as much power as the city of Monterey we can not predict specifically what particle will be produce in any individual collision Quantum mechanic tell we all possibility be realize but physics do tell we what particle can be produce this particle must have just as much mass and energy as be carry in by the proton and antiproton any particle more massive than this energy limit be not produce and remain invisible to we this be why this new particle accelerator be so exciting it be go to push this energy limit seven time beyond what be ever be do before so we be go to get to see some new particle very soon but before talk about what we might see let I describe the particle we already know of there be a whole zoo of subatomic particle most of we be familiar with electron a lot of person in this room make a good living push they around laughter but the electron also have a neutral partner call the neutrino with no electric charge and a very tiny mass in contrast the up and down quark have very large mass and combine in three to make the proton and neutron inside atom all of this matter particle come in left and right handed variety and have antiparticle partner that carry opposite charge this familiar particle also have less familiar second and third generation which have the same charge as the first but have much high mass this matter particle all interact with the various force particle the electromagnetic force interact with electrically charge matter via particle call photon there be also a very weak force call rather unimaginatively the weak force laughter that interact only with left handed matter the strong force act between quark which carry a different kind of charge call color charge and come in three different variety red green and blue you can blame Murray Gell Mann for this name they be he fault finally there be the force of gravity which interact with matter via its mass and spin the most important thing to understand here be that there be a different kind of charge associate with each of this force this four different force interact with matter accord to the corresponding charge that each particle have a particle that have not be see yet but we be pretty sure exist be the Higgs particle which give mass to all this other particle the main purpose of the large Hadron Collider be to see this Higgs particle and we be almost certain it will but the great mystery be what else we might see and I be go to show you one beautiful possibility towards the end of this talk now if we count up all this different particle use they various spin and charge there be 226 that be a lot of particle to keep track of and it seem strange that nature would have so many elementary particle but if we plot they out accord to they charge some beautiful pattern emerge the most familiar charge be electric charge electron have a electric charge a negative one and quark have electric charge in third so when two up quark and a down quark be combine to make a proton it have a total electric charge of plus one this particle also have antiparticle which have opposite charge now it turn out the electric charge be actually a combination of two other charge hypercharge and weak charge if we spread out the hypercharge and weak charge and plot the charge of particle in this two dimensional charge space the electric charge be where this particle sit along the vertical direction the electromagnetic and weak force interact with matter accord to they hypercharge and weak charge which make this pattern this be call the unified electroweak model and it be put together back in 1967 the reason most of we be only familiar with electric charge and not both of this be because of the Higgs particle the Higgs over here on the left have a large mass and break the symmetry of this electroweak pattern it make the weak force very weak by give the weak particle a large mass since this massive Higgs sit along the horizontal direction in this diagram the photon of electromagnetism remain massless and interact with electric charge along the vertical direction in this charge space so the electromagnetic and weak force be describe by this pattern of particle charge in two dimensional space we can include the strong force by spread out its two charge direction and plot the charge of the force particle in quark along this direction the charge of all know particle can be plot in a four dimensional charge space and project down to two dimension like this so we can see they whenever particle interact nature keep thing in a perfect balance along all four of this charge direction if a particle and a antiparticle collide it create a burst of energy and a total charge of zero in all four charge direction at this point anything can be create as long as it have the same energy and maintain a total charge of zero for example this weak force particle and its antiparticle can be create in a collision in further interaction the charge must always balance one of the weak particle could decay into a electron and a antineutrino and this three still add to zero total charge Nature always keep a perfect balance so this pattern of charge be not just pretty they tell we what interaction be allow to happen and we can rotate this charge space in four dimension to get a good look at the strong interaction which have this nice hexagonal symmetry in a strong interaction a strong force particle such as this one interact with a colored quark such as this green one to give a quark with a different color charge this red one and strong interaction be happen million of time each second in every atom of we body hold the atomic nucleus together but this four charge correspond to three force be not the end of the story we can also include two more charge correspond to the gravitational force when we include this each matter particle have two different spin charge spin up and spin down so they all split and give a nice pattern in six dimensional charge space we can rotate this pattern in six dimension and see that it be quite pretty right now this pattern match we good current knowledge of how nature be build at the tiny scale of this elementary particle this be what we know for certain some of this particle be at the very limit of what we have be able to reach with experiment from this pattern we already know the particle physics of this tiny scale the way the universe work at this tiny scale be very beautiful but now I be go to discuss some new and old idea about thing we do not know yet we want to expand this pattern use mathematics alone and see if we can get we hand on the whole enchilada we want to find all the particle and force that make a complete picture of we universe and we want to use this picture to predict new particle that we will see when experiment reach high energy so there be a old idea in particle physics that this know pattern of charge which be not very symmetric could emerge from a more perfect pattern that get break similar to how the Higgs particle break the electroweak pattern to give electromagnetism in order to do this we need to introduce new force with new charge direction when we introduce a new direction we get to guess what charge the particle have along this direction and then we can rotate it in with the other if we guess wisely we can construct the standard charge in six charge dimension as a broken symmetry of this more perfect pattern in seven charge dimension this particular choice correspond to a grand unified theory introduce by Pati and Salam in 1973 when we look at this new unified pattern we can see a couple of gap where particle seem to be miss this be the way theory of unification work a physicist look for large more symmetric pattern that include the establish pattern as a subset the large pattern allow we to predict the existence of particle that have never be see this unification model predict the existence of this two new force particle which should act a lot like the weak force only weak now we can rotate this set of charge in seven dimension and consider a odd fact about the matter particle the second and third generation of matter have exactly the same charge in six dimensional charge space as the first generation this particle be not uniquely identify by they six charge they sit on top of one another in the standard charge space however if we work in eight dimensional charge space then we can assign unique new charge to each particle then we can spin this in eight dimension and see what the whole pattern look like here we can see the second and third generation of matter now relate to the first generation by a symmetry call triality this particular pattern of charge in eight dimension be actually part of the most beautiful geometric structure in mathematics it be a pattern of the large exceptional lie group e8 this lie group be a smooth curved shape with 248 dimension each point in this pattern correspond to a symmetry of this very complex and beautiful shape one small part of this e8 shape can be use to describe the curved space time of Einstein general relativity explain gravity together with quantum mechanic the geometry of this shape could describe everything about how the universe work at the tiny scale the pattern of this shape live in eight dimensional charge space be exquisitely beautiful and it summarize thousand of possible interaction between this elementary particle each of which be just a facet of this complicated shape as we spin it we can see many of the other intricate pattern contain in this one and with a particular rotation we can look down through this pattern in eight dimension along a symmetry axis and see all the particle at once it be a very beautiful object and as with any unification we can see some hole where new particle be require by this pattern there be 20 gap where new particle should be two of which have be fill by the Pati Salam particle from they location in this pattern we know that this new particle should be scalar field like the Higgs particle but have color charge and interact with the strong force fill in this new particle complete this pattern give we the full e8 this e8 pattern have very deep mathematical root it be consider by many to be the most beautiful structure in mathematics it be a fantastic prospect that this object of great mathematical beauty could describe the truth of particle interaction at the small scale imaginable and this idea that nature be describe by mathematics be not at all new in 1623 Galileo write this Nature grand book which stand continually open to we gaze be write in the language of mathematics its character be triangle circle and other geometrical figure without which it be humanly impossible to understand a single word of it without this one be wander around in a dark labyrinth I believe this to be true and I have try to follow Galileo guidance in describe the mathematics of particle physics use only triangle circle and other geometrical figure of course when other physicist and I actually work on this stuff the mathematics can resemble a dark labyrinth but it be reassure that at the heart of this mathematics be pure beautiful geometry join with quantum mechanic this mathematics describe we universe as a grow e8 coral with particle interact at every location in all possible way accord to a beautiful pattern and as more of the pattern come into view use new machine like the large Hadron Collider we may be able to see whether nature use this e8 pattern or a different one this process of discovery be a wonderful adventure to be involve in if the LHC find particle that fit this e8 pattern that will be very very cool if the LHC find new particle but they do not fit this pattern well that will be very interesting but bad for this e8 theory and of course bad for I personally laughter now how bad would that be well pretty bad laughter but predict how nature work be a very risky game this theory and other like it be long shot one do a lot of hard work know that most of this idea probably will not end up be true about nature that be what do theoretical physics be like there be a lot of wipeout in this regard new physics theory be a lot like start up company as with any large investment it can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research when it be not work out but in science if something be not work you have to toss it out and try something else now the only way to maintain sanity and achieve happiness in the midst of this uncertainty be to keep balance and perspective in life I have try the good I can to live a balanced life laughter I try to balance my life equally between physics love and surf my own three charge direction laughter this way even if the physics I work on come to nothing I still know I have live a good life and I try to live in beautiful place for most of the past ten year I have live on the island of Maui a very beautiful place now it be one of the great mystery in the universe to my parent how I manage to survive all that time without engage in anything resemble full time employment laughter I be go to let you in on that secret this be a view from my home office on Maui and this be another and another and you may have notice that this beautiful view be similar but in slightly different place that be because this use to be my home and office on Maui laughter I have choose a very unusual life but not worry about rent allow I to spend my time do what I love live a nomadic existence have be hard at time but it be allow I to live in beautiful place and keep a balance in my life that I have be happy with it allow I to spend a lot of my time hang out with hyperintelligent coral but I also greatly enjoy the company of hyperintelligent person so I be very happy to have be invite here to TED thank you very much applause Chris Anderson stay here one second applause I probably understand two percent of that but I still absolutely love it so I be go to sound dumb you theory of everything Garrett Lisi I be use to coral ca that be right the reason it be get a few person at least excited be because if you be right it bring gravity and quantum theory together so be you say that we should think of the universe at its heart that the small thing that there be be somehow a e8 object of possibility I mean be there a scale to it at the small scale or gl well right now the pattern I show you that correspond to what we know about elementary particle physics that already correspond to a very beautiful shape and that be the one that I say we know for certain and that shape have remarkable similarity and the way it fit into this e8 pattern which could be the rest of the picture and this pattern of point that I have show for you actually represent symmetry of this high dimensional object that would be warp and move and dance over the space time that we experience and that would be what explain all this elementary particle that we see CA but a string theorist as I understand it explain electron in term of much small string vibrate I know you do not like string theory vibrate inside it how should we think of a electron in relation to e8 gl well it would be one of the symmetry of this e8 shape so what be happen be as the shape be move over space time it be twist and the direction it be twist as it move be what particle we see so it would be CA the size of the e8 shape how do that relate to the electron I feel like I need that for my picture be it big be it small gl as far as we know electron be point particle so this would be go down to the small possible scale so the way this thing be explain in quantum field theory be all possibility be expand and develop at once and this be why I use the analogy to coral and in this way the way that e8 come in be it will be as a shape that be attach at each point in the space time and as I say the way the shape twist the directional along which way the shape be twist as it move over this curved surface be what the elementary particle be themselves so through quantum field theory they manifest themselves as point and interact that way I do not know if I will be able to make this any clear laughter ca it do not really matter it be evoke a kind of sense of wonder and I certainly want to understand more of this but thank you so much for come that be absolutely fascinating applause
