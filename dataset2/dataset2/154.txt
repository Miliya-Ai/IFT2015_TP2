so I guess it be a result of globalization that you can find Coca Cola tin on top of Everest and a buddhist monk in Monterey laughter and so I just come two day ago from the Himalayas to you kind invitation so I would like to invite you also for a while to the Himalayas themselves and to show the place where meditator like I who begin with be a molecular biologist in Pasteur Institute and find they way to the mountain so this be a few image I be lucky to take and be there there be Mount Kailash in Eastern Tibet wonderful setting this be from Marlboro country laughter this be a turquoise lake a meditator this be the hot day of the year somewhere in Eastern Tibet on August 1 and the night before we camp and my Tibetan friend say we be go to sleep outside and I say why we have enough space in the tent they say yes but it be summertime laughter so now we be go to speak of happiness as a Frenchman I must say that there be a lot of French intellectual that think happiness be not at all interesting laughter I just write a essay on happiness and there be a controversy and someone write a article say do not impose on we the dirty work of happiness laughter we do not care about be happy we need to live with passion we like the up and downs of life we like we suffering because it be so good when it cease for a while laughter this be what I see from the balcony of my hermitage in the Himalayas it be about two meter by three and you be all welcome any time laughter now let come to happiness or well be and first of all you know despite what the French intellectual say it seem that no one wake up in the morning think may I suffer the whole day laughter which mean that somehow consciously or not directly or indirectly in the short or the long term whatever we do whatever we hope whatever we dream somehow be relate to a deep profound desire for well be or happiness as Pascal say even the one who hang himself somehow be look for cessation of suffer he find no other way but then if you look in the literature East and West you can find incredible diversity of definition of happiness some person say I only believe in remember the past imagine the future never the present some person say happiness be right now it be the quality of the freshness of the present moment and that lead Henri Bergson the French philosopher to say all the great thinker of humanity have leave happiness in the vague so that each of they could define they own term well that would be fine if it be just a secondary preoccupation in life but now if it be something that be go to determine the quality of every instant of we life then we well know what it be have some clear idea and probably the fact that we do not know that be why so often although we seek happiness it seem we turn we back to it although we want to avoid suffer it seem we be run somewhat towards it and that can also come from some kind of confusion one of the most common one be happiness and pleasure but if you look at the characteristic of that two pleasure be contingent upon time upon its object upon the place it be something that change of nature beautiful chocolate cake first serve be delicious second one not so much then we feel disgust laughter that be the nature of thing we get tired I use to be a fan of Bach I use to play it on the guitar you know I can hear it two three five time if I have to hear it 24 hour non stop it might be very tiring if you be feel very cold you come near a fire it be so wonderful after some moment you just go a little back and then it start burn it sort of use itself as you experience it and also again it can also it be something that you it be not something that be radiate outside like you can feel intense pleasure and some other around you can be suffer a lot now what then will be happiness and happiness of course be such a vague word so let say well be and so I think the good definition accord to the buddhist view be that well be be not just a mere pleasurable sensation it be a deep sense of serenity and fulfillment a state that actually pervade and underlie all emotional state and all the joy and sorrow that can come one way for you that might be surprising can we have this kind of well be while be sad in a way why not because we be speak of a different level look at the wave come near the shore when you be at the bottom of the wave you hit the bottom you hit the solid rock when you be surf on the top you be all elated so you go from elation to depression there be no depth now if you look at the high sea there might be beautiful calm ocean like a mirror there might be storm but the depth of the ocean be still there unchanged so now how be that it can only be a state of be not just a fleeting emotion sensation even joy that can be the spring of happiness but there be also wicked joy you can rejoice in someone suffering so how do we proceed in we quest for happiness very often we look outside we think that if we could gather this and that all the condition something that we say everything to be happy to have everything to be happy that very sentence already reveal the doom destruction of happiness to have everything if we miss something it collapse and also when thing go wrong we try to fix the outside so much but we control of the outer world be limited temporary and often illusory so now look at inner condition be not they strong be not it the mind that translate the outer condition into happiness and suffering and be not that strong we know by experience that we can be what we call a little paradise and yet be completely unhappy within the Dalai Lama be once in Portugal and there be a lot of construction go on everywhere so one evening he say look you be do all this thing but be not it nice also to build something within and he say without that even if you get a high tech flat on the 100th floor of a super modern and comfortable building if you be deeply unhappy within all you be go to look for be a window from which to jump so now at the opposite we know a lot of person who in very difficult circumstance manage to keep serenity inner strength inner freedom confidence so now if the inner condition be strong of course the outer condition do influence and it be wonderful to live long healthy to have access to information education to be able to travel to have freedom it be highly desirable however this be not enough that be just auxiliary help condition the experience that translate everything be within the mind so then when we ask oneself how to nurture the condition for happiness the inner condition and which be that which will undermine happiness so then this just need to have some experience we have to know from ourselves there be certain state of mind that be conducive to this flourish to this well be what the Greek call eudaimonia flourish there be some which be adverse to this well be and so if we look from we own experience anger hatred jealousy arrogance obsessive desire strong grasp they do not leave we in such a good state after we have experience it and also they be detrimental to other happiness so we may consider that the more that be invade we mind and like a chain reaction the more we feel miserable we feel torment at the opposite everyone know deep within that a act of selfless generosity if from the distance without anyone know anything about it we could save a child life make someone happy we do not need the recognition we do not need any gratitude just the mere fact of do that fill such a sense of adequation with we deep nature and we would like to be like that all the time so be that possible to change we way of be to transform one mind be not that negative emotion or destructive emotion inherent to the nature of mind be change possible in we emotion in we trait in we mood for that we have to ask what be the nature of mind and if we look from the experiential point of view there be a primary quality of consciousness that be just the mere fact to be cognitive to be aware consciousness be like a mirror that allow all image to rise on it you can have ugly face beautiful face in the mirror the mirror allow that but the mirror be not taint be not modify be not alter by that image likewise behind every single thought there be the bare consciousness pure awareness this be the nature it can not be taint intrinsically with hatred or jealousy because then if it be always there like a dye that would permeate the whole cloth then it would be find all the time somewhere we know we be not always angry always jealous always generous so because the basic fabric of consciousness be this pure cognitive quality that differentiate it from a stone there be a possibility for change because all emotion be fleeting that be the ground for mind training mind training be base on the idea that two opposite mental factor can not happen at the same time you could go from love to hate but you can not at the same time toward the same object the same person want to harm and want to do good you can not in the same gesture shake hand and give a blow so there be natural antidote to emotion that be destructive to we inner well be so that be the way to proceed rejoice compare to jealousy a kind of sense of inner freedom as opposite to intense grasp and obsession benevolence love kindness against hatred but of course each emotion then would need a particular antidote another way be to try to find a general antidote to all emotion and that be by look at the very nature usually when we feel annoyed hatred or upset with someone or obsess with something the mind go again and again to that object each time it go to the object it reinforce that obsession or that annoyance so then it be a self perpetuate process so what we need to look for now be instead of look outward we look inward look at anger itself it look very menacing like a billow monsoon cloud or thunderstorm we think we could sit on the cloud but if you go there it be just mist likewise if you look at the thought of anger it will vanish like frost under the morning sun if you do this again and again the propensity the tendency for anger to arise again will be less and less each time you dissolve it and at the end although it may rise it will just cross the mind like a bird cross the sky without leave any track so this be the principal of mind training now it take time because it take time for all that fault in we mind the tendency to build up so it will take time to unfold they as well but that be the only way to go mind transformation that be the very meaning of meditation it mean familiarization with a new way of be new way of perceive thing which be more in adequation with reality with interdependence with the stream and continuous transformation which we be and we consciousness be so the interface with cognitive science since we need to come to that it be I suppose the subject of we have to deal in such a short time with brain plasticity the brain be think to be more or less fixed all the nominal connection in number and quantity be think until the last 20 year to be more or less fix when we reach adult age now recently it have be find that it can change a lot a violinist as we hear who have do 10 000 hour of violin practice some area that control the movement of finger in the brain change a lot increase reinforcement of the synaptic connection so can we do that with human quality with love kindness with patience with openness so that be what that great meditator have be do some of they who come to the lab like in Madison Wisconsin or in Berkeley do 20 to 40 000 hour of meditation they do like three year retreat where they do meditate 12 hour a day and then the rest of they life they will do three or four hour a day they be real Olympic champion of mind training laughter this be the place where the meditator you can see it be kind of inspire now here with 256 electrode laughter so what do they find of course same thing the scientific embargo if it be ever submit to Nature hopefully it will be accept it deal with the state of compassion unconditional compassion we ask meditator who have be do that for year and year to put they mind in a state where there be nothing but love kindness total availability to sentient be of course during the training we do that with object we think of person suffer of person we love but at some point it can be a state which be all pervade here be the preliminary result which I can show because it be already be show the bell curve show 150 control and what be be look at be the difference between the right and the left frontal lobe in very short person who have more activity in the right side of the prefrontal cortex be more depressed withdraw they do not describe a lot of positive affect it be the opposite on the left side more tendency to altruism to happiness to express and curiosity and so forth so there be a basic line for person and also it can be change if you see a comic movie you go off to the left side if you be happy about something you will go more to the left side if you have a bout of depression you will go to the right side here the 0 5 be the full standard deviation of a meditator who meditate on compassion it be something that be totally out of the bell curve so I have no time to go into all the different scientific result hopefully they will come but they find that this be after three and a half hour in a fmri it be like come out of a space ship also it have be show in other lab for instance Paul Ekman lab in Berkeley that some meditator be able also to control they emotional response more than it could be think like the startle experiment for example if you sit a guy on a chair with all this apparatus measure you physiology and there be kind of a bomb that go off it be such a instinctive response that in 20 year they never see anyone who would not jump some meditator without try to stop it but simply by be completely open thinking that that bang be just go to be a small event like a shooting star they be able not to move at all so the whole point of that be not sort of to make like a circus thing of show exceptional being who can jump or whatever it be more to say that mind training matter that this be not just a luxury this be not a supplementary vitamin for the soul this be something that be go to determine the quality of every instant of we life we be ready to spend 15 year achieve education we love to do jogging fitness we do all kind of thing to remain beautiful yet we spend surprisingly little time take care of what matter most the way we mind function which again be the ultimate thing that determine the quality of we experience now compassion be suppose to be put in action that be what we try to do in different place just this one example be worth a lot of work this lady with bone tb leave alone in a tent be go to die with she only daughter one year late how she be different school and clinic we have be do in Tibet and just I leave you with the beauty of that look that tell more about happiness than I could ever say laughter and jump monk of Tibet laughter Flying monk thank you very much
