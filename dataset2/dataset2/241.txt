probably a lot of you know the story of the two salesman who go down to Africa in the 1900 they be send down to find if there be any opportunity for sell shoe and they write telegram back to Manchester and one of they write Situation hopeless stop they do not wear shoe and the other one write glorious opportunity they do not have any shoe yet laughter now there be a similar situation in the classical music world because there be some person who think that classical music be die and there be some of we who think you be not see nothing yet and rather than go into statistics and trend and tell you about all the orchestra that be close and the record company that be fold I think we should do a experiment tonight actually it be not really a experiment because I know the outcome laughter but it be like a experiment now before we start laughter before we start I need to do two thing one be I want to remind you of what a seven year old child sound like when he play the piano maybe you have this child at home he sound something like this music music end I see some of you recognize this child now if he practice for a year and take lesson he be now eight and he sound like this music music end he practice for another year and take lesson he be nine music music end then he practice for another year and take lesson now he be 10 music music end at that point they usually give up laughter applause now if you have wait for one more year you would have hear this music music end now what happen be not maybe what you think which be he suddenly become passionate engaged involved get a new teacher he hit puberty or whatever it be what actually happen be the impulse be reduce you see the first time he be play with a impulse on every note music and the second with a impulse every other note music you can see it by look at my head laughter the nine year old put a impulse on every four note music the 10 year old on every eight note music and the 11 year old one impulse on the whole phrase music I do not know how we get into this position laughter I do not say I be go to move my shoulder over move my body no the music push I over which be why I call it one buttock play music it can be the other buttock music you know a gentleman be once watch a presentation I be do when I be work with a young pianist he be the president of a corporation in Ohio I be work with this young pianist and say the trouble with you be you be a two buttock player you should be a one buttock player I move he body while he be play and suddenly the music take off it take flight the audience gasp when they hear the difference then I get a letter from this gentleman he say I be so moved I go back and I transform my entire company into a one buttock company laughter now the other thing I want to do be to tell you about you there be 1 600 person I believe my estimation be that probably 45 of you be absolutely passionate about classical music you adore classical music you fm be always on that classical dial you have cd in you car and you go to the symphony you child be play instrument you can not imagine you life without classical music that be the first group quite small then there be another big group the person who do not mind classical music laughter you know you have come home from a long day and you take a glass of wine and you put you foot up a little Vivaldi in the background do not do any harm that be the second group now come the third group person who never listen to classical music it be just simply not part of you life you might hear it like second hand smoke at the airport laughter and maybe a little bit of a march from Aida when you come into the hall but otherwise you never hear it that be probably the large group and then there be a very small group this be the person who think they be tone deaf amazing number of person think they be tone deaf actually I hear a lot my husband be tone deaf laughter actually you can not be tone deaf nobody be tone deaf if you be tone deaf you could not change the gear on you car in a stick shift car you could not tell the difference between somebody from Texas and somebody from Rome and the telephone the telephone if you mother call on the miserable telephone she call and say hello you not only know who it be you know what mood she be in you have a fantastic ear everybody have a fantastic ear so nobody be tone deaf but I tell you what it do not work for I to go on with this thing with such a wide gulf between that who understand love and be passionate about classical music and that who have no relationship to it at all the tone deaf person they be no longer here but even between that three category it be too wide a gulf so I be not go to go on until every single person in this room downstairs and in Aspen and everybody else look will come to love and understand classical music so that be what we be go to do now you notice that there be not the slight doubt in my mind that this be go to work if you look at my face right it be one of the characteristic of a leader that he not doubt for one moment the capacity of the person he be lead to realize whatever he be dream imagine if Martin Luther King have say I have a dream of course I be not sure they will be up to it laughter all right so I be go to take a piece of Chopin this be a beautiful prelude by Chopin some of you will know it music do you know what I think probably happen here when I start you think how beautiful that sound music I do not think we should go to the same place for we summer holiday next year laughter it be funny be not it it be funny how that think kind of waft into you head and of course applause of course if the piece be long and you have have a long day you might actually drift off then you companion will dig you in the rib and say wake up it be culture and then you feel even bad laughter but have it ever occur to you that the reason you feel sleepy in classical music be not because of you but because of we do anybody think while I be play why be he use so many impulse if I have do this with my head you certainly would have think it Music Music end and for the rest of you life every time you hear classical music you will always be able to know if you hear that impulse so let see what be really go on here we have a b this be a b the next note be a c and the job of the c be to make the b sad and it do do not it laughter composer know that if they want sad music they just play that two note music but basically it be just a b with four sad laughter now it go down to a now to G and then to f so we have B A G F and if we have B A G F what do we expect next music that might have be a fluke let try it again music oh the TED choir laughter and you notice nobody be tone deaf right nobody be you know every village in Bangladesh and every hamlet in China everybody know da da da da da everybody know who be expect that e Chopin do not want to reach the e there because what will have happen it will be over like Hamlet do you remember Act one scene three he find out he uncle kill he father he keep on go up to he uncle and almost kill he and then he back away he go up to he again almost kill he the critic sit in the back row there they have to have a opinion so they say Hamlet be a procrastinator or they say Hamlet have a Oedipus complex no otherwise the play would be over stupid laughter that be why Shakespeare put all that stuff in Hamlet Ophelia go mad the play within the play and Yorick skull and the gravedigger that be in order to delay until Act five he can kill he it be the same with the Chopin he be just about to reach the e and he say oops good go back up and do it again so he do it again now he get excited music that be excitement do not worry about it now he get to F sharp and finally he go down to e but it be the wrong chord because the chord he be look for be this one and instead he do now we call that a deceptive cadence because it deceive we I tell my student if you have a deceptive cadence raise you eyebrow and everybody will know laughter applause right he get to e but it be the wrong chord now he try e again that chord do not work now he try the e again that chord do not work now he try e again and that do not work and then finally there be a gentleman in the front row who go mmm laughter it be the same gesture he make when he come home after a long day turn off the key in he car and say Aah I be home because we all know where home be so this be a piece which go from away to home I be go to play it all the way through and you be go to follow b c b c b c b down to a down to g down to F almost go to e but otherwise the play would be over he go back up to b he get very excited go to f sharp go to e it be the wrong chord it be the wrong chord and finally go to e and it be home and what you be go to see be one buttock play laughter because for I to join the b to the e I have to stop think about every single note along the way and start think about the long long line from b to e you know we be just in South Africa and you can not go to South Africa without think of Mandela in jail for 27 year what be he think about lunch no he be think about the vision for South Africa and for human being this be about vision this be about the long line like the bird who fly over the field and do not care about the fence underneath all right so now you be go to follow the line all the way from b to e and I have one last request before I play this piece all the way through would you think of somebody who you adore who be no longer there a beloved grandmother a lover somebody in you life who you love with all you heart but that person be no long with you bring that person into you mind and at the same time follow the line all the way from b to e and you will hear everything that Chopin have to say Music Music end applause now you may be wonder applause applause end you may be wonder why I be clapping well I do this at a school in Boston with about 70 seventh grader 12 year old I do exactly what I do with you and I explain the whole thing at the end they go crazy clapping I be clapping they be clapping finally I say why be I clapping and one of they say because we be listen laughter think of it 1 600 person busy person involve in all sort of different thing listen understanding and be move by a piece by Chopin now that be something be I sure that every single person follow that understand it be move by it of course I can not be sure but I will tell you what happen to I in Ireland during the trouble 10 year ago and I be work with some catholic and Protestant kid on conflict resolution and I do this with they a risky thing to do because they be street kid and one of they come to I the next morning and he say you know I have never listen to classical music in my life but when you play that shopping piece laughter he say my brother be shoot last year and I do not cry for he but last night when you play that piece he be the one I be think about and I feel the tear stream down my face and it feel really good to cry for my brother so I make up my mind at that moment that classical music be for everybody everybody now how would you walk my profession the music profession do not see it that way they say three percent of the population like classical music if only we could move it to four percent we problem would be over laughter how would you walk how would you talk how would you be if you think three percent of the population like classical music if only we could move it to four percent how would you walk or talk how would you be if you think everybody love classical music they just have not find out about it yet see this be totally different world now I have a amazing experience I be 45 year old I have be conduct for 20 year and I suddenly have a realization the conductor of a orchestra do not make a sound my picture appear on the front of the cd laughter but the conductor do not make a sound he depend for he power on he ability to make other person powerful and that change everything for I it be totally life change person in my orchestra say Ben what happen that be what happen I realize my job be to awaken possibility in other person and of course I want to know whether I be do that how do you find out you look at they eye if they eye be shine you know you be do it you could light up a village with this guy eye laughter right so if the eye be shine you know you be do it if the eye be not shine you get to ask a question and this be the question who be I be that my player eye be not shine we can do that with we child too who be I be that my child eye be not shine that be a totally different world now we be all about to end this magical on the mountain week we be go back into the world and I say it be appropriate for we to ask the question who be we be as we go back out into the world and you know I have a definition of success for I it be very simple it be not about wealth and fame and power it be about how many shine eye I have around I so now I have one last thought which be that it really make a difference what we say the word that come out of we mouth I learn this from a woman who survive Auschwitz one of the rare survivor she go to Auschwitz when she be 15 year old and and she brother be eight and the parent be lose and she tell I this she say we be in the train go to Auschwitz and I look down and see my brother shoe be miss I say why be you so stupid can not you keep you thing together for goodness sake the way a eld sister might speak to a young brother unfortunately it be the last thing she ever say to he because she never see he again he do not survive and so when she come out of Auschwitz she make a vow she tell I this she say I walk out of Auschwitz into life and I make a vow and the vow be I will never say anything that could not stand as the last thing I ever say now can we do that no and we will make ourselves wrong and other wrong but it be a possibility to live into thank you applause shine eye applause shine eye applause thank you thank you
