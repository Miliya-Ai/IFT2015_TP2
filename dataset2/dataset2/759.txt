what they say they say the print media be die who say that well the media but this be no news right you have read about it already laughter lady and gentleman the world have get small I know it be a cliche but look look how small how tiny it have get and you know the reason why of course this be because of technology yeah laughter any computer designer in the room yeah well you guy be make my life miserable because track pad use to be round a nice round shape that make a good cartoon but what be you go to do with a flat track pad that square thing there be nothing I can do as a cartoonist well I know the world be flat now that be true and the internet have reach every corner of the world the poor the remote place every village in Africa now have a cyber cafe laughter do not go ask for

lifestyle tech guru like this man that a German magazine call the philosopher of the 21st century they be shape the way we do thing they be shape the way we consume they be shape we very desire laughter applause you will not like it and technology have even change we relationship to God laughter now I should not get into this Religion and political cartoon as you may have hear make a difficult couple ever since that day of 2005 when a bunch of cartoonist in Denmark draw cartoon that have repercussion all over the world demonstration fatwa they provoke violence person die in the violence this be so sickening person die because of cartoon I mean I have the feeling at the time that cartoon have be use by both side actually they be use first by a Danish newspaper which want to make a point on Islam a Danish cartoonist tell I he be one of the 24 who receive the assignment to draw the prophet 12 of they refuse do you know that he tell I nobody have to tell I what I should draw this be not how it work and then of course they be use by extremist and politician on the other side they want to stir up controversy you know the story we know that cartoon can be use as weapon history tell we they have be use by the Nazi to attack the Jews and here we be now in the United Nations half of the world be push to penalize the offense to religion they call it the defamation of religion while the other half of the world be fight back in defense of freedom of speech so the clash of civilization be here and cartoon be at the middle of it this get I think now you see I think at my kitchen table and since you be in my kitchen please meet my wife laughter in 2006 a few month after I go Ivory Coast Western Africa now talk of a divided place the country be cut in two you have a rebellion in the North the government in the South the capital Abidjan and in the middle the French army this look like a giant hamburger you do not want to be the ham in the middle I be there to report on that story in cartoon I have be do this for the last 15 year it be my side job if you want so you see the style be different this be more serious than maybe editorial cartooning I go to place like Gaza during the war in 2009 so this be really journalism in cartoon you will hear more and more about it this be the future of journalism I think and of course I go to see the rebel in the north that be poor guy fight for they right there be a ethnic side to this conflict as very often in Africa and I go to see the Dozo the Dozo they be the traditional hunter of West Africa People fear they they help the rebellion a lot they be believe to have magical power they can disappear and escape bullet I go to see a Dozo chief he tell I about he magical power he say I can chop you head off right away and bring you back to life I say well maybe we do not have time for this right now laughter another time so back in Abidjan I be give a chance to lead a workshop with local cartoonist there and I think yes in a context like this cartoon can really be use as weapon against the other side I mean the press in Ivory Coast be bitterly divide it be compare to the media in Rwanda before the genocide so imagine and what can a cartoonist do sometimes editor would tell they cartoonist to draw what they want to see and the guy have to feed he family right so the idea be pretty simple we bring together cartoonist from all side in Ivory Coast we take they away from they newspaper for three day and I ask they to do a project together tackle the issue affect they country in cartoon yes in cartoon show the positive power of cartoon it be a great tool of communication for bad or for good and cartoon can cross boundary as you have see and humor be a good way I think to address serious issue and I be very proud of what they do I mean they do not agree with each other that be not the point and I do not ask they to do nice cartoon the first day they be even shout at each other but they come up with a book look back at 13 year of political crisis in Ivory Coast so the idea be there and I have be do project like this in 2009 in Lebanon this year in Kenya back in January in Lebanon it be not a book the idea be to have the same principal a divided country take cartoonist from all side and let they do something together so in Lebanon we enrol the newspaper editor and we get they to publish eight cartoonist from all side all together on the same page address the issue affect Lebanon like religion in politics and everyday life and it work for three day almost all the newspaper of Beirut publish all that cartoonist together anti government pro government Christian Muslim of course English speak well you name it so this be a great project and then in Kenya what we do be address the issue of ethnicity which be a poison in a lot of place in Africa and we do video clip you can see they if you go to YouTube Kenyatoons so preach for freedom of speech be easy here but as you have see in context of repression or division again what can a cartoonist do he have to keep he job well I believe that in any context anywhere he always have the choice at least not to do a cartoon that will feed hatred and that be the message I try to convey to they I think we all always have the choice in the end not to do the bad thing but we need to support this unclear critical and responsible voice in Africa in Lebanon in you local newspaper in the Apple store today tech company be the world large editor they decide what be too offensive or too provocative for you to see so really it be not about the freedom of cartoonist it be about you freedom and for dictator all over the world the good news be when cartoonist journalist and activist shut up thank you applause
