I grow up in Northern Ireland right up in the very very north end of it there where it be absolutely freeze cold this be I run around in the back garden mid summer laughter I could not pick a career in Ireland the obvious choice be the military but to be honest it actually kind of suck laughter my mother want I to be a dentist but the problem be that person keep blow everything up so I actually go to school in Belfast which be where all the action happen and this be a pretty common sight the school I go to be pretty boring they force we to learn thing like latin the school teacher be not have much fun the sport be very dirty or very painful so I cleverly choose rowing which I get very good at and I be actually rowing for my school here until this fateful day and I flip over right in front of the entire school and that be the finish post right there laughter so this be extremely embarrassing but we school at that time get a grant from the government and they get a incredible computer the research machine 3dz and they leave the programming manual lie around and so student like myself with nothing to do we would learn how to program it also around this time at home this be the computer that person be buy it be call the Sinclair ZX80 this be a 1k computer and you would buy you program on cassette tape actually I be just go to pause for one second because I hear that there be a prerequisite to speak here at TED you have to have a picture of yourself from the old day with big hair so I bring a picture with big hair laughter I just want to get that out of the way so after the Sinclair ZX80 come along the very cleverly name Sinclair zx81 laughter and you see the picture at the bottom there be a picture of a guy do homework with he son that be what they think they have build it for the reality be we get the programming manual and we start make game for it we be program in basic which be a pretty awful language for game so we end up learn Assembly language so we could really take control of the hardware this be the guy that invent it Sir Clive Sinclair and he be show he machine you have this same thing in America it be call the Timex Sinclair1000 to play a game in that day you have to have a imagination to believe that you be really play Battlestar Galactica the graphic be just horrible you have to have a even good imagination to play this game death Rider but of course the scientist could not help themselves they start make they own video game this be one of my favorite one here where they have rabbit breeding so male choose the lucky rabbit it be around this time we go from 1k to 16k which be quite the leap and if you be wonder how much 16k be this eBay logo here be 16k and in that amount of memory someone program a full flight simulation program and that be what it look like I spend age fly this flight simulator and I honestly believe I could fly airplane by the end of it here be Clive Sinclair now launch he color computer he be recognize as be the father of video game in Europe he be a multi millionaire and I think that be why he be smile in this photograph so I go on for the next 20 year or so make a lot of different game some of the highlight be thing like the Terminator Aladdin the teenage mutant hero turtle because I be from the United Kingdom they think the word ninja be a little too mean for child so they decide to call it hero instead I personally prefer the Spanish version which be Tortugas Ninja that be much good laughter then the last game I do be base on try to get the video game industry and Hollywood to actually work together on something instead of licensing from each other to actually work now Chris do ask I to bring some statistics with I so I have do that the video game industry in 2005 become a 29 billion dollar business it grow every year last year be the big year by 2008 we be go to kick the butt of the music industry by 2010 we be go to hit 42 billion 43 percent of gamer be female so there be a lot more female gamer than person be really aware the average age of gamer well obviously it be for child right well no actually it be 30 year old and interestingly the person who buy the most game be 37 so 37 be we target audience all video game be violent of course the newspaper love to beat on this but 83 percent of game do not have any mature content whatsoever so it be just not true online gaming statistics I bring some stuff on World of Warcraft it be 5 5 million player it make about 80 million buck a month in subscription it cost 50 buck just to install it on you computer make the publisher about another 275 million the game cost about 80 million dollar to make so basically it pay for itself in about a month a player in a game call Project Entropia actually buy he own island for 26 500 dollar you have to remember that this be not a real island he do not actually buy anything just some datum but he get great term on it this purchase include mining and hunting right ownership of all land on the island and a castle with no furniture include laughter this market be now estimate at over 800 million dollar annually and what be interesting about it be the market be actually create by the gamer themselves they find clever way to trade item and to sell they account to each other so that they could make money while they be play they game I dive onto eBay a couple of day ago just to see what be gong on type in World of Warcraft get 6 000 item I like this one the good a level 60 warlock with lot of epic for 174 000 dollar it be like that guy obviously have some pain while make it so as far as popularity of game what do you think this person be do here it turn out they be actually in Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles listen to the L A Philharmonic play video game music that be what the show look like you would expect it to be cheesy but it be not it be very very epic and a very beautiful concert and the person that go there absolutely love it what do you think this person be do they be actually bring they computer so they can play game against each other and this be happen in every city around the world this be happen in you local city too you be probably just not aware of it now Chris tell I that you have a timeline video a few year ago here just to show how video game graphic have be improve I want to update that video and give you a new look at it but what I want you to do be to try to understand it we be on this curve and the graphic be get so ridiculously good and I be go to show you up to maybe 2007 but I want you to try and think about what game could look like 10 year from now so we be go to start that video video throughout human history person have play game as man intellect and technology have evolve so too have the game he play music applause David Perry the thing again I want you to think about be do not look at this graphic and think of that be the way it be think about that be where we be right now and the curve that we be on means that this be go to continue to get good this be a example of the kind of graphic you need to be able to draw if you want to get a job in the video game industry today you need to be really a incredible artist and once we get enough of that guy we be go to want more fantasy artist that can create place we have never be to before or character that we have just never see before so the obvious thing for I to talk about today be graphic and audio but if you be to go to a game developer conference what they be all talk about be emotion purpose mean understanding and feel you will hear about talk like can a video game make you cry and this be the kind of topic we really actually care about I come across a student who be absolutely excellent at express himself and this student agree that he would not show he video to anybody until you here at TED have see it so I would like to play this video so this be a student opinion on what he experience of game be Video I like many of you live somewhere between reality and video game some part of I a true living breathing person have become program electronic and virtual the boundary of my brain that divide real from fantasy have finally begin to crumble I be a video game addict and this be my story music in the year of my birth the Nintendo Entertainment System also go into development I play in the backyard learn to read and even eat some of my vegetable most of my childhood be spend play with Legos but as be the case for most of my generation I spend a lot of time in front of the tv Mr Rogers Walt Disney Nick Junior and roughly half a million commercial have undoubtedly leave they mark on I when my parent buy my sister and I we first Nintendo whatever inherent addictive quality this early interactive electronic entertainment possess quickly take hold of I at some point something click Music with the combination of simple interactive story and the warmth of the tv set my simple 16 bit Nintendo become more than just a escape it become a alternate existence my virtual reality music I be a video game addict and it be not because of a certain number of hour I have spend play or night I have go without sleep to finish the next level it be because I have have life alter experience in virtual space and video game have begin to erode my own understanding of what be real and what be not I be addicted because even though I know I be lose my grip on reality I still crave more music from a early age I learn to invest myself emotionally in what unfold before I on screen today after 20 year of watch tv gear to make I emotional even a decent insurance commercial can bring tear to my eye I be just one of a new generation that be grow up a generation who may experience much more meaning through video game than they will through the real world video game be near a evolutionary leap a point where game world will look and feel just as real as the film we see in theatre or the news we watch on tv and while my sense of free will in this virtual world may still be limit what I do learn apply to my real life play enough video game and eventually you will really believe you can snowboard fly a plane drive a nine second quarter mile or kill a man I know I can unlike any pop culture phenomenon before it video game actually allow we to become part of the machine they allow we to sublimate into the culture of interactive download streaming hd reality we be interact with we entertainment I have come to expect this level of interaction without it the problem face in the real world poverty war disease and genocide lack the levity they should they importance blend into the sensationalized drama of prime time tv but the beauty of video game today lie not in the lifelike graphic the vibrate joystick or virtual surround sound it lie in that this game be begin to make I emotional I have fight in war fear for my own survival watch my cohort die on beach and wood that look and feel more real than any textbook or any news story the person who create this game be smart they know what make I scared excited panicked proud or sad then they use this emotion to dimensionalize the world they create a well design video game will seamlessly weave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience as one become more experienced the awareness of physical control melt away I know what I want and I do it no button to push no trigger to pull just I and the game my fate and the fate of the world around I lie inside my hand I know violent video game make my mother worry what trouble I be not that video game violence be become more and more like real life violence but that real life violence be start to look more and more like a video game music this be all trouble outside of myself I however have a problem very close to home something have happen to my brain music perhaps there be a single part of we brain that hold all of we gut instinct the thing we know to do before we even think while some of this instinct may be innate most be learn and all of they be hardwire into we brain this instinct be essential for survival in both real and virtual world only in recent year have the technology behind video game allow for a true overlap in stimulus as gamer we be now live by the same law of physics in the same city and do many of the same thing we once do in real life only virtually consider this my real life car have about 25 000 mile on it in all my driving game I have drive a total of 31 459 mile to some degree I have learn how to drive from the game the sensory cue be very similar it be a funny feeling when you have spend more time do something on the tv than you have in real life when I be drive down a road at sunset all I can think be this be almost as beautiful as my game be for my virtual world be perfect more beautiful and rich than the real world around we I be not sure what the implication of my experience be but the potential for use realistic video game stimulus in repetition on a vast number of loyal participant be frightening to I today I believe big brother would find much more success brainwashing the mass with video game rather than just simply tv video game be fun engaging and leave you brain completely vulnerable to re programming but maybe brainwashing be not always bad imagine a game that teach we to respect each other or help we to understand the problem we be all face in the real world there be a potential to do good as well it be critical as this virtual world continue to mirror the real world we live in that game developer realize that they have tremendous responsibility before they I be not sure what the future of video game hold for we civilization but as virtual and real world experience increasingly overlap there be a great and great potential for other person to feel the same way I do what I have only recently come to realize be that beyond the graphic sound game play and emotion it be the power to break down reality that be so fascinating and addictive to I I know that I be lose my grip part of I be just wait to let go I know though that no matter how amazing video game may become or how flat the real world may seem to we that we must stay aware of what we game be teach we and how they leave we feel when we finally do unplug applause dp wow applause I find that video very very think provoke and that be why I want to bring it here for you guy to see and what be interesting about it be the obvious choice for I to talk about be graphic and audio but as you hear Michael talk about all this other element as well Video game give a awful lot of other thing too and that be why person get so addicted the most important one be fun the name of this track be the Magic to come who be that go to come from be it go to come from the good director in the world as we think it probably would I do not think so I think it be go to come from the child who be grow up now that be not stick with all of the stuff that we remember from the past they be go to do it they way use the tool that we have create the same with student or highly creative person writer and person like that as far as college go there be about 350 college around the world teach video game course that mean there be literally thousand of new idea some of the idea be really dreadful and some of they be great there be nothing bad than have to listen to someone try and pitch you a really bad video game idea laughter Chris Anderson you be off you be off that be it he be out of time dp I have just get a little tiny bit more if you will indulge I CA go ahead I be go to stay right here though laughter dp this be just a cool shot because this be student come to school after class the school be close they be come back at midnight because they want to pitch they video game idea I be sit at the front of the class and they be actually pitch they idea so it be hard to get student to come back to class but it be possible this be my daughter she name Emma she be 17 month old and I have be ask myself what be Emma go to experience in the video game world and as I have show here we have the audience she be never go to know a world where you can not press a button and have million of person ready to play you know we have the technology she be never go to know a world where the graphic just be not stunning and really immersive and as the student video show we can impact and move she be never go to know a world where video game be not incredibly emotional and will probably make she cry I just hope she like video game laughter so my closing think Games on the surface seem simple entertainment but for that that like to look a little deep the new paradigm of video game could open entirely new frontier to creative mind that like to think big where good to challenge that mind than here at TED thank you Chris Anderson David Perry that be awesome
