I want you to imagine that you be a student in my lab what I want you to do be to create a biologically inspire design and so here be the challenge I want you to help I create a fully 3d dynamic parameterized contact model the translation of that be could you help I build a foot and it be a true challenge and I do want you to help I of course in the challenge there be a prize it be not quite the TED Prize but it be a exclusive t shirt from we lab so please send I you idea about how to design a foot now if we want to design a foot what do we have to do we have to first know what a foot be if we go to the dictionary it say it be the low extremity of a leg that be in direct contact with the ground in stand or walk that be the traditional definition but if you want to really do research what do you have to do you have to go to the literature and look up what be know about foot so you go to the literature laughter maybe you be familiar with this literature the problem be there be many many foot how do you do this you need to survey all foot and extract the principle of how they work and I want you to help I do that in this next clip as you see this clip look for principle and also think about experiment that you might design in order to understand how a foot work see any common theme principle what would you do what experiment would you run wow applause we research on the biomechanic of animal locomotion have allow we to make a blueprint for a foot it be a design inspire by nature but it be not a copy of any specific foot you just look at but it be a synthesis of the secret of many many foot now it turn out that animal can go anywhere they can locomote on substrate that vary as you see in the probability of contact the movement of that surface and the type of foothold that be present if you want to study how a foot work we be go to have to simulate that surface or simulate that debris when we do that here be a new experiment that we do we put a animal and have it run this grass spider on a surface with 99 percent of the contact area remove but it do not even slow down the animal it be still run at the human equivalent of 300 mile per hour now how could it do that well look more carefully when we slow it down 50 time we see how the leg be hit that simulated debris the leg be act as a foot and in fact the animal contact other part of its leg more frequently than the traditionally define foot the foot be distribute along the whole leg you can do another experiment where you can take a cockroach with a foot and you can remove its foot I be pass some cockroach around take a look at they foot without a foot here be what it do it do not even slow down it can run the same speed without even that segment no problem for the cockroach they can grow they back if you care how do they do it look carefully this be slow down 100 time and watch what it be do with the rest of its leg it be act again as a distribute foot very effective now the question we have be how general be a distribute foot and the next behavior I will show you of this animal just stun we the first time that we see it Journalists this be off the record it be embargo take a look at what that be that be a bipedal octopus that be disguise as a rolling coconut it be discover by Christina Huffard and film by Sea Studios right here from Monterey we have also describe another species of bipedal octopus this one disguise itself as float alga it walk on two leg and it hold the other arm up in the air so that it can not be see applause and look what it do with its foot to get over challenging terrain it use that beautiful distribute foot to make it as if that obstacle be not even there truly extraordinary in 1951 Escher make this drawing he think he create a animal fantasy but we know that art imitate life and it turn out nature three million year ago evolve the next animal it be a shrimp like animal call the stomatopod and here be how it move on the beach of Panama it actually roll and it can even roll uphill it be the ultimate distribute foot its whole body in this case be act like its foot so if we want to then to we blueprint add the first important feature we want to add distribute foot contact not just with the traditional foot but also the leg and even of the body can this help we inspire the design of novel robot we biologically inspire this robot name RHex build by this extraordinary engineer over the last few year RHex foot start off to be quite simple then it get tune over time and ultimately result in this half circle why be that the video will show you watch where the robot now contact its leg in order to deal with this very difficult terrain what you will see in fact be that it be use that half circle leg as a distribute foot watch it go over this you can see it here well on this debris extraordinary no sense all the control be build right into the tune leg really simple but beautiful now you might have notice something else about the animal when they be run over the rough terrain and my assistant be go to help I here when you touch the cockroach leg can you get the microphone for he when you touch the cockroach leg what do it feel like do you notice something Boy Spiny Robert full it be spiny right it be really spiny be not it it sort of hurt maybe we could give it to we curator and see if he would be brave enough to touch the cockroach laughter Chris Anderson do you touch it RF so if you look carefully at this what you see be that they have spine and until a few week ago no one know what they do they assume that they be for protection and for sensory structure we find that they be for something else here be a segment of that spine they be tune such that they easily collapse in one direction to pull the leg out from debris but they be stiff in the other direction so they capture disparity in the surface now crab do not miss foothold because they normally move on sand until they come to we lab and where they have a problem with this kind of mesh because they do not have spine the crab be miss spine so they have a problem in this kind of rough terrain but of course we can deal with that because we can produce artificial spine we can make spine that catch on simulated debris and collapse on removal to easily pull they out we do that by put this artificial spine on crab as you see here and then we test they do we really understand that principle of tuning the answer be yes this be slow down 20 fold and the crab just zoom across that simulated debris laughter applause a little good than nature so to we blueprint we need to add tune spine now will this help we think about the design of more effective climbing robot well here be RHex RHex have trouble on rail on smooth rail as you see here so why not add a spine my colleague do this at U Penn Dan Koditschek put some steel nail very simple version on the robot and here be RHex now go over that steel that rail no problem how do it do it let slow it down and you can see the spine in action watch the leg come around and you will see it grab on right there it could not do that before it would just slip and get stuck and tip over and watch again right there successful now just because we have a distribute foot and spine do not mean you can climb vertical surface this be really really difficult but look at this animal do it one of the one I be pass around be climb up this vertical surface that be a smooth metal plate it be extraordinary how fast it can do it but if you slow it down you see something that be quite extraordinary it be a secret the animal effectively climb by slip and look and do actually terribly with respect to grab on the surface it look in fact like it be swim up the surface we can actually model that behavior well as a fluid if you look at it the distribute foot actually be work more like a paddle the same be true when we look at this lizard run on fluidized sand watch its foot it be actually function as a paddle even though it be interact with a surface that we normally think of as a solid this be not different from what my former undergraduate discover when she figure out how lizard can run on water itself can you use this to make a good robot Martin Buehler do who be now at Boston Dynamics he take this idea and make RHex to be Aqua RHex so here be rhex with paddle now convert into a incredibly maneuverable swimming robot for rough surface though animal add claw and you probably feel they if you grab it do you touch it can I do RF and they do really well at grab onto surface with this claw Mark Cutkosky at Stanford University one of my collaborator be a extraordinary engineer who develop this technique call shape deposition Manufacturing where he can imbed claw right into a artificial foot and here be the simple version of a foot for a new robot that I will show you in a bit so to we blueprint let attach claw now if we look at animal though to be really maneuverable in all surface the animal use hybrid mechanism that include claw and spine and hair and pad and glue and capillary adhesion and a whole bunch of other thing this be all from different insect there be a ant crawl up a vertical surface let look at that ant this be the foot of a ant you see the hair and the claw and this thing here this be when its foot in the air watch what happen when the foot go onto you sandwich you see what happen that pad come out and that be where the glue be here from underneath be a ant foot and when the claw do not dig in that pad automatically come out without the ant do anything it just extrude and this be a hard shot to get I think this be the shot of the ant foot on the superstring so it be pretty tough to do this be what it look like close up here be the ant foot and there be the glue and we discover this glue may be a interesting two phase mixture it certainly help it to hold on so to we blueprint we stick on some sticky pad now you might think for smooth surface we get inspiration here now we have something good here the gecko a really great example of nanotechnology in nature this be its foot they be almost look alien and the secret which they stick on with involve they hairy toe they can run up a surface at a meter per second take 30 step in that one second you can hardly see they if we slow it down they attach they foot at eight millisecond and detach they in 16 millisecond and when you watch how they detach it it be bizarre they peel away from the surface like you have peel away a piece of tape very strange how do they stick if you look at they foot they have leaf like structure call linala with million of hair and each hair have the bad case of split end possible it have a hundred to a thousand split end and that be the secret because it allow intimate contact the gecko have a billion of this 200 nanometer sized split end and they do not stick by glue or they do not work like Velcro or they do not work with suction we discover they work by intermolecular force alone so to we blueprint we split some hair this have inspire the design of the first self clean dry adhesive the patent issue we be happy to say and here be the simple version in nature and here be my collaborator Ron Fearing attempt at a artificial version of this dry adhesive make from polyurethane and here be the first attempt to have it work on some load there be enormous interest in this in a variety of different field you could think of a thousand possible use I be sure lot of person have and we be excited about realize this as a product we have imagine product for example this one we imagine a bio inspire Band Aid where we take the glue off the Band Aid we take some hair from a molting gecko put three roll of they on here and then make this Band Aid this be a undergraduate volunteer we have 30 000 undergraduate so we can choose among they that be actually just a red pen mark but it make a incredible Band Aid it be aerate it can be peel off easily it do not cause any irritation it work underwater I think this be a extraordinary example of how curiosity base research we just wonder how they climb up something can lead to thing that you could never imagine it be just a example of why we need to support curiosity base research here you be pull off the Band Aid so we have redefine now what a foot be the question be can we use this secret then to inspire the design of a good foot good than one that we see in nature here be the new project we be try to create the first climbing search and rescue robot no suction or magnet that can only move on limited kind of surface I call the new robot rise for Robot in Scansorial Environment that be a climbing environment and we have a extraordinary team of biologist and engineer create this robot and here be RiSE it be six legged and have a tail here it be on a fence and a tree and here be RiSE first step on a incline you have the audio you can hear it go up and here it be come up at you in its first step up a wall now it be only use its simple foot here so this be very new but we think we get the dynamics right of the robot Mark Cutkosky though be take it a step far he be the one able to build this shape deposition manufacture foot and toe the next step be to make compliant toe and try to add spine and claw and set it for dry adhesive so the idea be to first get the toe and a foot right attempt to make that climb and ultimately put it on the robot and that be exactly what he be do he be build in fact a climbing foot bot inspire by nature and here be Cutkosky and he amazing student design so this be tune toe there be six of they and they use the principle that I just talk about collectively for the blueprint so this be not use any suction any glue and it will ultimately when it be attach to the robot it be as biologically inspire as the animal hopefully be able to climb any kind of a surface here you see it next go up the side of a building at Stanford it be speed up again it be a foot climb it be not the whole robot yet we be work on it now you can see how it be attach this tune structure allow the spine friction pad and ultimately the adhesive hair to grab onto very challenging difficult surface and so they be able to get this thing this be now speed up 20 time can you imagine it try to go up and rescue somebody at that upper floor ok you can visualize this now it be not impossible it be a very challenging task but more to come late to finish we have get design secret from nature by look at how foot be build we have learn we should distribute control to smart part do not put it all in the brain but put some of the control in tuned foot leg and even body that nature use hybrid solution not a single solution to this problem and they be integrate and beautifully robust and third we believe strongly that we do not want to mimic nature but instead be inspire by biology and use this novel principle with the good engineering solution that be out there to make potentially something good than nature so there be a clear message whether you care about a fundamental basic research of really interesting bizarre wonderful animal or you want to build a search and rescue robot that can help you in a earthquake or to save someone in a fire or you care about medicine we must preserve nature design otherwise this secret will be lose forever thank you
