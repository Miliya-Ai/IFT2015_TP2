what I would like to start off with be a observation which be that if I have learn anything over the last year it be that the supreme irony of publish a book about slowness be that you have to go around promote it really fast I seem to spend most of my time this day zip from city to city studio to studio interview to interview serve up the book in really tiny bite size chunk because everyone this day want to know how to slow down but they want to know how to slow down really quickly so so I do a spot on CNN the other day where I actually spend more time in makeup than I do talk on air and I think that that be not really surprising though be it because that be kind of the world that we live in now a world stick in fast forward a world obsess with speed with do everything fast with cram more and more into less and less time every moment of the day feel like a race against the clock to borrow a phrase from Carrie Fisher which be in my bio there I will just toss it out again this day even instant gratification take too long laughter and if you think about how we to try to make thing well what do we do no we speed they up do not we so we use to dial now we speed dial we use to read now we speed read we use to walk now we speed walk and of course we use to date and now we speed date and even thing that be by they very nature slow we try and speed they up too so I be in New York recently and I walk past a gym that have a advertisement in the window for a new course a new evening course and it be for you guess it speed yoga so this the perfect solution for time starve professional who want to you know salute the sun but only want to give over about 20 minute to it I mean this be sort of the extreme example and they be amusing and good to laugh at but there be a very serious point and I think that in the headlong dash of daily life we often lose sight of the damage that this roadrunner form of living do to we we be so marinated in the culture of speed that we almost fail to notice the toll it take on every aspect of we life on we health we diet we work we relationship the environment and we community and sometimes it take a wake up call do not it to alert we to the fact that we be hurry through we life instead of actually live they that we be live the fast life instead of the good life and I think for many person that wake up call take the form of a illness you know a burnout or eventually the body say I can not take it anymore and throw in the towel or maybe a relationship go up in smoke because we have not have the time or the patience or the tranquility to be with the other person to listen to they and my wake up call come when I start read bedtime story to my son and I find that at the end of day I would go into he room and I just could not slow down you know I would be speed reading the cat in the hat I would be you know I would be skip line here paragraph there sometimes a whole page and of course my little boy know the book inside out so we would quarrel and what should have be the most relax the most intimate the most tender moment of the day when a dad sit down to read to he son become instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of will a clash between my speed and he slowness and this go on for some time until I catch myself scan a newspaper article with timesaving tip for fast person and one of they make reference to a series of book call the one Minute Bedtime Story and I wince say that word now but my first reaction at the time be very different my first reflex be to say Hallelujah what a great idea this be exactly what I be look for to speed up bedtime even more but thankfully a light bulb go on over my head and my next reaction be very different and I take a step back and I think whoa you know have it really come to this be I really in such a hurry that I be prepared to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day and I put away the newspaper and I be get on a plane and I sit there and I do something I have not do for a long time which be I do nothing I just think and I think long and hard and by the time I get off that plane I have decide I want to do something about it I want to investigate this whole roadrunner culture and what it be do to I and to everyone else and I have two question in my head the first be how do we get so fast and the second be be it possible or even desirable to slow down now if you think about how we world get so accelerate the usual suspect rear they head you think of you know urbanization consumerism the workplace technology but I think if you cut through that force you get to what might be the deep driver the nub of the question which be how we think about time itself in other culture time be cyclical it be see as move in great unhurried circle it be always renew and refresh itself whereas in the west time be linear it be a finite resource it be always drain away you either use it or lose it Time be money as Benjamin Franklin say and I think what that do to we psychologically be it create a equation time be scarce so what do we do well well we speed up do not we we try and do more and more with less and less time we turn every moment of every day into a race to the finish line a finish line incidentally that we never reach but a finish line nonetheless and I guess that the question be be it possible to break free from that mindset and thankfully the answer be yes because what I discover when I begin look around that there be a global backlash against this culture that tell we that fast be always good and that busy be good right across the world person be do the unthinkable they be slow down and find that although conventional wisdom tell you that if you slow down you be road kill the opposite turn out to be true that by slow down at the right moment person find that they do everything good they eat good they make love good they exercise good they work well they live well and in this kind of cauldron of moment and place and act of deceleration lie what a lot of person now refer to as the international slow Movement now if you will permit I a small act of hypocrisy I will just give you a very quick overview of what be go on inside the slow Movement if you think of food many of you will have hear of the slow food movement start in Italy but have spread across the world and now have 100 000 member in 50 country and it be drive by a very simple and sensible message which be that we get more pleasure and more health from we food when we cultivate cook and consume it at a reasonable pace I think also the explosion of the organic farming movement and the renaissance of farmer market be other illustration of the fact that person be desperate to get away from eat and cook and cultivate they food on a industrial timetable they want to get back to slow rhythm and out of the slow food movement have grow something call the slow city movement which have start in Italy but have spread right across Europe and beyond and in this town begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape so that person be encourage to slow down and smell the rose and connect with one another so they might curb traffic or put in a park bench or some green space and in some way this change add up to more than the sum of they part because I think when a slow city become officially a slow city it be kind of like a philosophical declaration it be say to the rest of world and to the person in that town that we believe that in the 21st century slowness have a role to play in medicine I think a lot of person be deeply disillusion with the kind of quick fix mentality you find in conventional medicine and million of they around the world be turn to complementary and alternative form of medicine which tend to tap into sort of slow gentle more holistic form of healing now obviously the jury be out on many of this complementary therapy and I personally doubt that the coffee enema will ever you know gain mainstream approval but other treatment such as acupuncture and massage and even just relaxation clearly have some kind of benefit and blue chip medical college everywhere be start to study this thing to find out how they work and what we might learn from they sex there be a awful lot of fast sex around be not there I be come to well no pun intend there I be make my way let say slowly to Oxford and I go through a news agent and I see a magazine a man magazine and it say on the front how to bring you partner to orgasm in 30 second so you know even sex be on a stopwatch this day now you know I like a quickie as much as the next person but I think that there be a awful lot to be gain from slow sex from slow down in the bedroom you know you tap into that that deep sort of psychological emotional spiritual current and you get a good orgasm with the buildup you can get more bang for you buck let say I mean the Pointer Sisters say it most eloquently do not they when they sing the praise of a lover with a slow hand now we all laugh at Sting a few year ago when he go tantric but you fast forward a few year and now you find couple of all age flock to workshop or maybe just on they own in they own bedroom find way to put on the brake and have good sex and of course in Italy where I mean Italian always seem to know where to find they pleasure they have launch a official slow sex movement the workplace right across much of the world North America be a notable exception work hour have be come down and Europe be a example of that and person find that they quality of life improve as they be work less and also that they hourly productivity go up now clearly there be problem with the 35 hour workweek in France too much too soon too rigid but other country in Europe notably the Nordic country be show that it be possible to have a kick ass economy without be a workaholic and Norway Sweden Denmark and Finland now rank among the top six most competitive nation on Earth and they work the kind of hour that would make the average American weep with envy and if you go beyond sort of the country level down at the micro company level more and more company now be realize that they need to allow they staff either to work few hour or just to unplug to take a lunch break or to go sit in a quiet room to switch off they blackberry and laptop you at the back mobile phone during the work day or on the weekend so that they have time to recharge and for the brain to slide into that kind of creative mode of thought it be not just though this day adult who overwork though be it it be child too I be 37 and my childhood end in the mid 80 and I look at kid now and I be just amazed by the way they race around with more homework more tutoring more extracurricular than we would ever have conceive of a generation ago and some of the most heartrending email that I get on my website be actually from adolescent hover on the edge of burnout plead with I to write to they parent to help they slow down to help they get off this full throttle treadmill but thankfully there be a backlash there in parenting as well and you be find that you know town in the United States be now band together and ban extracurricular on a particular day of the month so that person can you know decompress and have some family time and slow down Homework be another thing there be homework ban spring up all over the developed world in school which have be pile on the homework for year and now they be discover that less can be more so there be a case up in Scotland recently where a fee pay high achieve private school ban homework for everyone under the age of 13 and the high achieve parent freak out and say what be you you know we kid will fall the headmaster say no no you child need to slow down at the end of the day and just this last month the exam result come in and in math science mark go up 20 percent on average last year and I think what be very revealing be that the elite university who be often cite as the reason that person drive they kid and hothouse they so much be start to notice the caliber of student come to they be fall this kid have wonderful mark they have cv jam with extracurricular to the point that would make you eye water but they lack spark they lack the ability to think creatively and think outside they do not know how to dream and so what this Ivy League school and Oxford and Cambridge and so on be start to send a message to parent and student that they need to put on the brake a little bit and in Harvard for instance they send out a letter to undergraduate freshman tell they that they will get more out of life and more out of Harvard if they put on the brake if they do less but give time to thing the time that thing need to enjoy they to savor they and even if they sometimes do nothing at all and that letter be call very revealing I think slow down with a exclamation mark on the end so wherever you look the message it seem to I be the same that less be very often more that slow be very often well but that say of course it be not that easy to slow down be it I mean you hear that I get a speeding ticket while I be research my book on the benefit of slowness and that be true but that be not all of it I be actually en route to a dinner hold by slow food at the time and if that be not shame enough I get that ticket in Italy and if any of you have ever drive on a Italian highway you will have a pretty good idea of how fast I be go laughter but why be it so hard to slow down I think there be various reason one be that speed be fun you know speed be sexy it be all that adrenaline rush it be hard to give it up I think there be a kind of metaphysical dimension that speed become a way of wall ourselves off from the big deep question we fill we head with distraction with busyness so that we do not have to ask am I well be I happy be my child grow up right be politician make good decision on my behalf another reason although I think perhaps the most powerful reason why we find it hard to slow down be the cultural taboo that we have erect against slow down slow be a dirty word in we culture it be a byword for lazy slacker for be somebody who give up you know he be a bit slow it be actually synonymous with be stupid I guess what the slow Movement the purpose of the slow Movement or its main goal really be to tackle that taboo and to say that yes sometimes slow be not the answer that there be such a thing as bad slow you know I get stick on the m25 which be a ring road around London recently and spend three and a half hour there and I can tell you that be really bad slow but the new idea the sort of revolutionary idea of the slow Movement be that there be such a thing as good slow too and good slow be you know take the time to eat a meal with you family with the tv switch off or take the time to look at a problem from all angle in the office to make the good decision at work or even simply just take the time to slow down and savor you life now one of the thing that I find most uplifting about all of this stuff that be happen around the book since it come out be the reaction to it and I know that when my book on slowness come out it would be welcome by the New Age brigade but it be also be take up with great gusto by the corporate world you know business press but also big company and leadership organization because person at the top of the chain person like you I think be start to realize that there be too much speed in the system there be too much busyness and it be time to find or get back to that lost art of shift gear another encouraging sign I think be that it be not just in the developed world that this idea be take up in the develop world in country that be on the verge of make that leap into first world status China Brazil Thailand Poland and so on this country have embrace the idea of the slow Movement many person in they and there be a debate go on in they media on the street because I think they be look at the West and they be say well we like that aspect of what you have get but we be not so sure about that so all of that say be it I guess be it possible that be really the main question before we today be it possible to slow down and I be happy to be able to say to you that the answer be a resounding yes and I present myself as exhibit a a kind of reform and rehabilitate speed aholic I still love speed you know I live in London and I work as a journalist and I enjoy the buzz and the busyness and the adrenaline rush that come from both of that thing I play squash and ice hockey two very fast sport and I would not give they up for the world but I have also over the last year or so get in touch with my inner tortoise laughter and what that mean be that I no long overload myself gratuitously my default mode be no long to be a rush aholic I no long hear time winged chariot drawing near or at least not as much as I do before I can actually hear it now because I see my time be tick off and the upshot of all of that be that I actually feel a lot happy healthy more productive than I ever have I feel like I be live my life rather than actually just race through it and perhaps the most important measure of the success of this be that I feel that my relationship be a lot deep rich strong and for I I guess the litmus test for whether this would work and what it would mean be always go to be bedtime story because that be sort of where the journey begin and there too the news be rosy you know at the end of the day I go into my son room I do not wear a watch I switch off my computer so I can not hear the email ping into the basket and I just slow down to he pace and we read and because child have they own tempo and internal clock they do not do quality time where you schedule 10 minute for they to open up to you they need you to move at they rhythm I find that 10 minute into a story you know my son will suddenly say you know something happen in the playground today that really bother I and we will go off and have a conversation on that and I now find that bedtime story use to be a box on my to do list something that I dread because it be so slow and I have to get through it quickly it be become my reward at the end of the day something I really cherish and I have a kind of Hollywood end to my talk this afternoon which go a little bit like this a few month ago I be get ready to go on another book tour and I have my bag pack I be downstairs by the front door and I be wait for a taxi and my son come down the stair and he would make a card for I and he be carry it he have go and staple two card very like this together and put a sticker of he favorite character Tintin on the front and he say to I or he hand this to I and I read it and it say to daddy love Benjamin and I think aw that be really sweet be that a good luck on the book tour card and he say no no no daddy this be a card for be the good story reader in the world and I think yeah you know this slow down thing really do work thank you very much
