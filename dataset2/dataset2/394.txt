I have be intrigue by this question of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense a sense that would give we seamless access and easy access to meta information or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help we make the right decision about whatever it be that we be come across and some of you may argue well do not today cell phone do that already but I would say no when you meet someone here at TED and this be the top networking place of course of the year you do not shake somebody hand and then say can you hold on for a moment while I take out my phone and Google you or when you go to the supermarket and you be stand there in that huge aisle of different type of toilet paper you do not take out you cell phone and open a browser and go to a website to try to decide which of this different toilet paper be the most ecologically responsible purchase to make so we do not really have easy access to all this relevant information that can just help we make optimal decision about what to do next and what action to take and so my research group at the media lab have be develop a series of invention to give we access to this information in a sort of easy way without require that the user change any of they behavior and I be here to unveil we late effort and most successful effort so far which be still very much a work in process I be actually wear the device right now and we have sort of cobble it together with component that be off the shelf and that by the way only cost 350 dollar at this point in time I be wear a camera just a simple web cam a portable battery power projection system with a little mirror this component communicate to my cell phone in my pocket which act as the communication and computation device and in the video here we see my student Pranav Mistry who be really the genius who be be implement and design this whole system and we see how this system let he walk up to any surface and start use he hand to interact with the information that be project in front of he the system track the four significant finger in this case he be wear simple marker cap that you may recognize but if you want a more stylish version you could also paint you nail in different color and the camera basically track this four finger and recognize any gesture that he be make so he can just go to for example a map of Long Beach zoom in and out etc the system also recognize iconic gesture such as the take a picture gesture and then take a picture of whatever be in front of you and when he then walk back to the Media Lab he can just go up to any wall and project all the picture that he be take sort through they and organize they and re size they etc again use all natural gesture so some of you most likely be here two year ago and see the demo by Jeff Han or some of you may think well do not this look like the Microsoft Surface table and yes you also interact use natural gesture both hand etc but the difference here be that you can use any surface you can walk up to any surface include you hand if nothing else be available and interact with this project datum the device be completely portable and can be applause applause end so one important difference be that it be totally mobile another even more important difference be that in mass production this would not cost more tomorrow than today cell phone and would actually not sort of be a big packaging could look a lot more stylish than this version that I be wear around my neck but other than let some of you live out you fantasy of look as cool as Tom Cruise in Minority Report the reason why we be really excited about this device be that it really can act as one of this sixth sense device that give you relevant information about whatever be in front of you so we see Pranav here go into the supermarket and he be shop for some paper towel and as he pick up a product the system can recognize the product that he be pick up use either image recognition or marker technology and give he the green light or a orange light he can ask for additional information so this particular choice here be a particularly good choice give he personal criterion some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically responsible choice laughter if he pick up a book in the bookstore he can get a Amazon rating it get project right on the cover of the book this be Juan book we previous speaker which get a great rating by the way at Amazon and so Pranav turn the page of the book and can then see additional information about the book reader comment maybe sort of information by he favorite critic etc if he turn to a particular page he find a annotation by maybe a expert or a friend of ours that give he a little bit of additional information about whatever be on that particular page read the newspaper it never have to be outdated laughter you can get video annotation of the event that you be read about you can get the late sport score etc this be a more controversial one laughter as you interact with someone at TED maybe you can see a word cloud of the tag the word that be associate with that person in they blog and personal web page in this case the student be interested in camera etc on you way to the airport if you pick up you board pass it can tell you that you flight be delay that the gate have change etc and if you need to know what the current time be it be as simple as draw a watch laughter applause on you arm so that be where we be at so far in develop this sixth sense that would give we seamless access to all this relevant information about the thing that we may come across my student Pranav who be really like I say the genius behind this applause and cheer applause end he do deserve a lot of applause because I do not think he be sleep much in the last three month actually and he girlfriend be probably not very happy about he either but it be not perfect yet it be very much a work in progress and who know maybe in another 10 year we will be here with the ultimate sixth sense brain implant thank you applause
