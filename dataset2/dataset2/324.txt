this be in a area call Wellawatta a prime residential area in Colombo we stand on the railroad track that run between my friend house and the beach the track be elevate about eight foot from the waterline normally but at that point the water have recede to a level three or four foot below normal I would never see the reef here before there be fish catch in rock pool leave behind by the recede water some child jump down and run to the rock pool with bag they be try to catch fish no one realize that this be a very bad idea the person on the track just continue to watch they I turn around to check on my friend house then someone on the track scream before I could turn around everyone on the track be scream and run the water have start come back it be foam over the reef the child manage to run back onto the track no one be lose there but the water continue to climb in about two minute it have reach the level of the railroad track and be come over it we have run about 100 meter by this time it continue to rise I see a old man stand at he gate knee deep in water refuse to move he say he have live he whole life there by the beach and that he would rather die there than run a boy break away from he mother to run back into he house to get he dog who be apparently afraid a old lady crying be carry out of she house and up the road by she son the slum build on the railroad reservation between the sea and the railroad track be completely sweep away since this be a high risk location the police have warn the resident and no one be there when the water rise but they have not have any time to evacuate any belongings for hour afterwards the sea be strew with bit of wood for mile around all of this be from the house in the slum when the water subside it be as if it have never exist this may seem hard to believe unless you have be read lot and lot of news report but in many place after the tsunami villager be still terrified when what be a tranquil sea swallow up person home and long tail boat mercilessly without warn and no one can tell you anything reliable about whether another one be come I be not sure you would want to calm down either one of the scary thing about the tsunami that I have not see mention be the complete lack of information this may seem minor but it be terrifying to hear rumor after rumor after rumor that another tidal wave big than the last will be come at exactly 1 p m or perhaps tonight or perhaps you do not even know if it be safe to go back down to the water to catch a boat to the hospital we think that Phi Phi hospital be destroy we think this boat be go to Phuket hospital but if it be too dangerous to land at its pier then perhaps it will go to Krabi instead which be more protected we do not think another wave be come right away at the Phi Phi Hill Resort I be tuck into the corner furth away from the television but I strain to listen for information they report that there be a 8 5 magnitude earthquake in Sumatra which trigger the massive tsunami have this news be comfort in some small way to understand what have just happen to we however the report focus on what have already occur and offer no information on what to expect now in general everything be merely hearsay and rumor and not a single person I speak to for over 36 hour know anything with any certainty that be two account of the Asian tsunami from two internet blog that essentially spring up after it occur I be now go to show you two video segment from the tsunami that also be show on blog I should warn you they be pretty powerful one from Thailand and the second one from Phuket as well scream Voice 1 it be come in it be come again Voice 2 it be come again Voice 1 yeah it be come again Voice 2 come get inside here Voice 1 it be come again Voice 2 New wave Voice 1 it be come again new wave unclear scream they call I out here James Surowiecki Phew that be both on this site waveofdestruction org in the world of blog there be go to be before the tsunami and after the tsunami because one of the thing that happen in the wake of the tsunami be that although initially that be in that first day there be actually a kind of dearth of live reporting there be a dearth of live video and some person complain about this they say the blogster let we down what become very clear be that within a few day the outpouring of information be immense and we get a complete and powerful picture of what have happen in a way that we never have be able to get before and what you have be a group of essentially unorganized unconnected writer video blogger etc who be able to come up with a collective portrait of a disaster that give we a much good sense of what it be like to actually be there than the mainstream media could give we and so in some way the tsunami can be see as a sort of seminal moment a moment in which the blogosphere come to a certain degree of age now I be go to move now from this kind of the sublime in the traditional sense of the word that be to say awe inspire terrifying to the somewhat more mundane because when we think about blog I think for most of we who be concerned about they we be primarily concern with thing like politics technology etc and I want to ask three question in this talk in the 10 minute that remain about the blogosphere the first one be what do it tell we about we idea about what motivate person to do thing the second be do blog genuinely have the possibility of access a kind of collective intelligence that have previously remain for the most part untapped and then the third part be what be the potential problem or the dark side of blog as we know they ok the first question what do they tell we about why person do thing one of the fascinating thing about the blogosphere specifically and of course the internet more generally and it be go to seem like a very obvious point but I think it be a important one to think about be that the person who be generate this enormous ream of content every day who be spend enormous amount of time organize link comment on the substance of the internet be do so primarily for free they be not get pay for it in any way other than in the attention and to some extent the reputational capital that they gain from do a good job and this be at least to a traditional economist somewhat remarkable because the traditional account of economic man would say that basically you do thing for a concrete reward primarily financial but instead what we be find on the internet and one of the great genius of it be that person have find a way to work together without any money involve at all they have come up with in a sense a different method for organize activity the Yale Law professor Yochai Benkler in a essay call Coase Penguin talk about this open source model which we be familiar with from Linux as be potentially applicable in a whole host of situation and you know if you think about this with the tsunami what you have be essentially a kind of a army of local journalist who be produce enormous amount of material for no reason other than to tell they story that be a very powerful idea and it be a very powerful reality and it be one that offer really interesting possibility for organize a whole host of activity down the road so I think the first thing that the blogosphere tell we be that we need to expand we idea of what count as rational and we need to expand we simple equation of value equal money or you have to pay for it to be good but that in fact you can end up with collectively really brilliant product without any money at all change hand there be a few blogger somewhere maybe around 20 now who do in fact make some kind of money and a few who be actually try to make a full time live out of it but the vast majority of they be do it because they love it or they love the attention or whatever it be so Howard Rheingold have write a lot about this and I think be write about this more but this notion of voluntary cooperation be a incredibly powerful one and one worth think about the second question be what do the blogosphere actually do for we in term of access collective intelligence you know as Chris mention I write a book call the wisdom of crowd and the premise of the wisdom of crowd be that under the right condition group can be remarkably intelligent and they can actually often be smart than even the smart person within they the simple example of this be if you ask a group of person to do something like guess how many jellybean be in a jar if I have a jar of jellybean and I ask you all to guess how many jellybean be in that jar you average guess would be remarkably good it would be somewhere probably within three and five percent of the number of bean in the jar and it would be good than 90 to 95 percent of you there may be one or two of you who be brilliant jelly bean guesser but for the most part the group guess would be good than just about all of you and what be fascinating be that you can see this phenomenon at work in many more complicated situation for instance if you look at the odds on horse at a racetrack they predict almost perfectly how likely a horse be to win in a sense the group of betters at the racetrack be forecast the future in probabilistic term you know if you think about something like Google which essentially be rely on the collective intelligence of the web to seek out that site that have the most valuable information we know that Google do a exceptionally good job of do that and it do that because collectively this disorganized thing we call the world wide web actually have a remarkable order or a remarkable intelligence in it and this I think be one of the real promise of the blogosphere Dan Gillmor whose book we the media be include in the gift pack have talk about it as say that as a writer he be recognize that he reader know more than he do and this be a very challenging idea it be a very challenging idea to mainstream media it be a very challenging idea to anyone who have invest a enormous amount of time and expertise and who have a lot of energy invest in the notion that he or she know good than everyone else but what the blogosphere offer be the possibility of get at the kind of collective distributive intelligence that be out there and that we know be available to we if we can just figure out a way of access it each blog post each blog commentary may not in and of itself be exactly what we be look for but collectively the judgment of that person post that person link more often than not be go to give you a very interesting and enormously valuable picture of what be go on so that be the positive side of it that be the positive side of what be sometimes call participatory journalism or citizen journalism etc that in fact we be give person who have never be able to talk before a voice and we be able to access information that have always be there but have essentially go untapped but there be a dark side to this and that be what I want to spend the last part of my talk on one of the thing that happen if you spend a lot of time on the internet and you spend a lot of time think about the internet be that it be very easy to fall in love with the internet it be very easy to fall in love with the decentralize bottom up structure of the internet it be very easy to think that network be necessarily good thing that be link from one place to another that be tightly link in a group be a very good thing and much of the time it be but there be also a downside to this a kind of dark side in fact and that be that the more tightly link we have become to each other the hard it be for each of we to remain independent one of the fundamental characteristic of a network be that once you be link in the network the network start to shape you view and start to shape you interaction with everybody else that be one of the thing that define what a network be a network be not just the product of its component part it be something more than that it be as Steven Johnson have talk about a emergent phenomenon now this have all this benefit it be very beneficial in term of the efficiency of communicate information it give you access to a whole host of person it allow person to coordinate they activity in very good way but the problem be that group be only smart when the person in they be as independent as possible this be the paradox of the wisdom of crowd or the paradox of collective intelligence that what it require be actually a form of independent thinking and network make it hard for person to do that because they drive attention to the thing that the network value so one of the phenomena that be very clear in the blogosphere be that once a meme once a idea get go it be very easy for person to just sort of pile on because other person have say a link person have link to it and so other person in turn link to it etc etc and that phenomenon of pile on the exist link be one that be characteristic of the blogosphere particularly of the political blogosphere and it be one that essentially throw off this beautiful decentralized bottom up intelligence that blog can manifest in the right condition the metaphor that I like to use be the metaphor of the circular mill a lot of person talk about ant you know this be a conference inspire by nature when we talk about bottom up decentralize phenomenon the ant colony be the classic metaphor because no individual ant know what it be do but collectively ant be able to reach incredibly intelligent decision they be able to reach food as efficiently as possible they be able to guide they traffic with remarkable speed so the ant colony be a great model you have all this little part that collectively add up to a great thing but we know that occasionally ant go astray and what happen be that if army ant be wander around and they get lose they start to follow a simple rule just do what the ant in front of you do and what happen be that the ant eventually end up in a circle and there be this famous example of one that be 1 200 foot long and last for two day and the ant just keep march around and around in a circle until they die and that I think be a sort of thing to watch out for that be the thing we have to fear be that we be just go to keep march around and around until we die now I want to connect this back though to the tsunami because one of the great thing about the tsunami in term of the blogosphere coverage not in term of the tsunami itself be that it really do represent a genuine bottom up phenomenon you see site that have never exist before get huge amount of traffic you see person be able to offer up they independent point of view in a way that they have not before there you really do see the intelligence of the web manifest itself so that be the upside the circular mill be the downside and I think that the former be what we really need to strive for thank you very much applause
