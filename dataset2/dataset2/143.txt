the advance that have take place in astronomy cosmology and biology in the last 10 year be really extraordinary to the point where we know more about we universe and how it work than many of you might imagine but there be something else that I have notice as that change be take place as person be start to find out that hmm yeah there really be a black hole at the center of every galaxy the science writer and editor I should not say science writer I should say person who write about science and editor would sit down over a couple of beer after a hard day of work and start talk about some of this incredible perception about how the universe work and they would inevitably end up in what I think be a very bizarre place which be way the world could end very suddenly and that be what I want to talk about today laughter ah you laugh you fool laughter Voice can we finish up a little early laughter yeah we need the time Stephen Petranek at first it all seem a little fantastical to I but after challenge a lot of this idea I begin to take a lot of they seriously and then September 11 happen and I think ah God I can not go to the TED conference and talk about how the world be go to end nobody want to hear that not after this and that get I into a discussion with some other person other scientist about maybe some other subject and one of the guy I talk to who be a neuroscientist say you know I think there be a lot of solution to the problem you bring up and remind I of Michael talk yesterday and he mother say you can not have a solution if you do not have a problem so we go out look for solution to way that the world might end tomorrow and lo and behold we find they which lead I to a videotape of a President Bush press conference from a couple of week ago can we run that Andrew President George W Bush whatever it cost to defend we security and whatever it cost to defend we freedom we must pay it sp I agree with the president he want two trillion dollar to protect we from terrorist next year a two trillion dollar federal budget which will land we back into deficit spending real fast but terrorist be not the only threat we face there be really serious calamity stare we in the eye that we be in the same kind of denial about that we be about terrorism and what could have happen on September 11 I would propose therefore that if we take 10 billion dollar from that 2 13 trillion dollar budget which be two one hundredth of that budget and we dole out a billion dollar to each one of this problem I be go to talk to you about the vast majority could be solve and the rest we could deal with so I hope you find this both fascinating I be fascinate by this kind of stuff I get ta admit to I this be Richard cockroach but I also hope because I think the person in this room can literally change the world I hope you take some of this stuff away with you and when you have a opportunity to be influential that you try to get some heavy duty money spend on some of this idea so let start number 10 we lose the will to survive we live in a incredible age of modern medicine we be all much healthy than we be 20 year ago person around the world be get good medicine but mentally we be fall apart the World Health Organization now estimate that one out of five person on the planet be clinically depressed and the World Health Organization also say that depression be the big epidemic that humankind have ever face soon genetic breakthrough and even good medicine be go to allow we to think of 100 as a normal lifespan a female child bear tomorrow on average median will live to age 83 we life longevity be go up almost a year for every year that pass now the problem with all of this get old be that person over 65 be the most likely person to commit suicide so what be the solution we do not really have mental health insurance in this country and it be applause it be really a crime something like 98 percent of all person with depression and I mean really severe depression I have a friend with stunningly severe depression this be a curable disease with present medicine and present technology but it be often a combination of talk therapy and pill pill alone do not do it especially in clinically depressed person you ought to be able to go to a psychiatrist or a psychologist and put down you 10 dollar copay and get treat just like you do when you get a cut on you arm it be ridiculous secondly drug company be not go to develop really sophisticated psychoactive drug we know that most mental illness have a biological component that can be deal with and we know just a amazing amount more about the brain now than we do 10 year ago we need a pump push from the federal government through NIH and National Science NSF and place like that to start help the drug company develop some advanced psychoactive drug move on number nine do not laugh alien invade Earth ten year ago you could not have find a astronomer well very few astronomer in the world who would have tell you that there be any planet anywhere outside we solar system 1995 we find three the count now be up to 80 we be find about two or three a month all of the one we have find by the way be in this little teeny tiny corner where we live in the Milky Way there must be million of planet in the Milky Way and as Carl Sagan insist for many year and be laugh at for it there must be billion and billion in the universe in a few year NASA be go to launch four or five telescope out to Jupiter where there be less dust and start look for Earth like planet which we can not see with present technology nor detect it be become obvious that the chance that life do not exist elsewhere in the universe and probably fairly close to we be a fairly remote idea and the chance that some of it be not more intelligent than ours be also a remote idea remember we have only be a advanced civilization a industrial civilization if you would for 200 year although every time I go to Pompeii I be amazed that they have the equivalent of a McDonald on every street corner too so I do not know how much civilization really have progress since ad 79 but there be a great likelihood I really believe this and I do not believe in alien and I do not believe there be any alien on the Earth or anything like that but there be a likelihood that we will confront a civilization that be more intelligent than we own now what will happen what if they come to you know suck up we ocean for the hydrogen and swat we away like fly the way we swat away fly when we go into the rainforest and start log it we can look at we own history the late physicist Gerard O Neill say Advanced Western civilization have have a destructive effect on all primitive civilization it have come in contact with even in that case where every attempt be make to protect and guard the primitive civilization if the alien come visit we be the primitive civilization so what be the solution to this laughter thank God you can all read it may seem ridiculous but we have a really lousy history of anticipate thing like this and actually be prepare for they how much energy and money do it take to actually have a plan to negotiate with a advanced species secondly and you be go to hear more from I about this we have to become a outward look space fare nation we have get to develop the idea that the Earth do not last forever we sun do not last forever if we want humanity to last forever we have to colonize the Milky Way and that be not something that be beyond comprehension at this point applause it will also help we a lot if we meet a advanced civilization along the way if we be try to be a advanced civilization number eight Voice Steve that be what I be do after TED laughter applause sp you have get it you have get the job number eight the ecosystem collapse last July in Science the journal Science 19 oceanographer publish a very very unusual article it be not really a research report it be a screed they say we have be look at the ocean for a long time now and we want to tell you they be not in trouble they be near collapse many other ecosystem on Earth be in real real danger we be live in a time of mass extinction that exceed the fossil record by a factor of 10 000 we have lose 25 percent of the unique species in Hawaii in the last 20 year California be expect to lose 25 percent of its species in the next 40 year somewhere in the Amazon forest be the marginal tree you cut down that tree the rain forest collapse as a ecosystem there be really a tree like that out there that be really what it come to and when that ecosystem collapse it could take a major ecosystem with it like we atmosphere so what do we do about this what be the solution there be some modeling of ecosystem go on now the problem with ecosystem be that we understand they so poorly that we do not know they be really in trouble until it be almost too late we need to know early that they be get in trouble and we need to be able to pump possible solution into model and with the kind of compute power we have now there be as I say some of this go on but it need money National Science Foundation need to say you know almost all the money that be spend on science in this country come from the federal government one way or another and they get to prioritize you know there be person at the National Science Foundation who get to say this be the most important thing this be one of the thing they ought to be think more about secondly we need to create huge biodiversity reserve on the planet and start move they around there be be a experiment for the last four or five year on the Georges Bank or the Grand Banks off of Newfoundland it be a no take fishing zone they can not fish there for a radius of 200 mile and a amazing thing have happen almost all the fish have come back and they be reproduce like crazy we be go to have to start do this around the globe we be go to have to have no take zone we be go to have to say no more log in the Amazon for 20 year let it recover before we start log again applause number seven particle accelerator mishap you all remember Ted Kaczynski the Unabomber one of the thing he rave about be that a particle accelerator experiment could go haywire and set off a chain reaction that would destroy the world a lot of very sober minded physicist believe it or not have have exactly the same thought this spring there be a collider at Brookhaven on Long Island this spring it be go to have a experiment in which it create black hole they be expect to create little tiny black hole they expect they to evaporate laughter I hope they be right laughter other collider experiment there be one that be go to take place next summer at CERN have the possibility of create something call strangelet which be kind of like antimatter whenever they hit other matter they destroy it and obliterate it most physicist say that the accelerator we have now be not really powerful enough to create black hole and strangelet that we need to worry about and they be probably right but all around the world in Japan in Canada there be talk about this of revive this in the United States we shut one down that be go to be big but there be talk of build very big accelerator what can we do about this what be the solution we have get the fox watch the henhouse here we need to we need the advice of particle physicist to talk about particle physics and what should be do in particle physics but we need some outside thinking and watchdogging of what be go on with this experiment secondly we have a natural laboratory surround the Earth we have a electromagnetic field around the Earth and it be constantly bombard by high energy particle like proton and in my opinion we do not spend enough time look at that natural laboratory and figure out first what be safe to do on Earth Number six biotech disaster it be one of my favorite one because we have do several story on Bt corn Bt corn be a corn that create its own pesticide to kill a corn borer you may of hear of it hear it call StarLink especially when all that taco shell be take out of the supermarket about a year and a half ago this stuff be suppose to only be feed for animal in the United States and it get into the human food supply and somebody should have figure out that it would get in the human food supply very easily but the thing that be alarming be a couple of month ago in Mexico where Bt corn and all genetically alter corn be totally illegal they find Bt corn gene in wild corn plant now corn originate we think in Mexico this be the genetic biodiversity storehouse of corn this bring back a skepticism that have go away recently that superweed and superpest could spread around the world from biotechnology that literally could destroy the world food supply in very short order so what do we do about that we treat biotechnology with the same scrutiny we apply to nuclear power plant it be that simple this be a amazingly unregulated field when the StarLink disaster happen there be a battle between the EPA and the FDA over who really have authority and over what part of this and they do not get it straighten out for month that be kind of crazy number five one of my favorite reversal of the Earth magnetic field believe it or not this happen every few hundred thousand year and have happen many time in we history North Pole go to the South South Pole go to the North and vice versa but what happen as this occur be that we lose we magnetic field around the Earth over the period of about 100 year and that mean that all this cosmic ray and particle that be to come streaming at we from the sun that this field protect we from be well basically we be go to fry laughter Voice Steve I have some additional hat downstairs sp so what can we do about this oh by the way we be overdue it be be 780 000 year since this happen so it should have happen about 480 000 year ago oh and here be one other thing scientist think now we magnetic field may be diminish by about five percent so maybe we be in the throe of it one of the problem of try to figure out how healthy the Earth be be that we have you know we do not have good weather datum from 60 year ago much less datum on thing like the ozone layer so there be a fairly simple solution to this there be go to be a lot of cheap rocketry that be go to come online in about six or seven year that get we into the low atmosphere very cheaply you know we can make ozone from car tailpipe it be not hard it be just three oxygen atom if you bring the entire ozone layer down to the surface of the Earth it would be the thickness of two penny at 14 pound per square inch you do not need that much up there we need to learn how to repair and replenish the Earth ozone layer applause number four giant solar flare solar flare be enormous magnetic outburst from the Sun that bombard the Earth with high speed subatomic particle so far we atmosphere have do and we magnetic field have do pretty well protect we from this occasionally we get a flare from the Sun that cause havoc with communication and so forth and electricity but the alarming thing be that astronomer recently have be study star that be similar to we Sun and they have find that a number of they when they be about the age of we Sun brighten by a factor of as much as 20 do not last for very long and they think this be super flare million of time more powerful than any flare we have have from we Sun so far obviously we do not want one of that laughter there be a flip side to it in study star like we Sun we have find that they go through period of diminishment when they total amount of energy that be expel from they go down by maybe one percent one percent do not sound like a lot but it would cause one hell of a ice age here so what can we do about this laughter start terraform Mars this be one of my favorite subject I write a story about this in Life magazine in 1993 this be rocket science but it be not hard rocket science everything that we need to make a atmosphere on Mars and to make a livable planet on Mars be probably there and you just literally have to send little nuclear factory up there that gobble up the iron oxide on the surface of Mars and spit out the oxygen the problem be it take 300 year to terraform Mars minimum really more like 500 year to do it right there be no reason why we should not start now laughter number three be not this stuff cool laughter a new global epidemic person have be at war with germ ever since there have be person and from time to time the germ sure get the upper hand in 1918 we have a flu epidemic in the United States that kill 20 million person that be back when the population be around 100 million person the bubonic plague in Europe in the Middle Ages kill one out of four European AIDS be come back Ebola seem to be rear its head with much too much frequency and old disease like cholera be become resistant to antibiotic we have all learn what the kind of panic that can occur when a old disease rear its head like anthrax the bad possibility be that a very simple germ like staph for which we have one antibiotic that still work mutate and we know staph can do amazing thing a staph cell can be next to a muscle cell in you body and borrow gene from it when antibiotic come and change and mutate the danger be that some germ like staph will be will mutate into something that be really virulent very contagious and will sweep through population before we can do anything about it that be happen before about 12 000 year ago there be a massive wave of mammal extinction in the Americas and that be think to have be a virulent disease so what can we do about it it be nuts we give antibiotic applause every cow every lamb every chicken they get antibiotic every day all you know you go to a restaurant you eat fish I get news for you it be all farmed you know you get ta ask when you go to a restaurant if it be a wild fish cause they be not go to tell you we be give away the code this be like be at war and give somebody you secret code we be tell the germ out there how to fight we we get ta fix that we get ta outlaw that right away secondly we public health system as we see with anthrax be a real disaster we have a real major outbreak of disease in the United States we be not prepare to cope with it now there be money in the federal budget next year to build up the public health service but I do not think to any extent that it really need to be do number two my favorite we meet a rogue black hole you know 10 year ago or 15 year ago really you walk into a astronomy convention and you say you know there be probably a black hole at the center of every galaxy and they be go to hoot you off the stage and now if you go into one of that convention and you say well I do not think black hole be out there they have hoot you off the stage we comprehension of the way the universe work be really have just gain unbelievably in recent year we think that there be about 10 million dead star in the Milky Way alone we galaxy and this star have compress down to maybe something like 12 15 mile wide and they be black hole and they be gobble up everything around they include light which be why we can not see they most of they should be in orbit around something but galaxy be very violent place and thing can be spin out of orbit and also space be incredibly vast so even if you fling a million of this thing out of orbit the chance that one would actually hit we be fairly remote but it only have to get close about a billion mile away one of this thing about a billion mile away here be what happen to Earth orbit it become elliptical instead of circular and for three month out of the year the surface temperature go up to 150 to 180 for three month out of the year they go to 50 below zero that will not work too well what can we do about this and this be my scary laughter I do not have a good answer for this one again we get ta think about be a colonize race and finally number one big danger to life as we know it I think a really big asteroid head for Earth the important thing to remember here this be not a question of if this be a question of when and how big in 1908 just a 200 foot piece of a comet explode over Siberia and flatten forest for maybe 100 mile it have the effect of about 1 000 Hiroshima bomb astronomer estimate that little asteroid like that come about every hundred year in 1989 a large asteroid pass 400 000 mile away from Earth nothing to worry about right it pass directly through Earth orbit we be in that that spot six hour early a small asteroid say a half mile wide would touch off firestorm follow by severe global cooling from the debris kick up Carl Sagan nuclear winter thing a asteroid five mile wide cause major extinction we think the one that get the dinosaur be about five mile wide where be they there be something call the Kuiper belt which some person think Pluto not a planet that be where Pluto be it be in the Kuiper belt there be also something a little far out call the oort cloud there be about 100 000 ball of ice and rock comet really out there that be 50 mile in diameter or more and they regularly take a little spin in towards the Sun and pass reasonably close to we of more concern I think be the asteroid that exist between Mars and Jupiter the folk at the Sloan Digital Sky Survey tell we last fall they be make the first map of the universe three dimensional map of the universe that there be probably 700 000 asteroid between Mars and Jupiter that be a half a mile big or big so you say yeah well what be really the chance of this happen Andrew can you put that chart up this be a chart that Dr Clark Chapman at the Southwest Research Institute present to Congress a few year ago you will notice that the chance of a asteroid slash comet impact kill you be about one in 20 000 accord to the work they have do now look at the one right below that passenger aircraft crash one in 20 000 we spend a awful lot of money try to be sure that we do not die in airplane accident and we be not spend hardly anything on this and yet this be completely preventable we finally have just in the last year the technology to stop this cold could we have the solution NASA spending three million dollar a year three million buck that be like pocket change to search for asteroid because we can actually figure out every asteroid that be out there and if it might hit Earth and when it might hit Earth and they be try to do that but it be go to take they 10 year at spend three million dollar a year and even then they claim they will only have about 80 percent of they catalogue Comets be a tough act we do not really have the technology to predict comet trajectory or when one with we name on it might arrive but we would have lot of time if we see it come we really need a dedicated observatory you will notice that a lot of comet be name after person you never hear of amateur astronomer that be because nobody be look for they except amateur we need a dedicated observatory that look for comet Part two of the solution we need to figure out how to blow up a asteroid or alter its trajectory now a year ago we do a amazing thing we send a probe out to this asteroid belt call NEAR Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous and this guy orbit a 30 or no about a 22 mile long asteroid call Eros and then of course you know they pull one of that sneaky NASA thing where they have extra battery and extra gas aboard and everything and then at the last minute they land when the mission be over they actually land on the thing we have land a rocket ship on a asteroid it be not a big deal now the trouble with just send a bomb out for this thing be that you do not have anything to push against in space because there be no air a nuclear explosion be just as hot but we do not really have anything big enough to melt a 22 mile long asteroid or vaporize it would be more like it but we can learn to land on this asteroid that have we name on they and put something like a small ion propulsion motor on it which would gently slowly after a period of time push it into a different trajectory which if we have do we math right would keep it from hit Earth this be just a matter of find em go there and do something about it I know you head be spin from all this stuff yikes so many big threat the thing I think to remember be September 11 we do not want to get catch flat footed again we know about this stuff Science have the power to predict the future in many case now Knowledge be power the bad thing we can do be say jeez I get enough to worry about without worry about a asteroid laughter that be a mistake that could literally cost we we future thank you
