I go to Spain a few month ago and I have the good foie gras of my life the good culinary experience of my life because what I see I be convince be the future of cook ridiculous right Foie gras and the future of cook there be not a food today that be more maligned than foie gras right I mean it be crucify it be outlaw in Chicago for a while it be pend here in California and just recently in New York it be like if you be a chef and you put it on you menu you risk be attack really it happen here in San Francisco to a famous chef I be not say that there be not a rationale for be oppose to foie gras the reason usually just boil down to the gavage which be the force feed basically you take a goose or a duck and you force feed a ton of grain down its throat more grain in a couple of week than it would ever get in a lifetime its liver expand by eight time suffice to say it be like it be not the pretty picture of sustainable farming the problem for we chef be that it be so freakin delicious laughter I mean I love the stuff it be fatty it be sweet it be silky it be unctuous it make everything else you put it with taste incredible can we produce a menu that be delicious without foie gras yes sure you can also bike the Tour de France without steroid right laughter not a lot of person be do it and for good reason laughter so several month ago a friend of mine send I this link to this guy Eduardo Sousa Eduardo be do what he call natural foie gras natural foie gras what be natural about foie gras to take advantage of when the temperature drop in the fall goose and duck gorge on food to prepare for the harsh reality of winter and the rest of the year they be free to roam around Eduardo land and eat what they want so no gavage no force feed no factory like condition no cruelty and it be shockingly not a new idea he great granddad start Pater a de Sousa in 1812 and they have be do it quietly ever since that be until last year when Eduardo win the Coup de Coeur the coveted French gastronomic prize it be like the Olympics of food product he place first for he foie gras big big problem as he say to I that really piss the French off laughter he say it sort of gleefully it be all over the paper I read about it it be in Le Monde Spanish chef accuse and the French accuse he Spanish chef accuse of cheat they accuse he of pay off the judge they implicate actually the Spanish government amazingly huh amazing a huge scandal for a few week could not find a shred of evidence now look at the guy he do not look like a guy who be pay off French judge for he foie gras so that die down and very soon afterward new controversy he should not win because it be not foie gras it be not foie gras because it be not gavage there be no force feeding so by definition he be lie and should be disqualify as funny as it sound articulate it now and read about it actually if we have talk about it before this controversy I would have say that be kind of true you know foie gras by definition force feed it be gavage and that be what you get when you want foie gras that be until I go to Eduardo farm in Extremadura 50 mile north of Seville right on the Portugal border I see first hand a system that be incredibly complex and then at the same time like everything beautiful in nature be utterly simple and he say to I really from the first moment my life work be to give the goose what they want he repeat that about 50 time in the two day I be with he I be just here to give the goose what they want actually when I show up he be lie down with the goose with he cell phone take picture of they like he child in the grass amazing he be really just in love with he be at one with he be the goose whisperer laughter and when I be speak to he you know I think like I be speak to you now right but sort of in the middle of my question my excited question because the more I get to know he and he system the more exciting this whole idea become he keep go like this to I and I think ok excited Jew from New York right I be talk a little too aggressively whatever so you know I slow down and finally by the end of the day I be like Ed uar do you know like this but he be still go like this I figure it out I be speak too loudly so I hush my voice I kind of like ask this question and chat with he through a translator in kind of a half whisper and he stop do this and amazingly the goose who be on the other side of the paddock when I be around get the hell away from this kid when I lower my voice they all come right up to we right up to we like right up to here right along the fence line and fence line be amazing in itself the fence like this conception of fence that we have it be totally backward with he the electricity on this fiberglass fence be only on the outside he rewire it he invent it I have never see it have you you fence in animal you electrify the inside he do not he electrify only the outside why because he say to I that he feel like the goose and he prove this actually not just a conceit he prove this the goose feel manipulate when they be imprison in they little paddock even though they be imprison in this Garden of Eden with fig and everything else he feel like they feel manipulate so he get rid of the electricity he get rid of current on the inside and keep it on the outside so it would protect they against coyote and other predator now what happen they eat and he show I on a chart how they eat about 20 percent more feed to feed they liver the landscape be incredible I mean he farm be incredible it really be the Garden of Eden there be fig and everything else there for the take and the irony of irony be because Extremadura the area what do Extremadura mean Extra hard land right Extra difficult Extra hard but over four generation he and he family have literally transform this extra hard land into a taste menu upgrade the life for this goose and they be allow to take whatever they want another irony the double irony be that on the fig and the olive Eduardo can make more money sell that than he can on the foie gras he do not care he let they take what they want and he say usually it be about 50 percent they be very fair the other 50 percent he take and he sell and he make money on they part of the income for he farm a big part of he income for he farm but he never control it they get what they want they leave the rest for I and I sell it he big obstacle really be the marketplace which demand this day bright yellow foie gras that be how I have be train you want to look and see what good foie gras be it be get to be bright yellow it be the indication that it be the good foie gras well because he do not force feed because he do not gavage ton of corn he liver be pretty grey or they be but he find this wild plant call the lupin bush the lupin bush it be all around Extremadura he let it go to seed he take the seed he plant it on he 30 acre all around and the goose love the lupin bush not for the bush but for the seed and when they eat the seed they foie gras turn yellow Radioactive yellow bright yellow of the high quality foie gras yellow I have ever see laughter so I be listen to all this you know and I be like be this guy for real be he make some of this up be he like you know because he seem to have a answer for everything and it be always nature it be never he and I be like you know I always get a little like weird out by person who deflect everything away from themselves because really they want you to look at themselves right but he deflect everything away from he ingenuity into work with he landscape so it be like here I be I be on the fence about this guy but increasingly eat up he every word and we be sit there and I hear clapping from a distance so I look over and he grab my arm and the translator and duck we under a bush and say watch this Shush he say again for the 500th time to I shush watch this and this squadron of goose come over clapping and they be get loud loud loud like really loud right over we and like airport traffic control as they start to go past we they be call back and they be call back and back and back and then they circle around and he goose be call up now to the wild goose clap and the wild goose be call down clapping and it be get loud and loud and they circle and circle and they land and I be just say no way laughter no way and I look at Eduardo who be near tear look at this and I say you be tell I that you goose be call to the wild goose to say come for a visit and he say no no no they have come to stay they have come to stay laughter it be like the dna of a goose be to fly south in the winter right I say that I say be not that what they be put on this earth for to fly south in the winter and north when it get warm he say no no no they dna be to find the condition that be conducive to life to happiness they find it here they do not need anything more they stop they mate with he domesticate goose and he flock continue think about that for a minute it be brilliant right imagine I do not know imagine a hog farm in like North Carolina and a wild pig come upon a factory farm and decide to stay laughter so how do it taste I finally get to taste it before I leave he take I to he neighborhood restaurant and he serve I some of he foie gras confit de foie gras it be incredible and the problem with say that of course be that you know at this point it risk hyperbole really easily and I would like to make a metaphor but I do not have one really I be drink this guy Kool Aid so much he could have serve I goose feather and I would have be like this guy a genius you know I be really in love with he at this point but it truly be the good foie gras of my life so much so that I do not think I have ever really have foie gras until that moment I have have something that be call foie gras but this be transformative really transformative and I say to you I might not stick to this but I do not think I will ever serve foie gras on my menu again because of that taste experience with Eduardo it be sweet it be unctuous it have all the quality of foie gras but its fat have a lot of integrity and a lot of honesty and you could taste herb you could taste spice and I keep I say you know I swear to God I taste star anise I be sure of it and I be not like some super taster you know but I can taste thing there be 100 percent star anise in there and he say no and I end up like go down the spice and finally it be like ok salt and pepper thinking he be salt and pepper he liver but no he take the liver when he harvest the foie gras he stick they in this jar and he confit it no salt no pepper no oil no spice what we go back out for the final tour of the farm and he show I the wild pepper plant and the plant that he make sure exist on he farm for salinity he do not need salt and pepper and he do not need spice because he be get this potpourri of herb and flavor that he goose love to gorge on I turn to he at the end of the meal and it be a question I ask several time and he have not kind of answer I directly but I say now look you be in Spain some of the great chef in the world be Ferran Adria the preeminent chef of the world today not that far from you how come you do not give he this how come no one really hear of you and it may be because of the wine or it may be because of my excitement he answer I directly and he say because chef do not deserve my foie gras laughter and he be right he be right chef take foie gras and they make it they own they create a dish where all the vector point at we with Eduardo it be about the expression of nature and as he say I think fittingly it be a gift from God with God say you have do good work simple I fly home I be on the flight with my little black book and I take you know page and page of note about it I really be move and in the corner of one of this one of my note be this note that say when ask what do you think of conventional foie gras what do you think of foie gras that 99 99999 percent of the world eat he say I think it be a insult to history and I write insult to history I be on the plane and I be just tear my hair out it be like why do not I follow up on that what the hell do that mean insult to history so I do some research when I get back and here be what I find the history of foie gras Jews invent foie gras true story true story by accident they be look for a alternative to schmaltz get sick of the chicken fat they be look for a alternative and they see in the fall that there be this natural beautiful sweet delicious fat from goose and they slaughter they use the fat throughout the winter for cook the Pharaoh get wind of this this be true right off the internet the Pharaoh get laughter I swear to God laughter the Pharaoh get wind of this and want to taste it he taste it and fall in love with it he start demand it and he do not want it just in the fall he want it all year round and he demand that the Jews supply enough for everyone and the Jews fear for they life have to come up with a ingenious idea or at least try and satisfy the Pharaoh wish of course and they invent what Gavage they invent gavage in a great moment of fear for they life and they provide the Pharaoh with gavage liver and the good stuff they keep for themselves supposedly anyway I believe that one that be the history of foie gras and if you think about it it be the history of industrial agriculture it be the history of what we eat today most of what we eat today mega farm feed lot chemical amendment long distance travel food process all of it we food system that be also a insult to history it be a insult to the basic law of nature and of biology whether we be talk about beef cattle or we be talk about chicken or we be talk about broccoli or Brussels sprout or in the case of this morning New York Times catfish which wholesale be go out of business whatever it be it be a mindset that be reminiscent of General Motors it be root in extraction take more sell more waste more and for the future it will not serve we Jonas Salk have a great quote he say if all the insect disappear life on Earth as we know it would disappear within 50 year if human being disappear life on Earth as we know it would flourish and he be right we need now to adopt a new conception of agriculture really new one in which we stop treat the planet as if it be some kind of business in liquidation and stop degrading resource under the guise of cheap food we can start by look to farmer like Eduardo Farmers that rely on nature for solution for answer rather than impose solution on nature listen as Janine Benyus one of my favorite writer and thinker about this topic say listen to nature operating instruction that be what Eduardo do and do so brilliantly and what he show I and what he can show all of we I think be that the great thing for chef the great blessing for chef and for person that care about food and cooking be that the most ecological choice for food be also the most ethical choice for food whether we be talk about Brussels sprout or foie gras and it be also almost always and I have not find a example otherwise but almost always the most delicious choice that be serendipitous thank you applause
