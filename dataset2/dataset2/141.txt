I have 18 minute to tell you what happen over the past six million year all right we all have come from a long way here in Africa and converge in this region of Africa which be a place where 90 percent of we evolutionary process take place and I say that not because I be African but it be in Africa that you find the early evidence for human ancestor upright walk trace even the first technology in the form of stone tool so we all be African and welcome home all right I be a paleoanthropologist and my job be to define man place in nature and explore what make we human and today I will use Selam the early child ever discover to tell you a story of all of we Selam be we most complete skeleton of a three year old girl who live and die 3 3 million year ago she belong to the species know as Australopithecus afarensis you do not need to remember that that be the Lucy species and be find by my research team in December of 2000 in a area call Dikika it be in the northeastern part of Ethiopia and Selam mean peace in many Ethiopian language we use that name to celebrate peace in the region and in the planet and the fact that it be the cover story of all this famous magazine give you already a idea of she significance I think after I be invite by TED I do some digging because that be what we do to know about my host you do not just jump into a invitation and I learn that the first technology appear in the form of stone tool 2 6 million year ago First entertainment come evidence from flute that be 35 000 year old and evidence for first design come 75 000 year old bead and you can do the same with you gene and track they back in time and dna analysis of live human and chimpanzee teach we today that we diverge sometime around seven million year ago and that this two species share over 98 percent of the same genetic material I think know this be a very useful context within which we can think of we ancestry however dna analysis inform we only about the beginning and the end tell we nothing about what happen in the middle so for we paleoanthropologist we job be to find the hard evidence the fossil evidence to fill in this gap and see the different stage of development because it be only when you do that that you can talk about laughter it be only when you do that that you can talk about how we look like and how we behave at different time and how that likes and look and behavior change through time that then give you a access to explore the biological mechanism and force that be responsible for this gradual change that make we what we be today but find the hard evidence be a very complicated endeavor it be a systematic and scientific approach which take you to place that be remote hot hostile and often with no access just to give you a example when I go to Dikika where Selam be find in 99 and it be about 500 kilometer from Addis Ababa the capital of Ethiopia it take we only seven hour to do the first 470 kilometer of the 500 but take four solid hour to do the last only 30 kilometer with the help of the local and use just shovel and pick I make my way I be the first person to actually drive a car to the spot when you get there this be what you see and it be the vastness of the place which make you feel helpless and vulnerable and once you make it there the big question be where to start laughter and you find nothing for year and year when I go to place like this which be paleontological site it be like go to a game park a extinct game park but what you find be not the human remain such as Selam and Lucy on a day to day basis you find elephant rhino monkey pig etc but you could ask how could this large mammal live in this desert environment of course they can not but I be tell you already that the environment and the carry capacity of this region be drastically different from what we have today a very important environmental lesson could be learn from this anyway once we make it there then it be a game park as I say a extinct game park and we ancestor live in that game park but be just the minority they be not as successful and as widespread as the Homo sapiens that we be to tell you just a example a anecdote about they rarity I be go to this place every year and would do fieldwork here and the assistant of course help I do the survey they would find a bone and tell I here be what you be look for I would say no that be a elephant again another one that be a monkey that be a pig etc so one of my assistant who never go to school say to I listen Zeray you either do not know what you be look for or you be look in the wrong place he say laughter and I say why because there be elephant and lion and the person be scared and go somewhere else let go somewhere else well he be very tired and it be really tiring it be then after such hard work and many frustrating year that we find Selam and you see the face here cover by sandstone and here be actually the spinal column and the whole torso encase in a sandstone block because she be bury by a river what you have here seem to be nothing but contain a incredible amount of scientific information that help we explore what make we human this be the early and most complete juvenile human ancestor ever find in the history of paleoanthropology a amazing piece of we long long history there be this three person and I and I be take the picture that be why I be not in how would you feel if you be I you have something extraordinary in you hand but you be in the middle of nowhere the feeling I have be a deep and quiet happiness and excitement of course accompany by a huge sense of responsibility of make sure everything be safe here be a close up of the fossil after five year of clean preparation and description which be very long as I have to expose the bone from the sandstone block I just show you in the previous slide it take five year in a way this be like the second birth for the child after 3 3 million year but the labor be very long and here be full scale it be a tiny bone and in the middle be the minister of Ethiopian tourism who come to visit the National Museum of Ethiopia while I be work there and you see I worried and try to protect my child because you do not leave anyone with this kind of child even a minister so then once you have do that the next stage be to know what it be laughter once that be do then it be possible to compare we be able to tell that she belong to the human family tree because the leg the foot and some feature clearly show that she walk upright and upright walking be a hallmark in humanity but in addition if you compare the skull with a comparably aged chimpanzee and little George Bush here you see that you have vertical forehead and you see that in human because of the development of the pre frontal cortex it be call you do not see that in chimpanzee and you do not see this very project canine so she belong to we family tree but within that of course you do detail analysis and we know now that she belong to the Lucy species know as Australopithecus afarensis the next exciting question be girl or boy and how old be she when she die you can determine the sex of the individual base on the size of the tooth how you know in primate there be this phenomenon call sexual dimorphism which simply mean male be large than female and male have large tooth than the female but to do that you need the permanent dentition which you do not see here because what you have here be the baby tooth but use the ct scan technology which be normally use for medical purpose you can go deep into the mouth and come up with this beautiful image show you both the baby tooth here and the still grow adult tooth here so when you measure that tooth it be clear that she turn out to be a girl with very small canine tooth and to know how old she be when she die what you do be you do a informed estimate and you say how much time would be require to form this amount of tooth and the answer be three so this girl die when she be about three 3 3 million year ago so with all that information the big question be what do we actually what do she tell we to answer this question we can phrase another question what do we actually know about we ancestor we want to know how they look like how they behave how they walk around and how they live and grow up and among the answer that you can get from this skeleton be include first this skeleton document for the first time how infant look over three million year ago and second she tell we that she walk upright but have some adaptation for tree climb and more interesting however be the brain in this child be still grow at age three if you have a still grow brain it be a human behavior in chimp by age three the brain be form over 90 percent that be why they can cope with they environment very easily after birth fast than we anyway but in human we continue to grow we brain that be why we need care from we parent but that care means also you learn you spend more time with you parent and that be very characteristic of human and it be call childhood which be this extended dependence of human child on they family or parent so the still grow brain in this individual tell we that childhood which require a incredible social organization a very complex social organization emerge over three million year ago so by be at the cusp of we evolutionary history selam unite we all and give we a unique account on what make we human but not everything be human and I will give you a very exciting example this be call the hyoid bone it be a bone which be right here it support you tongue from behind it be in a way you voice box it determine the type of voice you produce it be not know in the fossil record and we have it in this skeleton when we do the analysis of this bone it be clear that it look very chimp like chimpanzee like so if you be there 3 3 million year ago to hear when this girl be cry out for she mother she would have sound more like a chimpanzee than a human maybe you be wonder so you see this ape feature human feature ape feature what do that tell we you know that be very exciting for we because it demonstrate that thing be change slowly and progressively and that evolution be in the make to summarize the significance of this fossil we can say the follow up to now the knowledge that we have about we ancestor come essentially from adult individual because the fossil the baby fossil be miss they do not preserve well as you know so the knowledge that we have about we ancestor on how they look like how they behave be kind of biased toward adult imagine somebody come from Mars and he job be to report on the type of person occupy we planet Earth and you hide all the baby the child and he go back and report can you imagine how much biased he report would be that be what somehow we be do so far in the absence of the fossil child so I think the new fossil fix this problem so I think the most important question at the end be what do we actually learn from specimen like this and from we past in general of course in addition to extract this huge amount of scientific information as to what make we human you know the many human ancestor that have exist over the past six million year and there be more than 10 they do not have the knowledge the technology and sophistication that we Homo sapiens have today but if this species ancient species would travel in time and see we today they would very much be very proud of they legacy because they become the ancestor of the most successful species in the universe and they be probably not aware of this future legacy but they do great now the question be we Homo sapiens today be in a position to decide about the future of we planet possibly more so the question be be we up to the challenge and can we really do good than this primitive small brained ancestor among the most pressing challenge that we species be face with today be the chronic problem of Africa needless to list they here and there be more competent person to talk about this still in my opinion we have two choice one be to continue to see a poor ill cry Africa carry gun that depend on other person forever or to promote a Africa which be confident peaceful independent but cognizant of its huge problem and great value at the same time I be for the second option and I be sure many of you be and the key be to promote a positive African attitude towards Africa that be because we African concentrate I be from Ethiopia by the way we concentrate too much on how we be see from elsewhere or from outside I think it be important to promote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves that be what I call positive African attitude so finally I would like to say so let help Africa walk upright and forward then we all can be proud of we future legacy as a species thank you applause
