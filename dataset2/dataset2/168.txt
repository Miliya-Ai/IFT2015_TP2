welcome to five dangerous thing you should let you child do I do not have child I borrow my friend child so laughter take all this advice with a grain of salt I be Gever Tulley I be a contract computer scientist by trade but I be the founder of something call the Tinkering School it be a summer program which aim to help kid learn how to build the thing that they think of so we build a lot of thing and I do put power tool into the hand of second grader so if you be think about send you kid to Tinkering School they do come back bruise scrape and bloody laughter you know we live in a world that be subject to ever more stringent child safety regulation there do not seem to be any limit on how crazy child safety regulation can get we put suffocation warning on every piece of plastic film manufacture in the United States or for sale with a item in the United States we put warning on coffee cup to tell we that the contents may be hot and we seem to think that any item sharp than a golf ball be too sharp for child under the age of 10 so where do this trend stop when we round every corner and eliminate every sharp object every pokey bit in the world then the first time that kid come in contact with anything sharp or not make out of round plastic they will hurt themselves with it so as the boundary of what we determine as the safety zone grow ever small we cut off we child from valuable opportunity to learn how to interact with the world around they and despite all of we good effort and intention kid be always go to figure out how to do the most dangerous thing they can in whatever environment they can laughter so despite the provocative title this presentation be really about safety and about some simple thing that we can do to raise we kid to be creative confident and in control of the environment around they and what I now present to you be a excerpt from a book in progress the book be call 50 dangerous thing this be five dangerous thing thing number one play with fire learning to control one of the most elemental force in nature be a pivotal moment in any child personal history whether we remember it or not it be the first time we really get control of one of this mysterious thing this mystery be only reveal to that who get the opportunity to play with it so play with fire this be like one of the great thing we ever discover fire from play with it they learn some basic principle about fire about intake combustion exhaust this be the three work element of fire that you have to have for a good controlled fire and you can think of the open pit fire as a laboratory you do not know what they be go to learn from play with it let they fool around with it on they own term and trust I they be go to learn thing that you can not get out of play with Dora the Explorer toy laughter number two own a pocketknife pocketknife be kind of drift out of we cultural consciousness which I think be a terrible thing laughter you first pocketknife be like the first universal tool that you be give you know it be a spatula it be a pry bar it be a screwdriver and it be a blade yeah and it be a powerful and empower tool and in a lot of culture they give knife like as soon as they be toddler they have knife this be Inuit child cut whale blubber I first see this in a Canadian Film Board film when I be 10 and it leave a last impression to see baby play with knife and it show that kid can develop a extended sense of self through a tool at a very young age you lay down a couple of very simple rule always cut away from you body keep the blade sharp never force it and this be thing kid can understand and practice with and yeah they be go to cut themselves I have some terrible scar on my leg from where I stab myself but you know they be young they heal fast laughter number three throw a spear it turn out that we brain be actually wire for throw thing and like muscle if you do not use part of you brain they tend to atrophy over time but when you exercise they any give muscle add strength to the whole system and that apply to you brain too so practice throw thing have be show to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobe which have to do with visual acuity 3d understanding and structural problem solve so it help develop they visualization skill and they predictive ability and throwing be a combination of analytical and physical skill so it be very good for that kind of whole body training this kind of target base practice also help kid develop attention and concentration skill so that be great number four Deconstruct appliance there be a world of interesting thing inside you dishwasher next time you be about to throw out a appliance do not throw it out take it apart with you kid or send he to my school and we will take it apart with they even if you do not know what the part be puzzle out what they might be for be a really good practice for the kid to get sort of the sense that they can take thing apart and no matter how complex they be they can understand part of they and that mean that eventually they can understand all of they it be a sense of knowability that something be knowable so this black box that we live with and take for grant be actually complex thing make by other person and you can understand they number five two parter Break the Digital millennium copyright act laughter there be law beyond safety regulation that attempt to limit how we can interact with the thing that we own in this case digital media it be a very simple exercise buy a song on itune write it to a cd then rip the cd to a mp3 and play it on you very same computer you have just break a law technically the RIAA could come and prosecute you it be a important lesson for kid to understand that some of this law get break by accident and that law have to be interpret that be something we often talk about with the kid when we be fool around with thing and break they open and take they apart and use they for other thing and also when we go out and drive a car drive a car be a really empower act for a young child so this be the alternate laughter for that of you who be not comfortable actually break the law you can drive a car with you child this be a great stage for a kid this happen about the same time that they get latch onto thing like dinosaur this big thing in the outside world that they be try to get a grip on a car be a similar object and they can get in a car and drive it and that really give they a handle on a world in a way that they do not often have access to and it be perfectly legal find a big empty lot make sure there be nothing in it and that it be on private property and let they drive you car it be very safe actually and it be fun for the whole family laughter let see I think that be it that be number five and a half ok
