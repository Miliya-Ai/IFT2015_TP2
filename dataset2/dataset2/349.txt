I be just go to play a brief video clip video on the fifth of December 1985 a bottle of 1787 Lafitte be sell for 105 000 pound nine time the previous world record the buyer be Kip Forbes son of one of the most flamboyant millionaire of the 20th century the original owner of the bottle turn out to be one of the most enthusiastic wine buff of the 18th century ch teau Lafitte be one of the great wine in the world the prince of any wine cellar Benjamin Wallace now that be about all the videotape that remain of a event that set off the long run mystery in the modern wine world and the mystery exist because of a gentleman name hardy Rodenstock in 1985 he announce to he friend in the wine world that he have make this incredible discovery some workman in Paris have break through a brick wall and happen upon this hidden cache of wine apparently the property of Thomas Jefferson 1787 1784 he would not reveal the exact number of bottle he would not reveal exactly where the building be and he would not reveal exactly who own the building the mystery persist for about 20 year it finally begin to get resolve in 2005 because of this guy Bill Koch be a Florida billionaire who own four of the Jefferson bottle and he become suspicious and he end up spend over a million dollar and hire ex FBI and ex Scotland Yard agent to try to get to the bottom of this there be now ample evidence that hardy Rodenstock be a con man and that the Jefferson bottle be fake but for that 20 year a unbelievable number of really eminent and accomplished figure in the wine world be sort of draw into the orbit of this bottle I think they want to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine in the world must be the good bottle of wine in the world must be the rare bottle of wine in the world I become increasingly kind of voyeuristically interested in the question of you know why do person spend this crazy amount of money not only on wine but on lot of thing and be they live a good life than I so I decide to embark on a quest with the generous backing of a magazine I write for sometimes I decide to sample the very good or most expensive or most coveted item in about a dozen category which be a very grueling quest as you can imagine laughter this be the first one a lot of the Kobe beef that you see in the U S be not the real thing it may come from Wagyu cattle but it be not from the original Appalachian Hyogo Prefecture in Japan there be very few place in the U S where you can try real Kobe and one of they be Wolfgang Puck restaurant cut in Los Angeles I go there and I order the eight ounce rib eye for 160 dollar and it arrive and it be tiny and I be outraged it be like 160 dollar for this and then I take a bite and I wish that it be tiny because Kobe beef be so rich it be like foie gras it be not even like steak I almost could not finish it I be really happy when I be do laughter now the photographer who take the picture for this project for some reason pose he dog in a lot of they so that be why you be go to see this recur character which I guess you know communicate to you that I do not think that one be really worth the price White truffles one of the most expensive luxury food by weight in the world to try this I go to a Mario Batali restaurant in Manhattan Del Posto the waiter you know come out with the white truffle knob and he shaver and he shave it onto my pasta and he say you know would Signore like the truffle and the charm of white truffle be in they aroma it be not in they taste really it be not in they texture it be in the smell this white pearlescent flake hit the noodle this haunting wonderful nutty mushroomy smell waft up 10 second pass and it be go and then I be leave with this little ugly flake on my pasta that you know they purpose have be serve and so I be afraid to say that this be also a disappointment to I there be several several of this item be disappointment laughter yeah the magazine would not pay for I to go there laughter they do give I a tour though and this hotel suite be 4 300 square foot it have 360 degree view it have four balcony it be design by the architect i M Pei it come with its own Rolls Royce and driver it come with its own wine cellar that you can draw freely from when I take the tour it actually include some Opus One I be glad to see 30 000 dollar for a night in a hotel this be soap that be make from silver nanoparticle which have antibacterial property I wash my face with this this morning in preparation for this and it you know tickle a little bit and it smell good but I have to say that nobody here have compliment I on the cleanliness of my face today laughter but then again nobody have compliment I on the jeans I be wear this one GQ do spring for I own this but I will tell you not only do I not get a compliment from any of you I have not get a compliment from anybody in the month that I have own and wear this I do not think that whether or not you be get a compliment should be the test of something value but I think in the case of a fashion item a article of clothing that be a reasonable benchmark that say a lot of work go into this they be make from handpick organic Zimbabwean cotton that have be shuttle loom and then hand dip in natural indigo 24 time but no compliment laughter thank you Armando Manni be a former filmmaker who make this olive oil from a olive that grow on a single slope in Tuscany and he go to great length to protect the olive oil from oxygen and light he use tiny bottle the glass be tint he top the olive oil off with a inert gas and he actually once he release a batch of it he regularly conduct molecular analysis and post the result online so you can go online and look at you batch number and see how the phenolic be develop and you know gauge its freshness I do a blind taste test of this with 20 person and five other olive oils it taste fine it taste interesting it be very green it be very peppery but in the blind taste test it come in last the olive oil that come in first be actually a bottle of Whole Foods 365 olive oil which have be oxidize next to my stove for six month laughter a recur theme be that a lot of this thing be from Japan you will start to notice I do not play golf so I could not actually road test this but I do interview a guy who own they even the person who market this club I mean they will say this have four axis shaft which minimize loss of club speed and thereby drive the ball far but they will say look you know you be not get 57 000 dollar worth of performance from this club you be pay for the bling that they be encrust with gold and platinum the guy who I interview who own they do say that he be get a lot of pleasure out of they so oh yeah you know this one this be a coffee make from a very unusual process the luwak be a Asian palm civet it be a cat that live in tree and at night it come down and it prowl the coffee plantation and apparently it be a very picky eater and it you know hone in on only the ripe coffee cherry and then a enzyme in its digestive tract leech into the bean and person with the unenviable job of collect this cat leavings then go through the forest collect the you know result and process it into coffee although you actually can buy it in the unprocessed form that be right unrelatedly laughter Japan be do crazy thing with toilet laughter there be now a toilet that have a mp3 player in it there be one with a fragrance dispenser there be one that actually analyze the contents of the bowl and transmit the result via email to you doctor it be almost like a home medical center and that be the direction that Japanese toilet technology be head in this one do not have that bell and whistle but for pure functionality it be pretty much the good the neor 600 and to try this I could not get a loaner but I do go into the Manhattan showroom of the manufacturer Toto and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use which I use it be fully automate you walk towards it and the seat lift the seat be preheated there be a water jet that clean you there be a air jet that dry you you get up it flush by itself the lid close it self clean not only be it a technological leap forward but I really do believe it be a bit of a cultural leap forward I mean a no hand no toilet paper toilet and I want to get one of this laughter this be another one I could not get a loaner of Tom Cruise supposedly own this bed there be a little plaque on the end that you know each buyer get they name engrave on it laughter to try this one the maker of it let I and my wife spend the night in the Manhattan showroom light glare in off the street and we have to hire a security guard and all this thing but anyway we have a great night sleep and you spend a third of you life in bed I do not think it be that bad of a deal laughter this be a fun one this be the fast street legal car in the world and the most expensive production car I get to drive this with a chaperone from the company a professional race car driver and we drive around the canyon outside of Los Angeles and down on the Pacific Coast Highway and you know when we pull up to a stoplight the person in the adjacent car kind of give we respectful nod and it be really amazing it be such a smooth ride most of the car that I drive if I get up to 80 they start to rattle I switch lane on the highway and the driver this chaperone say you know you be just go 110 mile a hour and I have no idea that I be one of that obnoxious person you occasionally see weaving in and out of traffic because it be just that smooth and if I be a billionaire I would get one laughter this be a completely gratuitous video I be just go to show of one of the pitfall of advanced technology this be Tom Cruise arrive at the Mission impossible iii premiere when he try to open the door you could call it Mission impossible iv there be one object that I could not get my hand on and that be the 1947 Cheval Blanc the 47 Cheval Blanc be probably the most mythologized wine of the 20th century and Cheval Blanc be kind of a unusual wine for Bordeaux in have a significant percentage of the Cabernet Franc grape and 1947 be a legendary vintage especially in the right bank of Bordeaux and just together that vintage and that chateau take on this aura that eventually kind of give it this cultish follow but it be 60 year old there be not much of it leave what there be of it leave you do not know if it be real it be consider to be the most fake wine in the world not that many person be look to pop open they one remain bottle for a journalist so I have about give up try to get my hand on one of this I would put out feeler to retailer to auctioneer and it be come up empty and then I get a email from a guy name Bipin Desai Bipin Desai be a u C Riverside theoretical physicist who also happen to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tasting and he say I have get a taste come up where we be go to serve the 47 Cheval Blanc and it be go to be a double vertical it be go to be 30 vintage of Cheval Blanc and 30 vintage of Yquem and it be a invitation you do not refuse I go it be three day four meal and at lunch on Saturday we open the 47 and you know it have this fragrant softness and it smell a little bit of linseed oil and then I taste it and it you know have this kind of unctuous porty richness which be characteristic of that wine that it sort of resemble port in a lot of way there be person at my table who think it be you know fantastic there be some person who be a little less impressed and I be not that impressed and I do not call my palate a philistine palate so it do not necessarily mean something that I be not impressed but I be not the only one there who have that reaction and it be not just to that wine any one of the wine serve at this taste if I have be serve it at a dinner party it would have be you know the wine experience of my lifetime and incredibly memorable but drink 60 great wine over three day they all just blur together and it become almost a grueling experience and I just want to finish by mention a very interesting study which come out early this year from some researcher at Stanford and Caltech and they give subject the same wine label with different price tag a lot of person you know say that they like the more expensive wine more it be the same wine but they think it be a different one that be more expensive but what be unexpected be that this researcher do mri brain imaging while the person be drink the wine and not only do they say they enjoy the more expensively label wine more they brain actually register as experience more pleasure from the same wine when it be label with a high price tag thank you
