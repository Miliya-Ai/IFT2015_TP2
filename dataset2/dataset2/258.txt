the decorative use of wire in southern Africa date back hundred of year but modernization actually bring communication and a whole new material in the form of telephone wire rural to urban migration mean that newfound industrial material start to replace hard to come by natural grass so here you can see the change from use start to use contemporary material this piece date back from the 40 to the late 50 in the 90 my interest and passion for transitional art form lead I to a new form which come from a squatter camp outside Durban and I get the opportunity to start work with this community at that point and start develop really and mentore they in term of scale in term of the design and the project soon grow from five to 50 weaver in about a year soon we have outgrow the scrap yard what they could provide so we coerce a wire manufacturer to help we and not only to supply the material on bobbin but to produce to we color specification at the same time I be think well there be lot of possibility here to produce contemporary product away from the ethnic a little bit more contemporary so I develop a whole range around mass produce range that obviously fit into a much high end decor market that could be export and also service we local market we start experiment as you can see in term of shape form the scale become very important and it be become we pet project it be successful it be be run for 12 year and we supply the Conran shop and Donna Karan and so it be kind of great this be we group we main group of weaver they come on a weekly basis to Durban they all have bank account they have all move back to the rural area where they come from it be a weekly turnaround of production this be the community that I originally show you the slide of and that be also modernize today and it be support work for 300 weaver and the rest say it all thank you very much applause
