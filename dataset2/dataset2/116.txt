first place I would like to take you be what many believe will be the world deep natural abyss and I say believe because this process be still ongoing right now there be major expedition be plan for next year that I will talk a little bit about one of the thing that be change here in the last 150 year since Jules Verne have great science fiction concept of what the underworld be like be that technology have enable we to go to this place that be previously completely unknown and speculate about we can now descend thousand of meter into the Earth with relative impunity along the way we have discover fantastic abyss and chamber so large that you can see for hundred of meter without a break in the line of sight when you go on a thing like this we can usually be in the field for anywhere from two to four month with a team as small as 20 or 30 to as big as 150 and a lot of person ask I you know what kind of person do you get for a project like this while we selection process be not as rigorous as NASA it be nonetheless thorough we be look for competence discipline endurance and strength in case you be wonder this be we strength test laughter but we also value esprit de corps and the ability to diplomatically resolve inter personal conflict while under great stress in remote location we have already go far beyond the limit of human endurance from the entrance this be nothing like a commercial cave you be look at Camp two in a place call J2 not k2 but j2 we be roughly two day from the entrance at that point and it be kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse except that you be now run a string of this thing down the idea be to try to provide some measure of physical comfort while you be down there otherwise in damp moist cold condition in utterly dark place I should mention that everything you be see here by the way be artificially illuminate at great effort otherwise it be completely dark in this place the deep you go the more you run into a conflict with water it be basically like a tree collect water come down and eventually you get to place where it be formidable and dangerous and unfortunately slide just do not do justice so I have get a very brief clip here that be take in the late 1980 so descend into Huautla Plateau in Mexico Video now I have to tell you that the technique be show here be obsolete and dangerous we would not do this today unless we be do it for film laughter along that same line I have to tell you that with the spate of Hollywood movie that come out last year we have never see monster underground at least the kind that eat you if there be a monster underground it be the crush psychological remoteness that begin to hit every member of the team once you cross about three day inbound from the near entrance next year I will be lead a international team to j2 we be go to be shoot from minus 2 600 meter that be a little over 8 600 foot down at 30 kilometer from the entrance the lead crew will be underground for push 30 day straight I do not think there be be a mission like that in a long time eventually if you keep go down in this thing probability say that you be go to run into a place like this it be a place where there be a fold in the geologic stratum that collect water and fill to the roof and when you use to find this thing they would put a label on a map that say terminal siphon now I remember that term really well for two reason number one it be the name of my rock band and second be because the confrontation of this thing force I to become a inventor and we have since go on to develop many generation of gadget for explore place like this this be some life support equipment close cycle and you can use that now to go for many kilometer horizontally underwater and to depths of 200 meter straight down underwater when you do this kind of stuff it be like do EVA it be like do extra vehicular activity in space but at much great distance and at much great physical peril so it make you think about how to design you equipment for long range away from a safe haven here be a clip from a National Geographic movie that come out in 1999 video Narrator Exploration be a physical process of put you foot in place where human have never step before this be where the last little nugget of totally unknown territory remain on this planet to experience it be a privilege Bill Stone that be take in Wakulla Springs Florida couple of thing to note about that movie every piece of equipment that you see in there do not exist before 1999 it be develop within a two year period and use on actual exploratory project this gadget you see right here be call the digital wall mapper and it produce the first three dimensional map anybody have ever do of a cave and it happen to be underwater in Wakulla Springs it be that gadget that serendipitously open a door to another unexplored world this be Europa Carolyn Porco mention another one call Enceladus the other day this be one of the place where planetary scientist believe there be a high probability of the detection of the first life off earth in the ocean that exist below there for that who have never see this story Jim Cameron produce a really wonderful imax movie couple of year ago call alien of the Deep there be a brief clip video narrator a mission to explore under the ice of Europa would be the ultimate robotic challenge Europa be so far away that even at the speed of light it would take more than a hour for the command just to reach the vehicle it have to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazard and to find a good landing site on the ice now we have to get through the ice you need a melt probe it be basically a nuclear heated torpedo the ice could be anywhere from three to 16 mile deep week after week the melt probe will sink of its own weight through the ancient ice until finally now what be you go to do when you reach the surface of that ocean you need a auv a autonomous underwater vehicle it need to be one smart puppy able to navigate and make decision on its own in a alien ocean bs what Jim do not know when he release that movie be that six month early NASA have fund a team I assemble to develop a prototype for the Europa AUV I mean I cut through three year of engineering meeting design and system integration and introduce DEPTHX Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer and as the movie say this be one smart puppy it be get 96 sensor 36 onboard computer 100 000 line of behavioral autonomy code pack more than 10 kilo of tnt in electrical onboard equivalent this be the target site the world deep hydrothermal spring at Cenote Zacaton in northern Mexico it be be explore to a depth of 292 meter and beyond that nobody know anything this be part of DEPTHX mission there be two primary target we be do here one be how do you do science autonomy underground how do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist there be more stage involve here than I have get time to tell you about but basically we drive through the space we populate it with environmental variable sulphide halide thing like that we calculate gradient surface and drive the bot over to a wall where there be a high probability of life we move along the wall in what be call proximity operation look for change in color if we see something that look interesting we pull it into a microscope if it pass the microscopic test we go for a collection we either draw in a liquid sample or we can actually take a solid core from the wall no hand at the wheel this be all behavioral autonomy here that be be conduct by the robot on its own the real hat trick for this vehicle though be a disruptive new navigation system we have develop know as 3d slam for simultaneous localization and mapping depthx be a all see eyeball its sensor beam look both forward and backward at the same time allow it to do new exploration while it be still achieve geometric sensor lock on what it be go through already what I be go to show you next be the first fully autonomous robotic exploration underground that be ever be do this may we be go to go from minus 1 000 meter in Zacaton and if we be very lucky DEPTHX will bring back the first robotically discover division of bacterium the next step after that be to test it in Antartica and then if the funding continue and NASA have the resolution to go we could potentially launch by 2016 and by 2019 we may have the first evidence of life off this planet what then of manned space exploration the government recently announce plan to return to the moon by 2024 the successful conclusion of that mission will result in infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number of government scientist and pilot it will leave we no further along in the general expansion of humanity into space than we be 50 year ago something fundamental have to change if we be to see common access to space in we lifetime what I be go to show you next be a couple of controversial idea and I hope you will bear with I and have some faith that there be credibility behind what we be go to say here there be three underpinning of work in space privately one of they be the requirement for economical earth to space transport the Bert Rutans and Richard Bransons of this world have get this in they sight and I salute they go go go the next thing we need be place to stay on orbit Orbital hotel to start with but workshop for the rest of we later on the final missing piece the real paradigm buster be this a gas station on orbit it be not go to look like that if it exist it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning now to give you a chance to understand why there be power in that statement I have get to give you the basics of space 101 and the first thing be everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram anybody drink one of this here this week you would pay 10 000 dollar for that in orbit that be more than you pay for TED if Google drop they sponsorship laughter the second be more than 90 percent of the weight of a vehicle be in propellant thus every time you have want to do anything in space you be literally blow away enormous sum of money every time you hit the accelerator not even the guy at Tesla can fight that physics so what if you could get you gas at a 10th the price there be a place where you can in fact you can get it well you can get it at 14 time low if you can find propellant on the moon there be a little known mission that be launch by the Pentagon 13 year ago now call Clementine and the most amazing thing that come out of that mission be a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater on the south pole of the moon that signal be so strong it could only have be produce by 10 trillion ton of water bury in the sediment collect over million and billion of year by the impact of asteroid and comet material if we be go to get that and make that gas station possible we have to figure out way to move large volume of payload through space we can not do that right now the way you normally build a system right now be you have a tube stack that have to be launch from the ground and resist all kind of aerodynamic force we have to beat that we can do it because in space there be no aerodynamics we can go and use inflatable system for almost everything this be a idea that again come out of Livermore back in 1989 with Dr Lowell Wood group and we can extend that now to just about everything Bob Bigelow currently have a test article in the orbit we can go much further we can build space tug orbit platform for hold cryogen and water there be another thing when you be come back from the moon you have to deal with orbital mechanic it say you be move 10 000 foot per second fast than you really want to be to get back to you gas station you get two choice you can burn rocket fuel to get there or you can do something really incredible you can dive into the stratosphere and precisely dissipate that velocity and come back out to the space station it have never be do it be risky and it be go to be one hell of a ride good than Disney the traditional approach to space exploration have be that you carry all the fuel you need to get everybody back in case of a emergency if you try to do that for the moon you be go to burn a billion dollar in fuel alone send a crew out there but if you send a mining team there without the return propellant first laughter do any of you guy hear the story of Cortez this be not like that I be much more like Scotty I like this equipment you know and I really value it so we be not go to burn the gear but if you be truly bold you could get it there manufacture it and it would be the most dramatic demonstration that you could do something worthwhile off this planet that have ever be do there be a myth that you can not do anything in space for less than a trillion dollar and 20 year that be not true in seven year we could pull off a industrial mission to Shackleton and demonstrate that you could provide commercial reality out of this in low earth orbit we be live in one of the most exciting time in history we be at a magical confluence where private wealth and imagination be drive the demand for access to space the orbital refueling station I have just describe could create a entirely new industry and provide the final key for opening space to the general exploration to bust the paradigm a radically different approach be need we can do it by jump start with a industrial Lewis and Clark expedition to Shackleton crater to mine the moon for resource and demonstrate they can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit talk about space always seem to be hang on ambiguity of purpose and timing I would like to close here by put a stake in the sand at TED I intend to lead that expedition applause it can be do in seven year with the right backing that who join I in make it happen will become a part of history and join other bold individual from time past who have they be here today would have heartily approve there be once a time when person do bold thing to open the frontier we have collectively forget that lesson now we be at a time when boldness be require to move forward 100 year after Sir Ernest Shackleton write this word I intend to plant a industrial flag on the moon and complete the final piece that will open the space frontier in we time for all of we thank you applause
