this be a picture of Maurice Druon the Honorary Perpetual Secretary of L Academie francaise the French Academy he be splendidly attire in he 68 000 dollar uniform befitting the role of the French Academy as legislating the correct usage in French and perpetuate the language the French Academy have two main task it compile a dictionary of official French they be now work on they ninth edition which they begin in 1930 and they have reach the letter p they also legislate on correct usage such as the proper term for what the French call email which ought to be courriel the world wide web the French be tell ought to be refer to as la toile d araignee mondiale the global spider web recommendation that the French gaily ignore now this be one model of how language come to be namely it be legislate by a academy but anyone who look at language realize that this be a rather silly conceit that language rather emerge from human mind interact from one another and this be visible in the unstoppable change in language the fact that by the time the Academy finish they dictionary it will already be well out of date we see it in the constant appearance of slang and jargon of the historical change in language in divergence of dialect and the formation of new language so language be not so much a creator or shaper of human nature so much as a window onto human nature in a book that I be currently work on I hope to use language to shed light on a number of aspect of human nature include the cognitive machinery with which human conceptualize the world and the relationship type that govern human interaction and I be go to say a few word about each one this morning let I start off with a technical problem in language that I have worry about for quite some time and indulge I in my passion for verb and how they be use the problem be which verb go in which construction the verb be the chassis of the sentence it be the framework onto which the other part be bolt let I give you a quick reminder of something that you have long forget a intransitive verb such as dine for example can not take a direct object you have to say Sam dine not Sam dine the pizza a transitive verb mandate that there have to be a object there Sam devour the pizza you can not just say Sam devour there be dozen or score of verb of this type each of which shape its sentence so a problem in explain how child learn language a problem in teach language to adult so that they do not make grammatical error and a problem in programming computer to use language be which verb go in which construction for example the dative construction in English you can say give a muffin to a mouse the prepositional dative or give a mouse a muffin the double object dative promise anything to she promise she anything and so on hundred of verb can go both way so a tempting generalization for a child for a adult for a computer be that any verb that can appear in the construction subject verb thing to a recipient can also be express as subject verb recipient thing a handy thing to have because language be infinite and you can not just parrot back the sentence that you have hear you have get to extract generalization so you can produce and understand new sentence this would be a example of how to do that unfortunately there appear to be idiosyncratic exception you can say Biff drive the car to Chicago but not Biff drive Chicago the car you can say Sal give Jason a headache but it be a bit odd to say Sal give a headache to Jason the solution be that this construction despite initial appearance be not synonymous that when you crank up the microscope on human cognition you see that there be a subtle difference in meaning between they so give the x to the y that construction correspond to the thought cause x to go to y whereas give the y the x correspond to the thought cause y to have x now many event can be subject to either construal kind of like the classic figure ground reversal illusion in which you can either pay attention to the particular object in which case the space around it recede from attention or you can see the face in the empty space in which case the object recede out of consciousness how be this construal reflect in language well in both case the thing that be construe as be affect be express as the direct object the noun after the verb so when you think of the event as cause the muffin to go somewhere where you be do something to the muffin you say give the muffin to the mouse when you construe it as cause the mouse to have something you be do something to the mouse and therefore you express it as give the mouse the muffin so which verb go in which construction the problem with which I begin depend on whether the verb specify a kind of motion or a kind of possession change to give something involve both cause something to go and cause someone to have to drive the car only cause something to go because Chicago be not the kind of thing that can possess something only human can possess thing and to give someone a headache cause they to have the headache but it be not as if you be take the headache out of you head and cause it to go to the other person and implant it in they you may just be loud or obnoxious or some other way cause they to have the headache so that be a example of the kind of thing that I do in my day job so why should anyone care well there be a number of interesting conclusion I think from this and many similar kind of analysis of hundred of English verb first there be a level of fine grain conceptual structure which we automatically and unconsciously compute every time we produce or utter a sentence that govern we use of language you can think of this as the language of thought or mentalese it seem to be base on a fix set of concept which govern dozen of construction and thousand of verb not only in English but in all other language fundamental concept such as space time causation and human intention such as what be the means and what be the end this be reminiscent of the kind of category that Immanuel Kant argue be the basic framework for human thought and it be interesting that we unconscious use of language seem to reflect this kantian category do not care about perceptual quality such as color texture weight and speed which virtually never differentiate the use of verb in different construction a additional twist be that all of the construction in English be use not only literally but in a quasi metaphorical way for example this construction the dative be use not only to transfer thing but also for the metaphorical transfer of idea as when we say she tell a story to I or tell I a story Max teach Spanish to the student or teach the student Spanish it be exactly the same construction but no muffin no mouse nothing move at all it evoke the container metaphor of communication in which we conceive of idea as object sentence as container and communication as a kind of send as when we say we gather we idea to put they into word and if we word be not empty or hollow we might get this idea across to a listener who can unpack we word to extract they content and indeed this kind of verbiage be not the exception but the rule it be very hard to find any example of abstract language that be not base on some concrete metaphor for example you can use the verb go and the preposition to and from in a literal spatial sense the messenger go from Paris to Istanbul you can also say Biff go from sick to well he need not go anywhere he could have be in bed the whole time but it be as if he health be a point in state space that you conceptualize as move or the meeting go from three to four in which we conceive of time as stretch along a line likewise we use force to indicate not only physical force as in Rose force the door to open but also interpersonal force as in Rose force Sadie to go not necessarily by manhandle she but by issue a threat or Rose force herself to go as if there be two entity inside Rose head engage in a tug of a war second conclusion be that the ability to conceive of a give event in two different way such as cause something to go to someone and cause someone to have something I think be a fundamental feature of human thought and it be the basis for much human argumentation in which person do not differ so much on the fact as on how they ought to be construe just to give you a few example end a pregnancy versus kill a fetus a ball of cell versus a unborn child invade Iraq versus liberate Iraq redistribute wealth versus confiscate earnings and I think the big picture of all would take seriously the fact that so much of we verbiage about abstract event be base on a concrete metaphor and see human intelligence itself as consist of a repertoire of concept such as object space time causation and intention which be useful in a social knowledge intensive species whose evolution you can well imagine and a process of metaphorical abstraction that allow we to bleach this concept of they original conceptual content space time and force and apply they to new abstract domain therefore allow a species that evolve to deal with rock and tool and animal to conceptualize mathematics physics law and other abstract domain well I say I would talk about two window on human nature the cognitive machinery with which we conceptualize the world and now I be go to say a few word about the relationship type that govern human social interaction again as reflect in language and I will start out with a puzzle the puzzle of indirect speech act now I be sure most of you have see the movie Fargo and you might remember the scene in which the kidnapper be pull over by a police officer be ask to show he driver license and hold he wallet out with a 50 dollar bill extend at a slight angle out of the wallet and he say I be just think that maybe we could take care of it here in Fargo which everyone include the audience interpret as a veiled bribe this kind of indirect speech be rampant in language for example in polite request if someone say if you could pass the guacamole that would be awesome we know exactly what he mean even though that be a rather bizarre concept be express laughter would you like to come up and see my etching I think most person understand the intent behind that and likewise if someone say nice store you have get there it would be a real shame if something happen to it laughter we understand that as a veiled threat rather than a musing of hypothetical possibility so the puzzle be why be bribe polite request solicitation and threat so often veil no one fool both party know exactly what the speaker mean and the speaker know the listener know that the speaker know that the listener know etc etc so what be go on I think the key idea be that language be a way of negotiate relationship and human relationship fall into a number of type there be a influential taxonomy by the anthropologist Alan Fiske in which relationship can be categorize more or less into communality which work on the principle what be mine be thine what be thine be mine the kind of mindset that operate within a family for example dominance whose principle be do not mess with I reciprocity you scratch my back I will scratch yours and sexuality in the immortal word of Cole Porter let do it now relationship type can be negotiate even though there be default situation in which one of this mindset can be apply they can be stretch and extend for example communality apply most naturally within family or friend but it can be use to try to transfer the mentality of share to group that ordinarily would not be dispose to exercise it for example in brotherhood fraternal organization sorority locution like the family of man you try to get person who be not relate to use the relationship type that would ordinarily be appropriate to close kin now mismatch when one person assume one relationship type and another assume a different one can be awkward if you go over and you help yourself to a shrimp off you boss plate for example that would be a awkward situation or if a dinner guest after the meal pull out he wallet and offer to pay you for the meal that would be rather awkward as well in less blatant case there be still a kind of negotiation that often go on in the workplace for example there be often a tension over whether a employee can socialize with the boss or refer to he or she on a first name basis if two friend have a reciprocal transaction like sell a car it be well know that this can be a source of tension or awkwardness in date the transition from friendship to sex can lead to notoriously various form of awkwardness and as can sex in the workplace in which we call the conflict between a dominant and a sexual relationship sexual harassment well what do this have to do with language well language as a social interaction have to satisfy two condition you have to convey the actual content here we get back to the container metaphor you want to express the bribe the command the promise the solicitation and so on but you also have to negotiate and maintain the kind of relationship you have with the other person the solution I think be that we use language at two level the literal form signal the safe relationship with the listener whereas the implicate content the reading between the line that we count on the listener to perform allow the listener to derive the interpretation which be most relevant in context which possibly initiate a changed relationship the simple example of this be in the polite request if you express you request as a conditional if you could open the window that would be great even though the content be a imperative the fact that you be not use the imperative voice mean that you be not act as if you be in a relationship of dominance where you could presuppose the compliance of the other person on the other hand you want the damn guacamole by express it as a if then statement you can get the message across without appear to boss another person around and in a more subtle way I think this work for all of the veiled speech act involve plausible deniability the bribe threat proposition solicitation and so on one way of think about it be to imagine what it would be like if language where it could only be use literally and you can think of it in term of a game theoretic payoff matrix put yourself in the position of the kidnapper want to bribe the officer there be a high stake in the two possibility of have a dishonest officer or a honest officer if you do not bribe the officer then you will get a traffic ticket or as be the case of Fargo bad whether the honest officer be honest or dishonest nothing venture nothing gain in that case the consequence be rather severe on the other hand if you extend the bribe if the officer be dishonest you get a huge payoff of go free if the officer be honest you get a huge penalty of be arrest for bribery so this be a rather fraught situation on the other hand with indirect language if you issue a veiled bribe then the dishonest officer could interpret it as a bribe in which case you get the payoff of go free the honest officer can not hold you to it as be a bribe and therefore you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket so you get the good of both world and a similar analysis I think can apply to the potential awkwardness of a sexual solicitation and other case where plausible deniability be a asset I think this affirm something that be long be know by diplomat namely that the vagueness of language far from be a bug or a imperfection actually might be a feature of language one that we use to we advantage in social interaction so to sum up language be a collective human creation reflect human nature how we conceptualize reality how we relate to one another and then by analyze the various quirk and complexity of language I think we can get a window onto what make we tick thank you very much applause
