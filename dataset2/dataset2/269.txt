let just start by look at some great photograph this be a icon of National Geographic a Afghan refugee take by Steve McCurry but the Harvard Lampoon be about to come out with a parody of National Geographic and I shudder to think what they be go to do to this photograph oh the wrath of Photoshop this be a jet landing at San Francisco by Bruce Dale he mount a camera on the tail a poetic image for a story on Tolstoy by Sam Abell Pygmies in the DRC by Randy Olson I love this photograph because it remind I of Degas bronze sculpture of the little dancer a polar bear swimming in the Arctic by Paul Nicklen Polar bear need ice to be able to move back and forth they be not very good swimmer and we know what be happen to the ice this be camel move across the Rift Valley in Africa photograph by Chris Johns Shot straight down so this be the shadow of the camel this be a rancher in Texas by William Albert Allard a great portraitist and Jane Goodall make she own special connection photograph by Nick Nichols this be a soap disco in Spain photograph by David Alan Harvey and David say that there be lot of weird stuff happen on the dance floor but hey at least it be hygienic laughter this be sea lion in Australia do they own dance by David Doubilet and this be a comet capture by Dr Euan Mason and finally the bow of the Titanic without movie star photograph by Emory Kristof Photography carry a power that hold up under the relentless swirl of today saturate media world because photograph emulate the way that we mind freeze a significant moment here be a example four year ago I be at the beach with my son and he be learn how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the Delaware beach but I turn away for a moment and he get catch into a riptide and start to be pull out towards the jetty I can stand here right now and see as I go tear into the water after he the moment slow down and freeze into this arrangement I can see the rock be over here there be a wave about to crash onto he I can see he hand reach out and I can see he face in terror look at I say help I Dad I get he the wave break over we we get back on shore he be fine we be a little bit rattled but this flashbulb memory as it be call be when all the element come together to define not just the event but my emotional connection to it and this be what a photograph tap into when it make its own powerful connection to a viewer now I have to tell you I be talk to Kyle last week about this that I be go to tell this story and he say oh yeah I remember that too I remember my image of you be that you be up on the shore yell at I laughter I think I be a hero laughter so this represent this be a cross sample of some remarkable image take by some of the world great photojournalist work at the very top of they craft except one this photograph be take by Dr Euan Mason in New Zealand last year and it be submit and publish in National Geographic last year we add a section to we website call you shoot where anyone can submit photograph for possible publication and it have become a wild success tap into the enthusiast photography community the quality of this amateur photograph can at time be amazing and see this reinforce for I that every one of we have at least one or two great photograph in they but to be a great photojournalist you have to have more than just one or two great photograph in you you have get to be able to make they all the time but even more importantly you need to know how to create a visual narrative you need to know how to tell a story so I be go to share with you some coverage that I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography photographer Nick Nichols go to document a very small and relatively unknown wildlife sanctuary in Chad call Zakouma the original intent be to travel there and bring back a classic story of diverse species of a exotic locale and that be what Nick do up to a point this be a serval cat he be actually take he own picture shot with what be call a camera trap there be a infrared beam that be go across and he have step into the beam and take he photograph this be baboon at a watering hole Nick the camera again a automatic camera take thousand of picture of this and Nick end up with a lot of picture of the rear end of baboon laughter a lion have a late night snack notice he be get a broken tooth and a crocodile walk up a riverbank toward its den I love this little bit of water that come off the back of he tail but the centerpiece species of Zakouma be the elephant it be one of the large intact herd in this part of Africa here be a photograph shot in moonlight something that digital photography have make a big difference for it be with the elephant that this story pivot Nick along with researcher Dr Michael Fay collar the matriarch of the herd they name she Annie and they begin track she movement the herd be safe within the confines of the park because of this dedicated group of park ranger but once the annual rain begin the herd would begin migrate to feed grounds outside the park and that be when they run into trouble for outside the safety of the park be poacher who would hunt they down only for the value of they ivory tusk the matriarch that they be radio tracking after week of move back and forth in and out of the park come to a halt outside the park Annie have be kill along with 20 member of she herd and they only come for the ivory this be actually one of the ranger they be able to chase off one of the poacher and recover this ivory because they could not leave it there because it be still valuable but what Nick do be he bring back a story that go beyond the old school method of just straight be not this a amazing world and instead create a story that touch we audience deeply instead of just knowledge of this park he create a understanding and a empathy for the elephant the ranger and the many issue surround human wildlife conflict now let go over to India sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way we be look at the same issue that Richard Wurman touch upon in he new world population project for the first time in history more person live in urban rather than rural environment and most of that growth be not in the city but in the slum that surround they Jonas Bendiksen a very energetic photographer come to I and say we need to document this and here be my proposal let go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world and I say well you know that might be a bit ambitious for we budget so instead what we do be we decide to instead of go out and do what would result in what we have consider sort of a survey story where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything we put Jonas into Dharavi which be part of Mumbai India and let he stay there and really get into the heart and soul of this really major part of the city what Jonas do be not just go and do a surface look at the awful condition that exist in such place he see that this be a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area function by stay tightly focus in one place Jonas tap into the soul and the endure human spirit that underlie this community and he do it in a beautiful way sometimes though the only way to tell a story be with a sweeping picture we team up underwater photographer Brian Skerry and photojournalist Randy Olson to document the depletion of the world fishery we be not the only one to tackle this subject but the photograph that Brian and Randy create be among the good to capture both the human and natural devastation of overfish here in a photo by Brian a seemingly crucify shark be catch up in a gill net off of Baja I have see sort of ok picture of bycatch the animal accidentally scoop up while fishing for a specific species but here Brian capture a unique view by position himself underneath the boat when they throw the waste overboard and Brian then go on to even great risk to get this never before make photograph of a trawl net scrape the ocean bottom back on land Randy Olson photograph a makeshift fish market in Africa where the remains of filleted fish be sell to the local the main part have already be send to Europe and here in China Randy shoot a jellyfish market as prime food source be deplete the harvest go deep into the ocean and bring in more such source of protein this be call fishing down the food chain but there be also glimmer of hope and I think anytime we be do a big big story on this we do not really want to go and just look at all the problem we also want to look for solution Brian photograph a marine sanctuary in New Zealand where commercial fishing have be ban the result be that the overfished species have be restore and with they a possible solution for sustainable fishery photography can also compel we to confront issue that be potentially distressing and controversial James Nachtwey who be honor at last year TED take a look at the sweep of the medical system that be utilize to handle the American wound come out of Iraq it be like a tube where a wounded soldier enter on one end and exit back home on the other Jim start in the battlefield here a medical technician tend to a wounded soldier on the helicopter ride back to the field hospital here be in the field hospital the soldier on the right have the name of he daughter tattoo across he chest as a reminder of home from here the more severely wound be transport back to Germany where they meet up with they family for the first time and then back to the States to recuperate at veteran hospital such as here in Walter Reed and finally often fit with high tech prosthesis they exit the medical system and attempt to regain they pre war live Jim take what could have be a straight up medical science story and give it a human dimension that touch we reader deeply now this story be great example of how photography can be use to address some of we most important topic but there be also time when photographer simply encounter thing that be when it come down to it just plain fun photographer Paul Nicklin travel to Antarctica to shoot a story on leopard seal they have be rarely photograph partly because they be consider one of the most dangerous predator in the ocean in fact a year early a researcher have be grab by one and pull down to depth and kill so you can imagine Paul be maybe a little bit hesitant about get into the water now what leopard seal do mostly be they eat penguin you know of the March of the Penguins this be sort of the munch of the penguin laughter here a penguin go up to the edge and look out to see if the coast be clear and then everybody kind of run out and go out but then Paul get in the water and he say he be never really afraid of this well this one female come up to he she be probably it be a shame you can not see it in the photograph but she be 12 foot long so she be pretty significant in size and Paul say he be never really afraid because she be more curious about he than threaten this mouthing behavior on the right be really she way of say to he hey look how big I be or you know my what big tooth you have laughter then Paul think that she simply take pity on he to she here be this big goofy creature in the water that for some reason do not seem to be interested in chase penguin so what she do be she start to bring penguin to he alive and put they in front of he she drop they off and then they would swim away she would kind of look at he like what be you do go back and get they and then bring they back and drop they in front of he and she do this over the course of a couple of day until the point where she get so frustrated with he that she start put they directly on top of he head laughter which just result in a fantastic photograph laughter eventually though Paul think that she just figure that he be never go to survive this be she just puff out you know snort out in disgust laughter and lose interest with he and go back to what she do good Paul set out to photograph a relatively mysterious and unknown creature and come back with not just a collection of photograph but a amazing experience and a great story it be this kind of story one that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial that demonstrate the power of photojournalism I believe that photography can make a real connection to person and can be employ as a positive agent for understand the challenge and opportunity face we world today thank you applause
