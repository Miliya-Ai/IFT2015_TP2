as you point out every time you come here you learn something this morning the world expert from I guess three or four different company on build seat I think conclude that ultimately the solution be person should not sit down I could have tell they that laughter yesterday the automotive guy give we some new insight they point out that I believe it be between 30 and 50 year from today they will be steer car by wire without all that mechanical stuff laughter that be reassuring applause they then point out that there would be sort of the other control by wire to get rid of all that mechanical stuff that be pretty good but why not get rid of the wire then you do not need anything to control the car except think about it I would love to talk about the technology and sometime in what be past the 15 minute I will be happy to talk to all the techno geek around here about what be in here but if I have one thing to say about this before we get to first it would be that from the time we start build this the big idea be not the technology it really be a big idea in technology when we start apply it in the ibot for the disabled community the big idea here be I think a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation and maybe to put that in perspective there be so much datum on this I will be happy to give it to you in different form you never know what strike the fancy of whom but everybody be perfectly willing to believe the car change the world and Henry Ford just about 100 year ago start crank out Model Ts what I do not think most person think about be the context of how technology be apply for instance in that time 91 percent of America live either on farm or in small town so the car the horseless carriage that replace the horse and carriage be a big deal it go twice as fast as a horse and carriage it be half as long and it be a environmental improvement because for instance in 1903 they outlaw horse and buggy in downtown Manhattan because you can imagine what the road look like when you have a million horse and a million of they urinate and do other thing and the typhoid and other problem create be almost unimaginable so the car be the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy it also be a way for person to get from they farm to a farm or they farm to a town or from a town to a city it all make sense with 91 percent of the person live there by the 1950 we start connect all the town together with what a lot of person claim be the eighth wonder of the world the highway system and it be certainly a wonder and by the way as I take shot at old technology I want to assure everybody and particularly the automotive industry who be be very supportive of we that I do not think this in any way compete with airplane or car but think about where the world be today 50 percent of the global population now live in city that be 3 2 billion person we have solve all the transportation problem that have change the world to get it to where we be today 500 year ago sail ship start get reliable enough we find a new continent 150 year ago locomotive get efficient enough steam power that we turn the continent into a country over the last hundred year we start build car and then over the 50 year we have connect every city to every other city in a extraordinarily efficient way and we have a very high standard of live as a consequence of that but during that entire process more and more person have be bear and more and more person be move to city China alone be go to move four to six hundred million person into city in the next decade and a half and so nobody I think would argue that airplane in the last 50 year have turn the continent and the country now into a neighborhood and if you just look at how technology have be apply we have solve all the long range high speed high volume large weight problem of move thing around nobody would want to give they up and I certainly would not want to give up my airplane or my helicopter or my Humvee or my Porsche I love they all I do not keep any of they in my living room the fact be the last mile be the problem and half the world now live in dense city and person spend depend on who they be between 90 and 95 percent of they energy get around on foot I think there be I do not know what datum would impress you but how about 43 percent of the refined fuel produce in the world be consume by car in metropolitan area in the United States three million person die every year in city due to bad air and almost all particulate pollution on this planet be produce by transportation device particularly sit in city and again I say that not to attack any industry I think I really do I love my airplane and car on highway move 60 mile a hour be extraordinarily efficient both from a engineering point of view a energy consumption point of view and a utility point of view and we all love we car and I do the problem be you get into the city and you want to go four block it be neither fun nor efficient nor productive it be not sustainable if in China in the year 1998 417 million person use bicycle 1 7 million person used car if five percent of that population become quote middle class and want to go the way we have go in the last hundred year at the same time that 50 percent of they population be move into city of the size and density of Manhattan every six week it be not sustainable environmentally it be not sustainable economically there just be not enough oil and it be not sustainable politically I mean what be we fight over right now we can make it complicated but what be the world fight over right now so it seem to I that somebody have to work on that last mile and it be dumb luck we be work on iBOTs but once we make this we instantly decide it could be a great alternative to jet ski you do not need the water or snowmobile you do not need the snow or skiing it be just fun and person love to move around do fun thing and every one of that industry by the way just golf cart alone be a multi billion dollar industry but rather than go license this off which be what we normally do it seem to I that if we put all we effort not into the technology but into a understanding of a world that be solve all its other problem but have somehow come to accept that city which right back from ancient Greece on be mean to walk around city that be architect and build for person now have a footprint that while we have solve every other transportation problem and it be like Moore law I mean look at the time it take to cross a continent in a Conestoga wagon then on a railroad then a airplane every other form of transportation be improve in 5 000 year we have go backwards in get around city they have get big they be spread out the most expensive real estate on this planet in every city Wilshire Boulevard or Fifth Avenue or Tokyo or Paris the most expensive real estate be they downtown 65 percent of the landmass of we city be park car the 20 large city in the world so you wonder what if city could give to they pedestrian what we take for grant as we now go between city what if you could make they fun attractive clean environmentally friendly what if it would make it a little bit more palatable to have access via this as that last link to mass transit to get out to you car so we can all live in the suburb and use we car the way we want and then have we city energize again we think it would be really neat to do that and one of the problem we really be worry about be how do we get legal on the sidewalk because technically I have get motor I have get wheel I be a motor vehicle I do not look like a motor vehicle I have the same footprint as a pedestrian I have the same unique capability to deal with other pedestrian in a crowded space I take this down to Ground Zero and knock my way through crowd for a hour I be a pedestrian but the law typically lag technology by a generation or two and if we get tell we do not belong on the sidewalk we have two choice we be a recreational vehicle that do not really matter and I do not spend my time do that kind of stuff or maybe we should be out in the street in front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle we have be so concerned about that we go to the Postmaster General of the United States as the first person we ever show on the outside and say put you person on it everybody trust they postman and they belong on the sidewalk and they will use it seriously he agree we go to a number of police department that want they police officer back in the neighborhood on the beat carry 70 pound of stuff they love it and I can not believe a policeman be go to give themselves a ticket laughter so we have be work really really hard but we know that the technology would not be as hard to develop as a attitude about what be important and how to apply the technology we go out and we find some visionary person with enough money to let we design and build this thing and in hopefully enough time to get they accept so I be happy really I be happy to talk about this technology as much as you want and yes it be really fun and yes you should all go out and try it but if I could ask you to do one thing it be not to think about it as a piece of technology but just imagine that although we all understand somehow that it be reasonable that we use we 4 000 pound machine which can go 60 mile a hour that can bring you everywhere you want to go and somehow it be also what we use for the last mile and it be break and it do not work one of the more exciting thing that occur to we about why it might get accept happen out here in California A few week ago after we launch it we be here with a news crew on Venice Beach zip up and back and he be marvel at the technology and meanwhile bicycle be zip by and skateboarder be zip by and a little old lady I mean if you look in the dictionary a little old lady come by I and now that I be on this I be the height of a normal adult now and she just stop and the camera be there and she look up at I and say can I try that and what be I you know how be you go to say anything and so I say sure so I get off and she get on and with a little bit of the usual ah then she turn around and she go about 20 foot and she turn back around and she be all smile and she come back to I and she stop and she say finally they make something for we and the camera be look down at she I be think wow that be great laughter please lady do not say another word laughter and the camera be down at she and this guy have to put the microphone in she face say what do you mean by that and I figure it be all over now and she look up and she say well she be still watch this guy go she say I can not ride a bike no she say I can not use a skateboard and I have never use roller blade she know they by name she say and it be be 50 year since I ride a bicycle then she look up she be look up and she say and I be 81 year old and I do not drive a car anymore I still have to get to the store and I can not carry a lot of thing and it suddenly occur to I that among my many fear be not just that the bureaucracy and the regulator and the legislator might not get it it be that fundamentally you believe there be pressure among the person not to invade the most precious little bit of space leave the sidewalk in this city when you look at the 36 inch of legal requirement for sidewalk then the eight foot for the park car then the three lane and then the other eight foot it be that little piece be all that be there but she look up and say this and it occur to I well kid be not go to mind this thing and they do not vote and business person and then young adult be not go to mind this thing they be pretty cool so I guess subliminally I be worry that it be the old population that be go to worry so have see this and have worry about it for eight year the first thing I do be pick up my phone and ask we marketing and regulatory guy call aarp get a appointment right away we have get to show they this thing and they take it to Washington they show they and they be go to be involve now watch how this thing get absorb in a number of city like Atlanta where we be do trial to see if it really can in fact help re energize they downtown applause the bottom line be whether you believe the United Nations or any of the other think tank in the next 20 year all human population growth on this planet will be in city in Asia alone it will be over a billion person they learn to start with cell phone they do not have to take the 100 year trip we take they start at the top of the technology food chain we have get to start build city and human environment where a 150 pound person can go a couple of mile in a dense rich green space environment without be in a 4 000 pound machine to do it car be not mean for parallel parking they be wonderful machine to go between city but just think about it we have solve all the long range high speed problem the Greek go from the theater of Dionysus to the Parthenon in they sandal you do it in you sneaker not much have change if this thing go only three time as fast as walk three time a 30 minute walk become 10 minute you choice when live in a city if it be now 10 minute because at 30 minute you want a alternative whether it be a bus a train we have get to build a infrastructure a light rail or you be go to keep parking that car but if you could put a pin in most city and imagine how far you could if you have the time walk in one half hour it be the city if you could make it fun and make it eight or 10 minute you can not find you car un park you car move you car re park you car and go somewhere you can not get to a cab or a subway we could change the way person allocate they resource the way this planet use its energy make it more fun and we be hope to some extent history will say we be right that be Segway this be a Stirling cycle engine this have be confuse by a lot of thing we be do this little beast right now be produce a few hundred watt of electricity yes it could be attach to this and yes on a kilogram of propane you could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose perhaps more interesting about this little engine be it will burn any fuel because some of you might be skeptical about the capability of this to have a impact where most of the world you can not simply plug into you 120 volt outlet we have be work on this actually as a alternative energy source start way back with Johnson Johnson to run a ibot because the good battery you could get 10 watt hour per kilogram in lead 20 watt hour per kilogram nickel cadmium 40 watt hour per kilogram in nickel metal hydride 60 watt hour per kilogram in lithium 8 750 watt hour of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline which be why nobody drive electric car but in any event if you can burn it with the same efficiency because it be external combustion as you kitchen stove if you can burn any fuel it turn out to be pretty neat it make just enough electricity to for instance do this which at night be enough electricity in the rest of the world as Mr Holly Dr Holly point out can run computer and a light bulb but more interestingly the thermodynamics of this say you be never go to get more than 20 percent efficiency it do not matter much it say if you get 200 watt of electricity you will get 700 or 800 watt of heat if you want to boil water and re condense it at a rate of 10 gallon a hour it take about 25 a little over 25 3 kilowatt 25 000 watt of continuous power to do it that be so much energy you could not afford to desalinate or clean water in this country that way certainly in the rest of the world you choice be to devastate the place turn everything that will burn into heat or drink the water that be available the number one cause of death on this planet among human be bad water depend on whose number you believe it be between 60 and 85 000 person per day we do not need sophisticated heart transplant around the world we need water and woman should not have to spend four hour a day look for it or watch they kid die we figure out how to put a vapor compression distiller on this thing with a counter flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat then use a little bit of the electricity control that process and for 450 watt which be a little more than half of its waste heat it will make 10 gallon a hour of distilled water from anything that come into it to cool it so if we put this box on here in a few year could we have a solution to transportation electricity and communication and maybe drinkable water in a sustainable package that weigh 60 pound I do not know but we will try it I well shut up applause
