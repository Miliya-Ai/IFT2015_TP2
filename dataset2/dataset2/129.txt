like many of you here I be try to contribute towards a renaissance in Africa the question of transformation in Africa really be a question of leadership Africa can only be transform by enlightened leader and it be my contention that the manner in which we educate we leader be fundamental to progress on this continent I want to tell you some story that explain my view we all hear about the importance of story yesterday a American friend of mine this year volunteer as a nurse in Ghana and in a period of three month she come to a conclusion about the state of leadership in Africa that have take I over a decade to reach twice she be involve in surgery where they lose power at the hospital the emergency generator do not start there be not a flashlight not a lantern not a candle pitch black the patient cut open twice the first time it be a c section thankfully baby be out mother and child survive the second time be a procedure that involve local anesthesia anesthetic wear off the patient feel pain he be cry he be scream he be pray Pitch black not a candle not a flashlight and that hospital could have afford flashlight they could have afford to purchase this thing but they do not and it happen twice another time she watch in horror as nurse watch a patient die because they refuse to give she oxygen that they have and so three month later just before she return to the United States nurse in Accra go on strike and she recommendation be take this opportunity to fire everyone start all over again start all over again now what do this have to do with leadership you see the folk at the ministry of health the hospital administrator the doctor the nurse they be among just five percent of they peer who get a education after secondary school they be the elite they be we leader they decision they action matter and when they fail a nation literally suffer so when I speak of leadership I be not talk about just political leader we have hear a lot about that I be talk about the elite that who have be train whose job it be to be the guardian of they society the lawyer the judge the policeman the doctor the engineer the civil servant that be the leader and we need to train they right now my first pointed and memorable experience with leadership in Ghana occur when I be 16 year old we have just have a military coup and soldier be pervasive in we society they be a pervasive presence and one day I go to the airport to meet my father and as I walk up this grassy slope from the car park to the terminal building I be stop by two soldier wield AK 47 assault weapon and they ask I to join a crowd of person that be run up and down this embankment why because the path I have take be consider out of bind no sign to this effect now I be 16 I be very worried about what my peer at school might think if they see I run up and down this hill I be especially concern of what the girl might think and so I start to argue with this man it be a little reckless but you know I be 16 I get lucky a Ghana Airways pilot fall into the same predicament because of he uniform they speak to he differently and they explain to he that they be just follow order so he take they radio talk to they boss and get we all release what lesson would you take from a experience like this several for I Leadership matter that man be follow the order of a superior officer I learn something about courage it be important not to look at that gun and I also learn that it can be helpful to think about girl laughter so a few year after this event I leave Ghana on a scholarship to go to Swarthmore College for my education it be a breath of fresh air you know the faculty there do not want we to memorize information and repeat back to they as I be use to back in Ghana they want we to think critically they want we to be analytical they want we to be concern about social issue in my economics class i get high mark for my understanding of basic economics but I learn something more profound than that which be that the leader the manager of Ghana economy be make breathtakingly bad decision that have bring we economy to the brink of collapse and so here be this lesson again leadership matter it matter a great deal but I do not really fully understand what have happen to I at Swarthmore I have a inkling but I do not fully realize it until I go out into the workplace and I go to work at Microsoft Corporation and I be part of this team this thinking learning team whose job it be to design and implement new software that create value in the world and it be brilliant to be part of this team it be brilliant and I realize just what have happen to I at Swarthmore this transformation the ability to confront problem complex problem and to design solution to that problem the ability to create be the most empowering thing that can happen to a individual and I be part of that now while I be at Microsoft the annual revenue of that company grow large than the gdp of the Republic of Ghana and by the way it be continue to the gap have widen since I leave now I have already speak about one of the reason why this have occur I mean it be the person there who be so hardworking persistent creative empower but there be also some external factor free market the rule of law infrastructure this thing be provide by institution run by the person that I call leader and that leader do not emerge spontaneously somebody train they to do the work that they do now while I be at Microsoft this funny thing happen I become a parent and for the first time Africa matter more to I than ever before because I realize that the state of the African continent would matter to my child and they child that the state of the world the state of the world depend on what be happen to Africa as far as my kid would be concerned and at this time when I be go through what I call my pre mid life crisis Africa be a mess somalia have disintegrate into anarchy Rwanda be in the throe of this genocidal war and it seem to I that that be the wrong direction and I need to be back help I could not just stay in Seattle and raise my kid in a upper middle class neighborhood and feel good about it this be not the world that I have want my child to grow up in so I decide to get engaged and the first thing that I do be to come back to Ghana and talk with a lot of person and really try to understand what the real issue be and three thing keep come up for every problem corruption weak institution and the person who run they the leader now I be a little scared because when you see that three problem they seem really hard to deal with and they might say look do not even try but for I I ask the question well where be this leader come from what be it about Ghana that produce leader that be unethical or unable to solve problem so I go to look at what be happen in we educational system and it be the same learning by rote from primary school through graduate school very little emphasis on ethic and the typical graduate from a university in Ghana have a strong sense of entitlement than a sense of responsibility this be wrong so I decide to engage this particular problem because it seem to I that every society every society must be very intentional about how it train its leader and Ghana be not pay enough attention and this be true across sub Saharan Africa actually so this be what I be do now I be try to bring the experience that I have at Swarthmore to Africa I wish there be a liberal art college in every African country I think it would make a huge difference and what Ashesi University be try to do be to train a new generation of ethical entrepreneurial leader we be try to train leader of exceptional integrity who have the ability to confront the complex problem ask the right question and come up with workable solution I will admit that there be time when it seem like Mission impossible but we must believe that this kid be smart that if we involve they in they education if we have they discuss the real issue that they confront that we whole society confront and if we give they skill that enable they to engage the real world that magic will happen now a month into this project we would just start class and a month into it I come to the office and I have this email from one of we student and it say very simply I be think now and he sign off thank you it be such a simple statement but I be move almost to tear because I understand what be happen to this young man and it be a awesome thing to be a part of empower someone in this way I be think now this year we challenge we student to craft a honor code themselves there be a very vibrant debate go on on campus now over whether they should have a honor code and if so what it should look like one of the student ask a question that just warm my heart can we create a perfect society she understand that a student craft honor code constitute a reach towards perfection be incredible now we can not achieve perfection but if we reach for it then we can achieve excellence I do not know ultimately what they will do I do not know whether they will decide to have this honor code but the conversation they be have now about what they good society should look like what they excellent society should look like be a really good thing be I out of time ok now I just want to leave that slide up because it be important that we think about it I be very excited about the fact that every student at Ashesi University do community service before they graduate that for many of they it have be a life alter experience this young future leader be begin to understand the real business of leadership the real privilege of leadership which be after all to serve humanity I be even more thrilled by the fact that least year we student body elect a woman to be the head of Student Government it be the first time in the history of Ghana that a woman have be elect head of Student Government at any university it say a lot about she it say a lot about the culture that be form on campus it say a lot about she peer who elect she she win with 75 percent of the vote and it give I a lot of hope it turn out that corporate West Africa also appreciate what be happen with we student we have graduate two class of student to date and every single one of they have be place and we be get great report back from corporate Ghana corporate West Africa and the thing that they be most impressed about be work ethic you know that passion for what they be do the persistence they ability to deal with ambiguity they ability to tackle problem that they have not see before this be good because over the past five year there have be time when I have feel this be Mission impossible and it be just wonderful to see this glimmer of the promise of what can happen if we train we kid right I think that the current and future leader of Africa have a incredible opportunity to drive a major renaissance on the continent it be a incredible opportunity there be not very many more opportunity like this in the world I believe that Africa have reach a inflection point with a march of democracy and free market across the continent we have reach a moment from which can emerge a great society within one generation it will depend on inspired leadership and it be my contention that the manner in which we train we leader will make all the difference thank you and God bless applause
