when you think about resilience and technology it be actually much easy you be go to see some other speaker today I already know who be go to talk about break bone stuff and of course with technology it never be so it be very easy comparatively speak to be resilient I think that if we look at what happen on the internet with such a incredible last half a dozen year that it be hard to even get the right analogy for it a lot of how we decide how we be suppose to react to thing and what we be suppose to expect about the future depend on how we bucket thing and how we categorize they and so I think the tempting analogy for the boom bust that we just go through with the internet be a gold rush it be easy to think of this analogy as very different from some of the other thing you might pick for one thing both be very real in 1849 in that gold rush they take over 700 million worth of gold out of California it be very real the internet be also very real this be a real way for human to communicate with each other it be a big deal huge boom huge boom huge bust huge bust you keep go and both thing be lot of hype I do not have to remind you of all the hype that be involve with the internet like GetRich com but you have the same thing with the Gold Rush Gold Gold Gold Sixty eight rich man on the Steamer Portland Stacks of yellow metal some have 5 000 many have more a few bring out 100 000 dollar each People would get very excited about this when they read this article the Eldorado of the United States of America the discovery of inexhaustible gold mine in California and the parallel between the gold rush and the internet rush continue very strongly so many person leave what they be do and what would happen be and the Gold Rush go on for year person on the East Coast in 1849 when they first start to get the news they think ah this be not real but they keep hear about person get rich and then in 1850 they still hear that and they think it be not real by about 1852 they be think be I the stupid person on Earth by not rush to California and they start to decide they be this be community affair by the way local community on the East Coast would get together and whole team of 10 20 person would caravan across the United States and they would form company this be typically not solitary effort but no matter what if you be a lawyer or a banker person drop what they be do no matter what skill set they have to go pan for gold this guy on the left Dr Richard Beverley Cole he live in Philadelphia and he take the Panama route they would take a ship down to Panama across the isthmus and then take another ship north this guy Dr Toland go by covered wagon to California this have its parallel too doctor leave they practice this be both very successful a physician in one case a surgeon in the other same thing happen on the Internet you get DrKoop com laughter in the Gold Rush person literally jump ship the San Francisco harbor be clog with 600 ship at the peak because the ship would get there and the crew would abandon to go search for gold so there be literally 600 captain and 600 ship they turn the ship into hotel because they could not sail they anywhere you have dotcom fever and you have gold fever and you see some of the excess that the dotcom fever create and the same thing happen the fort in San Francisco at the time have about 1 300 soldier half of they desert to go look for gold and they would not let the other half out to go look for the first half because they be afraid they would not come back laughter and one of the soldier write home and this be the sentence that he put the struggle between right and six dollar a month and wrong and 75 dollar a day be a rather severe one they have bad burn rate in the Gold Rush A very bad burn rate this be actually from the Klondike Gold Rush this be the White Pass Trail they load up they mule and they horse and they do not plan right and they do not know how far they would really have to go and they overload the horse with hundred and hundred of pound of stuff in fact it be so bad that most of the horse die before they could get where they be go it get rename the dead horse trail and the Canadian Minister of the Interior write this at the time thousand of pack horse lie dead along the way sometimes in bunch under the cliff with pack saddle and pack where they have fall from the rock above sometimes in tangled mass fill the mud hole and furnishing the only footing for we poor pack animal on the march often I regret to say exhausted but still alive a fact we be unaware of until after the miserable wretch turn beneath the hoof of we cavalcade the eyeless socket of the pack animal everywhere account for the myriad of raven along the road the inhumanity which this trail have be witness to the heartbreak and suffering which so many have undergo can not be imagine they certainly can not be describe and you know without the smell that would have accompany that we have the same thing on the internet very bad burn rate calculation I will just play one of this and you will remember it this be a commercial that be play on the Super Bowl in the year 2000 video bride 1 you say you have a large selection of invitation Clerk but we do bride 2 then why do she have my invitation announcer what may be a little thing to some bride 3 you be mine little man announcer could be a really big deal to you Husband 1 be that you wife Husband 2 not for another 15 minute announcer after all it be you special day ourbeginning com life be a event announce it to the world Jeff Bezos it be very difficult to figure out what that ad be for laughter but they spend three and a half million dollar in the 2000 Super Bowl to air that ad even though at the time they only have a million dollar in annual revenue now here be where we analogy with the gold rush start to diverge and I think rather severely and that be in a gold rush when it be over it be over here be this guy there be many man in Dawson at the present time who feel keenly disappointed they have come thousand of mile on a perilous trip risk life health and property spend month of the most arduous labor a man can perform and at length with expectation raise to the high pitch have reach the coveted goal only to discover the fact that there be nothing here for they and that be of course the very common story because when you take out that last piece of gold and they do incredibly quickly I mean if you look at the 1849 gold rush the entire American river region within two year every stone have be turn and after that only big company who use more sophisticated mining technology start to take gold out of there so there be a much good analogy that allow you to be incredibly optimistic and that analogy be the electric industry and there be a lot of similarity between the internet and the electric industry with the electric industry you actually have to one of they be that they be both sort of thin horizontal enable layer that go across lot of different industry it be not a specific thing but electricity be also very very broad so you have to sort of narrow it down you know it can be use as a incredible means of transmit power it be a incredible means of coordinate in a very fine grained way information flow there be a bunch of thing that be interesting about electricity and the part of the electric revolution that I want to focus on be sort of the golden age of appliance the killer app that get the world ready for appliance be the light bulb so the light bulb be what wire the world and they be not think about appliance when they wire the world they be really think about they be not put electricity into the home they be put lighting into the home and but it really it get the electricity it take a long time this be a huge as you would expect a huge capital build out all the street have to be tear up this be work go on down in low Manhattan where they build some of the first electric power generate station and they be tear up all the street the Edison Electric Company which become Edison General Electric which become General Electric pay for all of this dig up of the street it be incredibly expensive but that be not the and that be not the part that be really most similar to the web because remember the web get to stand on top of all this heavy infrastructure that have be put in place because of the long distance phone network so all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure I be go back now to sort of the explosive part of the web in 1994 when it be grow 2 300 percent a year how could it grow at 2 300 percent a year in 1994 when person be not really invest in the web well it be because that heavy infrastructure have already be lay down so the light bulb lay down the heavy infrastructure and then home appliance start come into be and this be huge the first one be the electric fan this be the 1890 electric fan and the appliance the golden age of appliance really last it depend how you want to measure it but it be anywhere from 40 to 60 year it go on a long time it start about 1890 and the electric fan be a big success the electric iron also very big by the way this be the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit laughter there be asbestos under that handle there this be the first vacuum cleaner the 1905 Skinner Vacuum from the Hoover Company and this one weigh 92 pound and take two person to operate and cost a quarter of a car so it be not a big seller this be truly truly a early adopter product laughter the 1905 Skinner Vacuum but three year later by 1908 it weigh 40 pound now not all this thing be highly successful laughter this be the electric tie press which never really do catch on person I guess decide that they would not wrinkle they tie this never really catch on either the electric shoe warm and dry never a big seller this come in like six different color laughter I do not know why but I think you know sometimes it be just not the right time for a invention maybe it be time to give this one another shot so I think we could build a Super Bowl ad for this we would need the right partner and I think that really laughter I think that would really work to give that another shot now the toaster be huge because they use to make toast on open fire and it take a lot of time and attention I want to point out one thing this be you guy know what this be they have not invent the electric socket yet so this be remember they do not wire the house for electricity they wire they for light so you you appliance would plug in they would each room typically have a light bulb socket at the top and you would plug it in there in fact if you have see the Carousel of Progress at Disney World you have see this here be the cable come up into this light fixture all the appliance plug in there and you would just unscrew you light bulb if you want to plug in a appliance the next thing that really be a big big deal be the washing machine now this be a object of much envy and lust everybody want one of this electric washing machine on the left hand side this be the soapy water and there be a rotor there that this motor be spin and it would clean you clothes this be the clean rinse water so you would take the clothes out of here put they in here and then you would run the clothes through this electric wringer and this be a big deal you would keep this on you porch it be a little bit messy and kind of a pain and you would run a long cord into the house where you could screw it into you light socket laughter and that be actually kind of a important point in my presentation because they have not invent the off switch that be to come much later the off switch on appliance because it do not make any sense I mean you do not want this thing clog up a light socket so you know when you be do with it you unscrew it that be what you do you do not turn it off and as I say before they have not invent the electric outlet either so the washing machine be a particularly dangerous device and there be when you research this there be gruesome description of person get they hair and clothes catch in this device and they could not yank the cord out because it be screw into a light socket inside the house laughter and there be no off switch so it be not very good and you might think that that be incredibly stupid of we ancestor to be plug thing into a light socket like this but you know before I get too far into condemn we ancestor I think I would show you this be my conference room this be a total kludge if you ask I first of all this get install upside down this light socket laughter and so the cord keep fall out so I tape it in laughter this be suppose do not even get I start but that be not the bad one this be what it look like under my desk I take this picture just two day ago so we really have not progress that much since 1908 laughter it be a total total mess and you know we think it be get good but have you try to install 802 11 yourself laughter I challenge you to try it be very hard I know ph d s in Computer Science this process have bring they to tear absolute tear laughter and that be assume you already have dsl in you house try to get dsl install in you house the engineer who do it everyday can not do it they have to typically they come three time and one friend of mine be tell I a story not only do they get there and have to wait but then the engineer when they finally do get there for the third time they have to call somebody and they be really happy that the guy have a speakerphone because then they have to wait on hold for a hour to talk to somebody to give they a access code after they get there so we be not we be pretty kludge y ourselves by the way dsl be a kludge I mean this be a twisted pair of copper that be never design for the purpose it be be put to you know it be the whole thing we be very very primitive and that be kind of the point because you know resilience if you think of it in term of the Gold Rush then you would be pretty depressed right now because the last nugget of gold would be go but the good thing be with innovation there be not a last nugget every new thing create two new question and two new opportunity and if you believe that then you believe that where we be this be what I think I believe that where we be with the incredible kludge and I have not even talk about user interface on the web but there be so much kludge so much terrible stuff we be at the 1908 Hurley wash machine stage with the internet that be where we be we do not get we hair catch in it but that be the level of primitiveness of where we be we be in 1908 and if you believe that then stuff like this do not bother you this be 1996 all the negative add up to make the online experience not worth the trouble 1998 Amazon toast in 1999 Amazon bomb my mom hate this picture laughter she but you know if you really do believe that it be the very very begin if you believe it be the 1908 Hurley wash machine then you be incredibly optimistic and I do think that that be where we be and I do think there be more innovation ahead of we than there be behind we and in 1917 Sears I want to get this exactly right this be the advertisement that they run in 1917 it say use you electricity for more than light and I think that be where we be we be very very early thank you very much
