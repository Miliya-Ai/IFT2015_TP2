the story we tell about each other matter very much the story we tell ourselves about we own life matter and most of all I think the way that we participate in each other story be of deep importance I be six year old when I first hear story about the poor now I do not hear that story from the poor themselves I hear they from my Sunday school teacher and Jesus kind of via my Sunday school teacher I remember learn that person who be poor need something material food clothing shelter that they do not have and I also be teach couple with that that it be my job this classroom full of five and six year old child it be we job apparently to help this be what Jesus ask of we and then he say what you do for the least of this you do for I now I be pretty psych I be very eager to be useful in the world I think we all have that feeling and also it be kind of interesting that God need help that be news to I and it feel like it be a very important thing to get to participate in but I also learn very soon thereafter that Jesus also say and I be paraphrase the poor would always be with we this frustrated and confuse I I feel like I have be just give a homework assignment that I have to do and I be excited to do but no matter what I would do I would fail so I feel confuse a little bit frustrated and angry like maybe I have misunderstand something here and I feel overwhelmed and for the first time I begin to fear this group of person and to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of person I imagine in my head a kind of long line of individual that be never go away that would always be with we they be always go to ask I to help they and give they thing which I be excited to do but I do not know how it be go to work and I do not know what would happen when I run out of thing to give especially if the problem be never go away in the year follow the other story I hear about the poor grow up be no more positive for example I see picture and image frequently of sadness and suffering I hear about thing that be go wrong in the life of the poor I hear about disease I hear about war they always seem to be kind of related and in general I get this sort of idea that the poor in the world live life that be work with suffering and sadness devastation hopelessness and after a while I develop what I think many of we do be this predictable response where I start to feel bad every time I hear about they I start to feel guilty for my own relative wealth because I be not do more apparently to make thing well and I even feel a sense of shame because of that and so naturally I start to distance myself I stop listen to they story quite as closely as I have before and I stop expect thing to really change now I still give on the outside it look like I be still quite involved I give of my time and my money I give when solution be on sale the cost of a cup of coffee can save a child life right I mean who can argue with that I give when I be cornered when it be difficult to avoid and I give in general when the negative emotion build up enough that I give to relieve my own suffering not someone else the truth be tell I be give out of that place not out of a genuine place of hope and excitement to help and of generosity it become a transaction for I become sort of a trade I be purchase something I be buy my right to go on with my day and not necessarily be bother by this bad news and I think the way that we go through that sometimes can first of all disembody a group of person individual out there in the world and it can also turn into a commodity which be a very scary thing so as I do this and as I think many of we do this we kind of buy we distance we kind of buy we right to go on with we day I think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most it can get in the way of we desire to really be meaningful and useful in another person life and in short to love thankfully a few year ago thing shift for I because I hear this gentleman speak Dr Muhammad Yunus I know many in the room probably know exactly who he be but to give the shorthand version for any who have not hear he speak Dr Yunus win the Nobel Peace Prize a few year ago for he work pioneer modern microfinance when I hear he speak it be three year before that but basically microfinance if this be new to you as well think of that as financial service for the poor think of all the thing you get at you bank and imagine that product and service tailor to the need of someone live on a few dollar a day Dr Yunus share he story explain what that be and what he have do with he Grameen Bank he also talk about in particular microlending which be a tiny loan that could help someone start or grow a business now when I hear he speak it be exciting for a number of reason first and foremost I learn about this new method of change in the world that for once show I maybe a way to interact with someone and to give to share of a resource in a way that be not weird and do not make I feel bad that be exciting but more importantly he tell story about the poor that be different than any story I have hear before in fact that individual he talk about who be poor be sort of a side note he be talk about strong smart hardworking entrepreneur who wake up every day and be do thing to make they life and they family life good all they need to do that more quickly and to do it well be a little bit of capital it be a amazing sort of insight for I and I in fact be so deeply move by this it be hard to express now how much that affect I but I be so move that I actually quit my job a few week later and I move to East Africa to try to see for myself what this be about for the first time actually in a long time I want to meet that individual I want to meet this entrepreneur and see for myself what they life be actually about so I spend three month in Kenya Uganda and Tanzania interview entrepreneur that have receive 100 dollar to start or grow a business and in fact through that interaction for the first time I be start to get to be friend with some of that person in that big amorphous group out there that be suppose to be far away I be start to be friend and get to know they personal story and over and over again as I interview they and spend my day with they I do hear story of life change and amazing little detail of change so I would hear from goat herder who have use that money that they have receive to buy a few more goat they business trajectory would change they would make a little bit more money they standard of live would shift and would get good and they would make really interesting little adjustment in they life like they would start to send they child to school they might be able to buy mosquito net maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure maybe it be just that they could put sugar in they tea and offer that to I when I come as they guest and that make they feel proud but there be this beautiful detail even if I talk to 20 goat herder in a row and some day that be what happen this beautiful detail of life change that be meaningful to they that be another thing that really touch I it be really humbling to see for the first time to really understand that even if I could have take a magic wand and fix everything I probably would have get a lot wrong because the good way for person to change they life be for they to have control and to do that in a way that they believe be good for they so I see that and it be very humbling anyway another interesting thing happen while I be there I never once be ask for a donation which have kind of be my mode right there be poverty you give money to help no one ask I for a donation in fact no one want I to feel bad for they at all if anything they just want to be able to do more of what they be do already and to build on they own capability so what I do hear once in a while be that person want a loan I think that sound very reasonable and really exciting and by the way I be a philosophy and poetry major in school so I do not know the difference between profit and revenue when I go to East Africa I just get this impression that the money would work and my introduction to business be in this 100 little infuse of capital and I learn about profit and revenue about leverage all sort of thing from farmer from seamstress from goat herder so this idea that this new story of business and hope might be share with my friend and family and through that maybe we could get some of the money that they need to be able to continue they business as loan that be this little idea that turn into Kiva A few month later I go back to Uganda with a digital camera and a basic website that my partner Matthew and I have kind of build and take picture of seven of my new friend post they story this story of entrepreneurship up on the website spam friend and family and say we think this be legal have not hear back yet from SEC on all the detail but do you say do you want to help participate in this provide the money that they need the money come in basically overnight we send it over to Uganda and over the next six month a beautiful thing happen the entrepreneur receive the money they be pay and they business in fact grow and they be able to support themselves and change the trajectory of they life in October of 05 after that first seven loan be pay Matt and I take the word beta off of the site we say we little experiment have be a success let start for real that be we official launch and then that first year October 05 through 06 Kiva facilitate 500 000 in loan the second year it be a total of 15 million the third year the total be up to around 40 the fourth year we be just short of 100 and today less than five year in Kiva facilitate more than 150 million dollar in little 25 dollar bit from lender and entrepreneur more than a million of that collectively in 200 country so that be where Kiva be today just to bring you right up to the present and while that number and that statistics be really fun to talk about and they be interesting to I Kiva really about story it be about retell the story of the poor and it be about give ourselves a opportunity to engage that validate they dignity validate a partnership relationship not a relationship that be base on the traditional sort of donor beneficiary weirdness that can happen but instead a relationship that can promote respect and hope and this optimism that together we can move forward so what I hope be that not only can the money keep flow forth through Kiva that be a very positive and meaningful thing but I hope Kiva can blur that line like I say between the traditional rich and poor category that we be teach to see in the world this false dichotomy of we and they have and have not I hope that Kiva can blur that line because as that happen I think we can feel free to interact in a way that be more open more just and more creative to engage with each other and to help each other imagine how you feel when you see somebody on street who be beg and you be about to approach they imagine how you feel and then imagine the difference when you might see somebody who have a story of entrepreneurship and hard work who want to tell you about they business maybe they be smile and they want to talk to you about what they have do imagine if you be speak with somebody who be grow thing and make they flourish somebody who be use they talent to do something productive somebody who be build they own business from scratch someone who be surround by abundance not scarcity who be in fact create abundance somebody with full hand with something to offer not empty hand ask for you to give they something imagine if you could hear a story you do not expect of somebody who wake up every day and work very very hard to make they life good this story can really change the way that we think about each other and if we can catalyze a supportive community to come around this individual and to participate in they story by lend a little bit of money I think that can change the way we believe in each other and each other potential now for I Kiva be just the beginning and as I look forward to what be next it be be helpful to reflect on the thing I have learn so far the first one be as I mention entrepreneurship be a new idea to I Kiva borrower as I interview they and get to know they over the last few year have teach I what entrepreneurship be and I think at its core it be decide that you want you life to be good you see a opportunity and you decide what you be go to do to try to seize that in short it be decide that tomorrow can well than today and go after that second thing that I have learn be that loan be a very interesting tool for connectivity so they be not a donation yeah maybe it do not sound that much different but in fact when you give something to someone and they say thanks and let you know how thing go that be one thing when you lend they money and they slowly pay you back over time you have this excuse to have a ongoing dialogue this continue attention this ongoing attention be a really big deal to build different kind of relationship among we and then third from what I have hear from the entrepreneur I have get to know when all else be equal give the option to have just money to do what you need to do or money plus the support and encouragement of a global community person choose the community plus the money that be a much more meaningful combination a more powerful combination so with that in mind this particular incident have lead to the thing that I be work on now I see entrepreneur everywhere now now that I be tune into this and one thing that I have see be there be a lot of supportive community that already exist in the world with social network it be a amazing way grow the number of person that we all have around we in we own supportive community rapidly and so as I have be think about this I have be wonder how can we engage this supportive community to catalyze even more entrepreneurial idea and to catalyze all of we to make tomorrow good than today as I have research what be go on in the United States a few interesting little insight have come up so one be that of course as we all might expect many small business in the U S and all over the world still need money to grow and to do more of what they want to do or they might need money during a hard month but there be always a need for resource close by another thing be it turn out that resource do not usually come from the place you might expect bank venture capitalist other organization and support structure they come from friend and family some statistics say 85 percent or more of funding for small business come from friend and family that be around 130 billion dollar a year it be a lot and third so as person be do this friend and family fundraising process it be very awkward person do not know exactly what to ask for how to ask what to promise in return even though they have the good of intention and want to thank that person that be support they so to harness the power of this supportive community in a new way and to allow entrepreneur to decide for themselves exactly what that financial exchange should look like exactly what fit they and the person around they this week actually we be quietly do a launch of Profounder which be a crowd funding platform for small business to raise what they need through investment from they friend and family and it be investment not donation not loan but investment that have a dynamic return so the mapping of participate in the story it actually flow with the up and down so in short it be a do it yourself tool for small business to raise this fund and what you can do be go onto the site create a profile create investment term in a really easy way we make it really really simple for I as well as anyone else who want to use the site and we allow entrepreneur to share a percentage of they revenue they can raise up to a million dollar from a unlimited number of unaccredited unsophisticated investor everyday person heaven forbid and they can share that return over time again whatever term they set as investor choose to become involved base on that term they can either take they reward back as cash or they can decide in advance to give that return away to a non profit so they can be a cash or a cause investor it be my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who have a idea a path to go do what they want to do in the world and to gather the person around they that they already have the person that know they good and that love they and want to support they to gather they to make this happen so that be what I be work on now and to close I just want to say look this be tool right now Profounder right at the very beginning and it be very palpable it be very clear to I that it be just a vessel it be just a tool what we need be for person to care to actually go use it just like they have care enough to use Kiva to make that connection but the good news be I do not think I need to stand here and convince you to care I be not even go to try I do not think even though we often hear you know hear the ethical and moral reason the religious reason here be why care and give will make you happy I do not think we need to be convince of that I think we know in fact I think we know so much and it be such a reality that we care so deeply that in fact what usually stop we be that we be afraid to try and to mess up because we care so very much about help each other and be meaningful in each other life so what I think I can do today that good thing I can give you I have give you my story which be the good I can do and I think I can remind we that we do care I think we all already know that and I think we know that love be resilient enough for we to get out there and try just a sec applause thanks applause thanks applause for I the good way to be inspire to try be to stop and to listen to someone else story and I be grateful that I have get to do that here at TED and I be grateful that whenever I do that guarantee I be inspire I be inspire by the person I be listen to and I believe more and more every time I listen in that that person potential to do great thing in the world and in my own potential to maybe help and that forget the tool forget the move around of resource that stuff easy believing in each other really be sure when push come to shove that each one of we can do amazing thing in the world that be what can make we story into love story and we collective story into one that continually perpetuate hope and good thing for all of we so that this belief in each other know that without a doubt and practice that every day in whatever you do that be what I believe will change the world and make tomorrow good than today thank you applause
