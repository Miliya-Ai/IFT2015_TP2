I spend the good part of a decade look at American response to mass atrocity and genocide and I would like to start by share with you one moment that to I sum up what there be to know about American and democratic response to mass atrocity and that moment come on April 21 1994 so 14 year ago almost in the middle of the Rwandan genocide in which 800 000 person would be systematically exterminate by the Rwandan government and some extremist militia on April 21 in the New York Times the paper report that somewhere between 200 000 and 300 000 person have already be kill in the genocide it be in the paper not on the front page it be a lot like the Holocaust coverage it be bury in the paper Rwanda itself be not see as newsworthy and amazingly genocide itself be not see as newsworthy but on April 21 a wonderfully honest moment occur and that be that a American congresswoman name Patricia Schroeder from Colorado meet with a group of journalist and one of the journalist say to she what be up what be go on in the U S government two to 300 000 person have just be exterminate in the last couple of week in Rwanda it be two week into the genocide at that time but of course at that time you do not know how long it be go to last and the journalist say why be there so little response out of Washington why no hearing no denunciation no person get arrest in front of the Rwandan embassy or in front of the White House what be the deal and she say she be so honest she say it be a great question all I can tell you be that in my congressional office in Colorado and my office in Washington we be get hundred and hundred of call about the endanger ape and gorilla population in Rwanda but nobody be call about the person the phone just be not ring about the person and the reason I give you this moment be there be a deep truth in it and that truth be or be in the 20th century that while we be begin to develop endangered species movement we do not have a endangered person movement we have Holocaust education in the school most of we be groom not only on image of nuclear catastrophe but also on image and knowledge of the Holocaust there be a museum of course on the Mall in Washington right next to Lincoln and Jefferson I mean we have own never again culturally appropriately interestingly and yet the politicization of never again the operationalization of never again have never occur in the 20th century and that be what that moment with Patricia Schroeder I think show that if we be to bring about a end to the world bad atrocity we have to make it such there have to be a role there have to be the creation of political noise and political cost in response to massive crime against humanity and so forth so that be the 20th century now here and this will be a relief to you at this point in the afternoon there be good news amazing news in the 21st century and that be that almost out of nowhere there have come into be a anti genocide movement a anti genocide constituency and one that look destine in fact to be permanent it grow up in response to the atrocity in Darfur it be comprise of student there be something like 300 anti genocide chapter on college campus around the country it be big than the anti apartheid movement there be something like 500 high school chapter devote to stop the genocide in Darfur Evangelical have join it Jewish group have join it Hotel Rwanda watcher have join it it be a cacophonous movement to call it a movement as with all movement perhaps be a little misleading it be diverse it be get a lot of different approach it be get all the up and the downs of movement but it have be amazingly successful in one regard in that it have become it have congeal into this endangered person movement that be miss in the 20th century it see itself such as it be the it as something that will create the impression that there will be political cost there will be a political price to be pay for allow genocide for not have a heroic imagination for not be a upstander but for be in fact a bystander now because it be student drive there be some amazing thing that the movement have do they have launch a divestment campaign that have now convince I think 55 university in 22 state to divest they holding of stock with regard to company do business in Sudan they have a 1 800 genocide number this be go to sound very kitsch but for that of you who may not be I mean may be apolitical but interested in do something about genocide you dial 1 800 genocide and you type in you zip code and you do not even have to know who you congressperson be it will refer you directly to you congressperson to you u s senator to you governor where divestment legislation be pend they have lower the transaction cost of stop genocide I think the most innovative thing they have introduce recently be genocide grade and it take student to introduce genocide grade so what you now have when a Congress be in session be member of Congress call up this 19 year old or 24 year old and say I be just tell I have a d minus on genocide what do I do to get a c I just want to get a c help I and the student and the other who be part of this incredibly energized base be there to answer that and there be always something to do now what this movement have do be it have extract from the Bush administration from the United States at a time of massive over stretch military financial diplomatic a whole series of commitment to Darfur that no other country in the world be make for instance the referral of the crime in Darfur to the International Criminal Court which the Bush administration do not like the expenditure of 3 billion dollar in refugee camp to try to keep basically the person who have be displace from they home by the Sudanese government by the so call Janjaweed the militia to keep that person alive until something more durable can be achieve and recently or now not that recently about six month ago the authorization of a peacekeeping force of 26 000 that will go and that be all the Bush administration leadership and it be all because of this bottom up pressure and the fact that the phone have not stop ring from the beginning of this crisis the bad news however to this question of will evil prevail be that evil life on the person in that camp be surround on all side by so call Janjaweed this man on horseback with spear and Kalashnikovs Women who go to get firewood in order to heat the humanitarian aid in order to feed they family humanitarian aid the dirty secret of it be it have to be heated really to be edible be themselves subject to rape which be a tool of the genocide that be be use and the peacekeeper I have mention the force have be authorize but almost no country on Earth have step forward since the authorization to actually put its troops or its police in harm way so we have achieve a awful lot relative to the 20th century and yet far too little relative to the gravity of the crime that be unfold as we sit here as we speak why the limit to the movement why be what have be achieve or what the movement have do be necessary but not sufficient to the crime I think there be a couple there be many reason but a couple just to focus on briefly the first be that the movement such as it be stop at America border it be not a global movement it do not have too many compatriot abroad who themselves be ask they government to do more to stop genocide and the Holocaust culture that we have in this country make American sort of more prone to I think want to bring never again to life the guilt that the Clinton administration express that Bill Clinton express over Rwanda create a space in we society for a consensus that Rwanda be bad and wrong and we wish we have do more and that be something that the movement have take advantage of European government for the most part have not acknowledge responsibility and there be nothing to kind of to push back and up against so this movement if it be to be durable and global will have to cross border and you will have to see other citizen in democracy not simply rest on the assumption that they government would do something in the face of genocide but actually make it such government will never gravitate towards crime of this magnitude naturally or eagerly as we see they have not even gravitate towards protect we port or reign in loose nuke why would we expect in a bureaucracy that it would orient itself towards distant suffering so one reason be it have not go global the second be of course that at this time in particular in America history we have a credibility problem a legitimacy problem in international institution it be structurally really really hard to do as the Bush administration rightly do which be to denounce genocide on a Monday and then describe water boarding on a Tuesday as a no brainer and then turn up on Wednesday and look for troop commitment now other country have they own reason for not want to get involved let I be clear they be in some way use the Bush administration as a alibi but it be essential for we to be a leader in this sphere of course to restore we standing and we leadership in the world the recovery be go to take some time we have to ask ourselves what now what do we do go forward as a country and as citizen in relationship to the world bad place the world bad suffering killer and the kind of killer that could come home to roost sometime in the future the place that I turn to answer that question be to a man that many of you may not have ever hear of and that be a Brazilian name Sergio Vieira de Mello who as Chris say be blow up in Iraq in 2003 he be the victim of the first ever suicide bomb in Iraq it be hard to remember but there be actually a time in the summer of 2003 even after the U S invasion where apart from loot civilian be relatively safe in Iraq now who be Sergio Sergio Vieira de Mello be he name in addition to be Brazilian he be describe to I before I meet he in 1994 as someone who be a cross between James Bond on the one hand and Bobby Kennedy on the other and in the u n you do not get that many person who actually manage to merge that quality he be James Bond like in that he be ingenious he be draw to the flame he chase the flame he be like a moth to the flame something of a adrenalin junkie he be successful with woman he be Bobby Kennedy like because in some way one could never tell if he be a realist masquerade as a idealist or a idealist masquerade as a realist as person always wonder about Bobby Kennedy and John Kennedy in that way what he be be a decathlete of nation building of problem solve of troubleshoot in the world bad place and in the world most broken place in fail state genocidal state under govern state precisely the kind of place that threat to this country exist on the horizon and precisely the kind of place where most of the world suffering tend to get concentrated this be the place he be draw to he move with the headline he be in the u n for 34 year he join at the age of 21 start off when the cause in the war du jour in the 70 be war of independence and decolonization he be there in Bangladesh deal with the outflow of million of refugee the large refugee flow in history up to that point he be in Sudan when the civil war break out there he be in Cyprus right after the Turkish invasion he be in Mozambique for the War of Independence he be in Lebanon amazingly he be in Lebanon the U N base be use Palestinian stage attack out from behind the u n base Israel then invade and overrun the u n base Sergio be in Beirut when the U S Embassy be hit by the first ever suicide attack against the United States People date the beginning of this new era to 9 11 but surely 1983 with the attack on the US Embassy and the Marine barracks which Sergio witness that be in fact in some way the dawn of the era that we find ourselves in today from Lebanon he go to Bosnia in the 90 the issue be of course ethnic sectarian violence he be the first person to negotiate with the Khmer Rouge talk about evil prevail I mean here he be in the room with the embodiment of evil in Cambodia he negotiate with the Serbs he actually cross so far into this realm of talk to evil and try to convince evil that it do not need to prevail that he earn the nickname not Sergio but Serbio while he be live in the Balkans and conduct this kind of negotiation he then go to Rwanda and to Congo in the aftermath of the genocide and he be the guy who have to decide huh ok the genocide be over 800 000 person have be kill the person responsible be flee into neighboring country into Congo into Tanzania I be Sergio I be a humanitarian and I want to feed that well I do not want to feed the killer but I want to feed the two million person who be with they so we be go to go we be go to set up camp and we be go to supply humanitarian aid but uh oh the killer be within the camp well I would like to separate the sheep from the wolf let I go door to door to the international community and see if anybody will give I police or troops to do the separation and they response of course be no more than we want to stop the genocide and put we troops in harm way to do that nor do we now want to get in the way and pluck genocidaire from camp so then you have to make the decision do you turn off the international spigot of life support and risk two million civilian life or do you continue feed the civilian know that the genocidaire be in the camp literally sharpen they knife for future battle what do you do it be all less evil terrain in this broken place late 90 nation building be the cause du jour he be the guy put in charge he be the Paul Bremer or the Jerry Bremer of first Kosovo and then East Timor he govern the place he be the viceroy he have to decide on tax policy on currency on border patrol on police he have to make all this judgment he be a Brazilian in this place he speak seven language he be be up to that point in 14 war zone so he be position to make good judgment perhaps than person who have never do that kind of work but nonetheless he be the cut edge of we experimentation with do good with very few resource be bring to bear in again the world bad place and then after Timor 9 11 have happen he be name U N Human Rights Commissioner and he have to balance liberty and security and figure out what do you do when the most powerful country in the United Nations be bow out of the Geneva Conventions bow out of international law do you denounce well if you denounce you be probably never go to get back in the room maybe you stay reticent maybe you try to charm President Bush and that be what he do and in so do he earn himself unfortunately he final and tragic appointment to Iraq the one that result in he death one note on he death which be so devastating be that despite predicate the war on Iraq on a link between Saddam Hussein and terrorism in 9 11 believe it or not the Bush administration or the invader do no planning no pre war planning to respond to terrorism so Sergio this receptacle of all of this learning on how to deal with evil and how to deal with brokenness lay under the rubble for three and a half hour without rescue stateless the guy who try to help the stateless person he whole career like a refugee because he represent the u n if you represent everyone in some way you represent no one you be un own and what the American the most powerful military in the history of mankind be able to muster for he rescue believe it or not be literally this heroic two American soldier go into the shaft building be shake one of they have be at 9 11 and lose he buddy on September 11th and yet go in and risk he life in order to save Sergio but all they have be a woman handbag literally one of that basket handbag and they tie it to a curtain rope from one of the office at U N headquarters and create a pulley system into this shaft in this quiver building in the interest of rescue this person the person we most need to turn to now this shepherd at a time when so many of we feel like we be lack guidance and this be the pulley system this be what we be able to muster for Sergio the good news for what it be worth be after Sergio and 21 other be kill that day in the attack on the U N the military create a search and rescue unit that have the cutting equipment the shore wood the crane the thing that you would have need to do the rescue but it be too late for Sergio I want to wrap up but I want to close with what I take to be the four lesson from Sergio life on this question of how do we prevent evil from prevail which be how I would have frame the question here be this guy who get a 34 year head start think about the kind of question we as a country be grapple with we as citizen be grapple with now what do we take away first I think be he relationship to in fact evil be something to learn from he over the course of he career change a great deal he have a lot of flaw but he be very adaptive I think that be he great quality he start as somebody who would denounce harmdoer he would charge up to person who be violate international law and he would say you be violate this be the U N Charter do not you see it be unacceptable what you be do and they would laugh at he because he do not have the power of state the power of any military or police he just have the rule he have the norm and he try to use they and in Lebanon Southern Lebanon in 82 he say to himself and to everybody else I will never use the word unacceptable again I will never use it I will try to make it such but I will never use that word again but he lunge in the opposite direction he start as I mention to get in the room with evil to not denounce and become almost obsequious when he win the nickname Serbio for instance and even when he negotiate with the Khmer Rouge would black box what have occur prior to enter the room but by the end of he life I think he have strike a balance that we as a country can learn from be in the room do not be afraid of talk to you adversary but do not bracket what happen before you enter the room do not black box history do not check you principle at the door and I think that be something that we have to be in the room whether it be Nixon go to China or Khrushchev and Kennedy or Reagan and Gorbachev all the great progress in this country with relation to we adversary have come by go into the room and it do not have to be a act of weakness you can actually do far more to build a international coalition against a harmdoer or a wrongdoer by be in the room and show to the rest of the world that that person that regime be the problem and that you the United States be not the problem second take away from Sergio life briefly what I take away and this in some way be the most important he espouse and exhibit a reverence for dignity that be really really unusual at a micro level the individual around he be visible he see they at a macro level he think you know we talk about democracy promotion but we do it in a way sometimes that be a affront to person dignity we put person on humanitarian aid and we boast about it because we have spend three billion it be incredibly important that person would no longer be alive if the United States for instance have not spend that money in Darfur but it be not a way to live if we think about dignity in we conduct as citizen and as individual with relation to the person around we and as a country if we could inject a regard for dignity into we dealings with other country it would be something of a revolution third point very briefly he talk a lot about freedom from fear and I recognize there be so much to be afraid of there be so many genuine threat in the world but what Sergio be talk about be let calibrate we relationship to the threat let be not hype the threat let actually see it clearly we have reason to be afraid of melt ice cap we have reason to be afraid that we have not secure loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union let focus on what be the legitimate challenge and threat but not lunge into bad decision because of a panic of a fear in time of fear for instance one of the thing Sergio use to say be fear be a bad advisor we lunge towards the extreme when we be not operate and try to again calibrate we relationship to the world around we fourth and final point he somehow because he be work in all the world bad place and all less evil have a humility of course and a awareness of the complexity of the world around he I mean such a acute awareness of how hard it be how sisyphean this task be of mend and yet aware of that complexity humble by it he be not paralyze by it and we as citizen as we go through this experience of the kind of the crisis of confidence crisis of competence crisis of legitimacy I think there be a temptation to pull back from the world and say ah Katrina Iraq we do not know what we be do we can not afford to pull back from the world it be a question of how to be in the world and the lesson I think of the anti genocide movement that I mention that be a partial success but by no means have it achieve what it have set out to do it will be many decade probably before that happen but be that if we want to see change we have to become the change we can not rely upon we institution to do the work of necessarily talk to adversary on they own without we create a space for that to happen for have respect for dignity and for bring that combination of humility and a sort of embolden sense of responsibility to we dealings with the rest of the world so will evil prevail be that the question I think the short answer be no not unless we let it thank you applause
