hello actually that be hello in Bauer Bodoni for the typographically hysterical amongst we one of the thread that seem to have come through loud and clear in the last couple of day be this need to reconcile what the Big want the Big be the organization the system the country and what the small want the individual the person and how do you bring that two thing together Charlie Ledbetter yesterday I think talk very articulately about this need to bring consumer to bring person into the process of create thing and that be what I want to talk about today so bring together the small to help facilitate and create the Big I think be something that we believe in something I believe in and something that we kind of bring to life through what we do at Ideo I call this first chapter for the Brits in the room the blind glimpse of the bleeding obvious often the good idea be so stare at you right in the face that you kind of miss they and I think a lot of time what we do be just sort of hold the mirror up to we client and sort of go duh you know look what be really go on and rather than talk about it in the theory I think I be just go to show you a example we be ask by a large healthcare system in Minnesota to describe to they what they patient experience be and I think they be expect they have work with lot of consultant before I think they be expect some kind of hideous org chart with thousand of bubble and systemic this that and the other and all kind of mappy stuff or even bad some kind of ghastly death by Powerpoint thing with WowCharts and all kind of you know God know whatever the first thing we actually share with they be this I will play this until you eyeball completely dissolve this be 59 second into the film this be a minute 59 3 19 I think something happen I think a head may appear in a second 5 10 5 58 6 20 we show they the whole cut and they be all completely what be this and the point be when you lie in a hospital bed all day all you do be look at the roof and it be a really shitty experience and just put yourself in the position of the patient this be Christian who work with we at Ideo he just lay in the hospital bed and kind of stare at the polystyrene ceiling tile for a really long time that be what it be like to be a patient in the hospital and they be sort you know blind glimpse of bleeding obvious oh my goodness so look at the situation from the point of view of the person out as oppose to the traditional position of the organization in be for this guy quite a revelation and so that be a really catalytic thing for they so they snap into action they say ok it be not about systemic change it be not about huge ridiculous thing that we need to do it be about tiny thing that can make a huge amount of difference so we start with they prototype some really little thing that we could do to have a huge amount of impact the first thing we do be we take a little bicycle mirror and we Band aid it here onto a gurney a hospital trolley so that when you be wheel around by a nurse or by a doctor you could actually have a conversation with they you could kind of see they in you rear view mirror so it create a tiny human interaction very small example of something that they could do interestingly the nurse themselves sort of snap into action say ok we embrace this what can we do the first thing they do be they decorate the ceiling which I think be really I show this to my mother recently I think my mother now think that I be some sort of interior decorator it be what I do for a live sort of Laurence Llewelyn Bowen not particularly the world good design solution for that of we who be real sort of hard core designer but nonetheless a fabulous empathic solution for person thing that they start do themselves like change the floor go into the patient room so that it signify this be my room this be my personal space be a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem so you go from public space to private space and another idea again that come from one of the nurse which I love be they take traditional sort of corporate white board then they put they on one wall of the patient room and they put this sticker there so that what you could actually do be go into the room and write message to the person who be sick in that room which be lovely so tiny tiny tiny solution that make a huge amount of impact I think that be a really really nice example so this be not particularly a new idea kind of see opportunity in thing that be around you and snap and turn they into a solution it be a history of invention base around this I be go to read this because I want to get this name right Joan Ganz Cooney see she daughter come down on a Saturday morning see she daughter watch the test card wait for program to come on one morning and from that come Sesame Street Malcolm McLean be move from one country to another and be wonder why it take this guy so long to get the box onto the ship and he invent the shipping container George de Mestral this be not bug all over a birkenstock be walk he dog in a field and get cover in burr sort of little prickly thing and from that come Velcro and finally for the Brits Percy Shaw this be a big British invention see the cat eye at the side of the road when he be drive home one night and from that come the Catseye so there be a whole series of just use you eye see thing for the first time see thing afresh and use they as a opportunity to create new possibility second one without sound overly Zen and this be a quote from the Buddha Finding yourself in the margin look to the edge of thing be often a really interesting place to start blinkered vision tend to produce I think blinkered solution so look wide use you peripheral vision be a really interesting place to look for opportunity again another medical example here we be ask by a device producer we do the Palm Pilot and the Treo we do a lot of sexy tech at Ideo they have see this and they want a sexy piece of technology for medical diagnostic this be a device that a nurse use when they be do a spinal procedure in hospital they will ask the nurse to input datum and they have this vision of the nurse kind of click away on this aluminum device and it all be incredibly sort of gadget lustish when we actually go and watch this procedure take place and I will explain this in a second it become very obvious that there be a human dimension to this that they really be not recognize when you be have a four inch needle insert into you spine which be the procedure that this device datum be about it be for pain management you be shit scare you be freak out and so the first thing that pretty much every nurse do be hold the patient hand to comfort they human gesture which make the fabulous two handed datum input completely impossible so the thing that we design much less sexy but much more human and practical be this so it be not a Palm Pilot by any stretch of the imagination but it have a thumb scroll so you can do everything with one hand so again go back to this the idea that a tiny human gesture dictate the design of this product and I think that be really really important so again this idea of workaround we use this phrase workaround a lot sort of look around we I be actually look around the TED and just watch all of this kind of thing happen while I have be here this idea of the way that person cobble together solution in we life and the thing we kind of do in we environment that be somewhat subconscious but have huge potential be something that we look at a lot we write a book recently I think you might have receive it call thoughtless Acts it be be all about this kind of thoughtless thing that person do which have huge intention and huge opportunity why do we all follow the line in the street this be a picture in a Japanese subway person consciously follow thing even though why we do not know why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence because we kind of have to we be just compel to we do not know why but we do why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle again we be sort of use the world around we to create we own design solution and we be always say to we client you should look at this stuff this stuff be really important this stuff be really vital this be person design they own experience you can draw from this we sort of assume that because there be a pole in the street that it be okay to use it so we park we shopping cart there it be there for we use on some level so again we sort of co opt we environment to do all this different thing we co opt other experience we take one item and transfer it to another and this be my favorite one my mother use to say to I just because you sister jump in the lake do not mean you have to but of course we all do we all follow each other every day so somebody assume that because somebody else have do something that be permission for they to do the same thing and there be almost this sort of semaphore around we all the time I mean shopping bag equal parking meter out of order and we all kind of know how to read this signal now we all talk to one another in this highly visual way without realize what we be do third section be this idea of not know of consciously put yourself backwards I talk about unthinking situation all the time sort of have beginner mind scrape you mind clean and look at thing afresh a friend of mine be a designer at IKEA and he be ask by he boss to help design a storage system for child this be the Billy bookcase it be IKEA big sell product hammer it together hammer it together with a shoe if you be I because they be impossible to assemble but big selling bookcase how do we replicate this for child the reality be when you actually watch child child do not think about thing like storage in linear term child assume permission in a very different way child live on thing they live under thing they live around thing and so they spatial awareness relationship and they think around storage be totally different so the first thing you have to do this be Graham the designer be sort of put yourself in they shoe and so here he be sit under the table so what come out of this this be the storage system that he design so what be this I hear you all ask no I do not laughter it be this and I think this be a particularly lovely solution so you know it be a totally different way of look at the situation it be a completely empathic solution apart from the fact that teddy probably not love it laughter but a really nice way of re frame the ordinary and I think that be one of the thing and put yourself in the position of the person and I think that be one of the thread that I have hear again from this conference be how do we put ourselves in other people shoe and really feel what they feel and then use that information to fuel solution and I think that be what this be very much about last section green armband we have all get they it be about this really I mean it be about pick battle big enough to matter but small enough to win again that be one of the theme that I think have come through loud and clear in this conference be where do we start how do we start what do we do to start so again we be ask to design a water pump for a company call ApproTEC in Kenya they be now call KickStart and again as designer we want to make this thing incredibly beautiful and spend a lot of time thinking of the form and that be completely irrelevant when you put yourself in the position of this person thing like the fact that this have to be able to fold up and fit on a bicycle become much more relevant than the form of it the way it be produce it have to be produce with indigenous manufacturing method and indigenous material so it have to be look at completely from the point of view of the user we have to completely transfer ourselves over to they world so what seem like a very clunky product be in fact incredibly useful it be power a bit like a Stairmaster you pump up and down on it Children can use it adult can use it everybody use it it be turn this guy again one of the theme it be turn they into entrepreneur this guy be use this very successfully and for we it be be great because it be win load of design award so we actually manage to reconcile the need of the design company the need of the individual in the company to feel good about a product we be actually design and the need of the individual we be design it for there it be pump water from 30 foot so as a final gesture we hand out this bracelet to all of you this morning we have make a donation on everybody behalf here to kick start no pun intend they next project because again I think sort of put we money where we mouth be here we feel that this be a important gesture so we have hand out bracelet small be the new big I hope you will all wear they so that be it thank you applause
