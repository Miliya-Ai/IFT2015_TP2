so can we dare to be optimistic well the thesis of the bottom billion be that a billion person have be stick live in economy that have be stagnant for 40 year and hence diverge from the rest of mankind and so the real question to pose be not can we be optimistic it be how can we give credible hope to that billion person that to my mind be the fundamental challenge now of development what I be go to offer you be a recipe a combination of the two force that change the world for good which be the alliance of compassion and enlightened self interest Compassion because a billion person be live in society that have not offer credible hope that be a human tragedy enlighten self interest because if that economic divergence continue for another 40 year combine with social integration globally it will build a nightmare for we child we need compassion to get ourselves start and enlighten self interest to get ourselves serious that be the alliance that change the world so what do it mean to get serious about provide hope for the bottom billion what can we actually do well a good guide be to think what do we do last time the rich world get serious about develop another region of the world that give we it turn out quite a good clue except you have to go back quite a long time the last time the rich world get serious about develop another region be in the late 1940 the rich world be you America and the region that need to be develop be my world Europe that be post War Europe why do America get serious it be not just compassion for Europe though there be that it be that you know you have to because in the late 1940 country after country in Central Europe be fall into the soviet bloc and so you know you have no choice Europe have to be drag into economic development so what do you do last time you get serious well yes you have a big aid program thank you very much that be Marshall aid we need to do it again Aid be part of the solution but what else do you do well you tear up you trade policy and totally reverse it before the war America have be highly protectionist after the war you open you market to Europe you drag Europe into the then global economy which be you economy and you institutionalize that trade liberalization through find the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade so total reversal of trade policy do you do anything else yes you totally reverse you security policy before the war you security policy have be isolationist after the war you tear that up you put 100 000 troops in Europe for over 40 year so total reversal of security policy anything else yes you tear up the Eleventh commandment national sovereignty before the war you treat national sovereignty as so sacrosanct that you be not even willing to join the League of Nations after the war you find the United Nations you find the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development you find the IMF you encourage Europe to create the European Community all system for mutual government support that be still the waterfront of effective policy aid trade security government of course the detail of policy be go to be different because the challenge be different it be not rebuild Europe it be reverse the divergence for the bottom billion so that they actually catch up be that easy or hard we need to be at least as serious as we be then now today I be go to take just one of that four I be go to take the one that sound the weak the one that be just motherhood and apple pie government mutual system of support for government and I be go to show you one idea in how we could do something to strengthen governance and I be go to show you that that be enormously important now the opportunity we be go to look to be a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion and that be the commodity boom the commodity boom be pump unprecedented amount of money into many though not all of the country of the bottom billion partly they be pump money in because commodity price be high but it be not just that there be also a range of new discovery Uganda have just discover oil in about the most disastrous location on Earth Ghana have discover oil guinea have get a huge new exploitation of iron ore come out of the ground so a mass of new discovery between they this new revenue flow dwarf aid just to give you one example Angola alone be get 50 billion dollar a year in oil revenue the entire aid flow to the 60 country of the bottom billion last year be 34 billion so the flow of resource from the commodity boom to the bottom billion be without precedent so there be the optimism the question be how be it go to help they development it be a huge opportunity for transformational development will it be take so here come a bit of science and this be a bit of science I have do since the bottom billion so it be new I have look to see what be the relationship between high commodity price of export and the growth of commodity export country and I have look globally I have take all the country in the world for the last 40 year and look to see what the relationship be and the short run say the first five to seven year be just great in fact it be hunky dory everything go up you get more money because you term of trade have improve but also that drive up output across the board so GDP go up a lot fantastic that be the short run and how about the long run come back 15 year late well the short run it be hunky dory but the long run it be humpty dumpty you go up in the short run but then most society historically have end up bad than if they have have no boom at all that be not a forecast about how commodity price go it be a forecast of the consequence the long term consequence for growth of a increase in price so what go wrong why be there this resource curse as it be call and again I have look at that and it turn out that the critical issue be the level of governance the initial level of economic governance when the resource boom accrue in fact if you have get good enough governance there be no resource boom you go up in the short term and then you go up even more in the long term that be Norway the rich country in Europe it be Australia it be Canada the resource curse be entirely confine to country below a threshold of governance they still go up in the short run that be what we be see across the bottom billion at the moment the good growth rate they have have ever and the question be whether the short run will persist and with bad governance historically over the last 40 year it have not it be country like Nigeria which be bad off than if they have never have oil so there be a threshold level above which you go up in the long term and below which you go down just to benchmark that threshold it be about the governance level of Portugal in the mid 1980 so the question be be the bottom billion above or below that threshold now there be one big change since the commodity boom of the 1970 and that be the spread of democracy so I think well maybe that be the thing which have transform governance in the bottom billion maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy so I look democracy do have significant effect and unfortunately they be adverse democracy make even more of a mess of this resource boom than autocracy at that stage I just want to abandon the research but laughter it turn out that democracy be a little bit more complicated than that because there be two distinct aspect of democracy there be electoral competition which determine how you acquire power and there be check and balance which determine how you use power it turn out that electoral competition be the thing that be do the damage with democracy whereas strong check and balance make resource boom good and so what the country of the bottom billion need be very strong check and balance they have not get they they get instant democracy in the 1990 election without check and balance how can we help improve governance and introduce check and balance in all the society of the bottom billion there be intense struggle to do just that the simple proposal be that we should have some international standard which will be voluntary but which would spell out the key decision point that need to be take in order to harness this resource revenue we know this international standard work because we have already get one it be call the Extractive Industries transparency Initiative that be the very simple idea that government should report to they citizen what revenue they have no soon be it propose than reformer in Nigeria adopt it push it and publish the revenue in the paper Nigerian newspaper circulation spike person want to know what they government be get in term of revenue so we know it work what would the content be of this international standard I can not go through all of they but I will give you a example the first be how to take the resource out of the ground the economic process take the resource out of the ground and put asset on top of the ground and the first step in that be sell the right to resource extraction you know how right to resource extraction be be sell at the moment how they have be sell over the last 40 year a company fly in do a deal with a minister and that be great for the company and it be quite often great for the minister laughter and it be not great for they country there be a very simple institutional technology which can transform that and it be call verify auction the public agency with the great expertise on Earth be of course the treasury that be the British Treasury and the British Treasury decide that it would sell the right to third generation mobile phone by work out what that right be worth they work out they be worth two billion pound just in time a set of economist get there and say why not try a auction it will reveal the value it go for 20 billion pound through auction if the British Treasury can be out by a factor of 10 think what the ministry of finance in Sierra Leone be go to be like laughter when I put that to the President of Sierra Leone the next day he ask the World Bank to send he a team to give expertise on how to conduct auction there be five such decision point each one need a international standard if we could do it we would change the world we would be help the reformer in this society who be struggle for change that be we modest role we can not change this society but we can help the person in this society who be struggle and usually fail because the odds be so stack against they and yet we have not get this rule if you think about it the cost of promulgate international rule be zilch nothing why on Earth be they not there I realize that the reason they be not there be that until we have a critical mass of informed citizen in we own society politician will get away with gesture that unless we have a informed society what politician do especially in relation to Africa be gesture thing that look good but do not work and so I realize we have to go through the business of build a informed citizenry that be why I break all the professional rule of conduct for a economist and I write a economics book that you could read on a beach laughter however I have to say the process of communication do not come naturally to I this be why I be on this stage but it be alarming I grow up in a culture of self effacement my wife show I a blog comment on one of my last talk and the blog comment say Collier be not charismatic laughter but he argument be compelling laughter applause if you agree with that sentiment and if you agree that we need a critical mass of informed citizenry you will realize that I need you please become ambassador thank you applause
