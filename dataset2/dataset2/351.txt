I be try to think how be sync connect to happiness and it occur to I that for some reason we take pleasure in synchronize we like to dance together we like sing together and so if you will put up with this I would like to enlist you help with a first experiment today the experiment be and I notice by the way that when you applaud that you do it in a typical north American way that be you be raucous and incoherent you be not organize it do not even occur to you to clap in unison do you think you could do it I would like to see if this audience would no you have not practice as far as I know can you get it together to clap in sync clapping whoa now that be what we call emergent behavior laughter so I do not expect that but I mean I expect you could synchronize it do not occur to I you would increase you frequency it be interesting laughter so what do we make of that First of all we know that you be all brilliant this be a room full of intelligent person highly sensitive some train musician out there be that what enable you to synchronize so to put the question a little more seriously let ask ourselves what be the minimum requirement for what you just do for spontaneous synchronization do you need for instance to be as smart as you be do you even need a brain at all just to synchronize do you need to be alive I mean that be a spooky thought right inanimate object that might spontaneously synchronize themselves it be real in fact I will try to explain today that sync be maybe one of if not one of the most perhaps the most pervasive drive in all of nature it extend from the subatomic scale to the farth reach of the cosmos it be a deep tendency toward order in nature that oppose what we have all be teach about entropy I mean I be not say the law of entropy be wrong it be not but there be a countervail force in the universe the tendency towards spontaneous order and so that be we theme now to get into that let I begin with what might have occur to you immediately when you hear that we be talk about synchrony in nature which be the glorious example of bird that flock together or fish swimming in organized school so this be not particularly intelligent creature and yet as we will see they exhibit beautiful ballet this be from a BBC show call Predators and what we be look at here be example of synchrony that have to do with defense when you be small and vulnerable like this starling or like the fish it help to swarm to avoid predator to confuse predator let I be quiet for a second because this be so gorgeous for a long time biologist be puzzle by this behavior wonder how it could be possible we be so use to choreography give rise to synchrony this creature be not choreograph they be choreograph themselves and only today be science start to figure out how it work I will show you a computer model make by Iain Couzin a researcher at Oxford that show how swarm work there be just three simple rule first all the individual be only aware of they near neighbor second all the individual have a tendency to line up and third they be all attract to each other but they try to keep a small distance apart and when you build that three rule in automatically you start to see swarm that look very much like fish school or bird flock now fish like to stay close together about a body length apart bird try to stay about three or four body length apart but except for that difference the rule be the same for both now all this change when a predator enter the scene there be a fourth rule when a predator come get out of the way here on the model you see the predator attack the prey move out in random direction and then the rule of attraction bring they back together again so there be this constant splitting and reform and you see that in nature keep in mind that although it look as if each individual be act to cooperate what be really go on be a kind of selfish darwinian behavior each be scatter away at random to try to save its scale or feather that be out of the desire to save itself each creature be follow this rule and that lead to something that be safe for all of they even though it look like they be think as a group they be not you might wonder what exactly be the advantage to be in a swarm so you can think of several as I say if you be in a swarm you odds of be the unlucky one be reduce as compare to a small group there be many eye to spot danger and you will see in the example with the starling with the bird when this peregrine hawk be about to attack they that actually wave of panic can propagate send message over great distance you will see let see it be come up possibly at the very end maybe not information can be send over half a kilometer away in a very short time through this mechanism yes it be happen here see if you can see that wave propagate through the swarm it be beautiful the bird be we sort of understand we think from that computer model what be go on as I say it be just that three simple rule plus the one about watch out for predator there do not seem to be anything mystical about this we do not however really understand at a mathematical level I be a mathematician we would like to be able to understand good I mean I show you a computer model but a computer be not understand a computer be in a way just another experiment we would really like to have a deep insight into how this work and to understand you know exactly where this organization come from how do the rule give rise to the pattern there be one case that we have begin to understand good and it be the case of firefly if you see firefly in North America like so many north American sort of thing they tend to be independent operator they ignore each other they each do they own thing flash on and off pay no attention to they neighbor but in Southeast Asia place like Thailand or Malaysia or Borneo there be a beautiful cooperative behavior that occur among male firefly you can see it every night along the river bank the tree mangrove tree be fill with firefly communicate with light specifically it be male firefly who be all flash in perfect time together in perfect synchrony to reinforce a message to the female and the message as you can imagine be come hither mate with I Music in a second I be go to show you a slow motion of a single firefly so that you can get a sense this be a single frame then on and then off a 30th of a second there and then watch this whole river bank and watch how precise the synchrony be on more on and then off the combine light from this beetle this be actually tiny beetle be so bright that fisherman out at sea can use they as navigate beacon to find they way back to they home river it be stunning for a long time it be not believe when the first western traveler like Sir Francis Drake go to Thailand and come back with tale of this unbelievable spectacle no one believe they we do not see anything like this in Europe or in the West and for a long time even after it be document it be think to be some kind of optical illusion scientific paper be publish say it be twitching eyelid that explain it or you know a human being tendency to see pattern where there be none but I hope you have convince yourself now with this nighttime video that they really be very well synchronize okay well the issue then be do we need to be alive to see this kind of spontaneous order and I have already hint that the answer be no well you do not have to be a whole creature you can even be just a single cell like take for instance you pacemaker cell in you heart right now they be keep you alive every beat of you heart depend on this crucial region the sinoatrial node which have about 10 000 independent cell that would each beep have a electrical rhythm a voltage up and down to send a signal to the ventricle to pump now you pacemaker be not a single cell it be this democracy of 10 000 cell that all have to fire in unison for the pacemaker to work correctly I do not want to give you the idea that synchrony be always a good idea if you have epilepsy there be a instance of billion of brain cell or at least million discharge in pathological concert so this tendency towards order be not always a good thing you do not have to be alive you do not have to be even a single cell if you look for instance at how laser work that would be a case of atomic synchrony in a laser what make laser light so different from the light above my head here be that this light be incoherent many different color and different frequency sort of like the way you clap initially but if you be a laser it would be rhythmic applause it would be all atom pulsate in unison emit light of one color one frequency now come the very risky part of my talk which be to demonstrate that inanimate thing can synchronize hold you breath for I what I have here be two empty water bottle this be not Keith Barry do a magic trick this be a klutz just play with some water bottle I have some metronome here can you hear that all right so I have get a metronome and it be the world small metronome the well I should not advertise anyway so this be the world small metronome I have set it on the fast setting and I be go to now take another one set to the same setting we can try this first if I just put they on the table together there be no reason for they to synchronize and they probably will not maybe you would better listen to they I will stand here what I be hope be that they might just drift apart because they frequency be not perfectly the same right they do they be in sync for a while but then they drift apart and the reason be that they be not able to communicate now you might think that be a bizarre idea how can metronome communicate well they can communicate through mechanical force so I be go to give they a chance to do that I also want to wind this one up a bit how can they communicate I be go to put they on a movable platform which be the guide to Graduate Study at Cornell okay so here it be let see if we can get this to work my wife point out to I that it will work good if I put both on at the same time because otherwise the whole thing will tip over all right so there we go let see ok I be not try to cheat let I start they out of sync no hard to even do that applause all right so before any one go out of sync I will just put that right there laughter now that might seem a bit whimsical but this pervasiveness of this tendency towards spontaneous order sometimes have unexpected consequence and a clear case of that be something that happen in London in the year 2000 the Millennium Bridge be suppose to be the pride of London a beautiful new footbridge erect across the Thames first river crossing in over 100 year in London there be a big competition for the design of this bridge and the win proposal be submit by a unusual team in the TED spirit actually of a architect perhaps the great architect in the United Kingdom Lord Norman Foster work with a artist a sculptor Sir Anthony Caro and a engineering firm Ove Arup and together they submit a design base on Lord Foster vision which be he remember as a kid read Flash Gordon comic book and he say that when Flash Gordon would come to a abyss he would shoot what today would be a kind of a light saber he would shoot he light saber across the abyss make a blade of light and then scamper across on this blade of light he say that be the vision I want to give to London I want a blade of light across the Thames so they build the blade of light and it be a very thin ribbon of steel the world probably the flat and thin suspension bridge there be with cable that be out on the side you be use to suspension bridge with big droopy cable on the top this cable be on the side of the bridge like if you take a rubber band and stretch it taut across the Thames that be what be hold up this bridge now everyone be very excited to try it out on open day thousand of Londoners come out and something happen and within two day the bridge be close to the public so I want to first show you some interview with person who be on the bridge on open day who will describe what happen Man it really start move sideways and slightly up and down rather like be on the boat woman yeah it feel unstable and it be very windy and I remember it have lot of flag up and down the side so you could definitely there be something go on sideways it feel maybe interviewer not up and down boy no interviewer and not forward and backwards boy no interviewer just sideways about how much be it move do you think Boy it be about interviewer I mean that much or this much boy about the second one interviewer this much boy yeah man it be at least six six to eight inch I would have think interviewer right so at least this much man oh yes woman I remember want to get off interviewer oh do you Woman yeah it feel odd interviewer so it be enough to be scary woman yeah but I think that be just I interviewer ah now tell I why you have to do this boy we have to do this because to keep in balance because if you do not keep you balance then you would just fall over about like to the left or right about 45 degree interviewer so just show I how you walk normally right and then show I what it be like when the bridge start to go right so you have to deliberately push you foot out sideways and oh and short step man that be right and it seem obvious to I that it be probably the number of person on it interviewer be they deliberately walk in step or anything like that Man No they just have to conform to the movement of the bridge Steven Strogatz all right so that already give you a hint of what happen think of the bridge as be like this platform think of the person as be like metronome now you might not be use to thinking of yourself as a metronome but after all we do walk like I mean we oscillate back and forth as we walk and especially if we start to walk like that person do right they all show this strange sort of skate gait that they adopt once the bridge start to move and so let I show you now the footage of the bridge but also after you see the bridge on open day you will see a interesting clip of work do by a bridge engineer at Cambridge name Allan McRobie who figure out what happen on the bridge and who build a bridge simulator to explain exactly what the problem be it be a kind of unintended positive feedback loop between the way the person walk and the way the bridge begin to move that engineer know nothing about actually I think the first person you will see be the young engineer who be put in charge of this project okay video interviewer do anyone get hurt engineer no interviewer right so it be quite small engineer yes interviewer but real engineer absolutely interviewer you think oh bother engineer I feel I be disappointed about it we have spend a lot of time design this bridge and we have analyze it we have check it to code to heavy load than the code and here it be do something that we do not know about interviewer you do not expect engineer exactly Narrator the most dramatic and shocking footage show whole section of the crowd hundred of person apparently rock from side to side in unison not only with each other but with the bridge this synchronize movement seem to be drive the bridge but how could the crowd become synchronize be there something special about the Millennium Bridge that cause this effect this be to be the focus of the investigation interviewer well at last the simulated bridge be finish and I can make it wobble now Allan this be all you fault be not it Allan McRobie yes interviewer you design this yes this simulate bridge and this you reckon mimic the action of the real bridge am it capture a lot of the physics yes interviewer right so if we get on it we should be able to wobble it yes Allan McRobie be a bridge engineer from Cambridge who write to I suggest that a bridge simulator ought to wobble in the same way as the real bridge provide we hang it on pendulum of exactly the right length am this one only a couple of ton so it be fairly easy to get go just by walk interviewer well it be certainly go now AM it do not have to be a real dangle just walk it start to go interviewer it be actually quite difficult to walk you have to be careful where you put you foot down do not you because if you get it wrong it just throw you off you foot am it certainly affect the way you walk yes you can not walk normally on it interviewer no if you try and put one foot in front of another it be move you foot away from under you be yes interviewer so you have get to put you foot out sideways so already the simulator be make I walk in exactly the same way as we witness walk on the real bridge am ice skating gait there be not all this sort of snake way of walk interviewer for a more convincing experiment I want my own opening day crowd the sound check team they instruction just walk normally it be really intriguing because none of this person be try to drive it they be all have some difficulty walk and the only way you can walk comfortably be by get in step but then of course everyone be drive the bridge you can not help it you be actually force by the movement of the bridge to get into step and therefore to drive it to move further SS all right well with that from the Ministry of silly walk maybe I have good end I see I have go over but I hope that you will go outside and see the world in a new way to see all the amazing synchrony around we thank you applause
