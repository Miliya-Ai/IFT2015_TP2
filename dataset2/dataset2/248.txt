I be go to talk about a technology that we be develop at Oxford now that we think be go to change the way that computer game and Hollywood movie be be make that technology be simulate human it be simulated human with a simulated body and a simulated nervous system to control that body now before I talk more about that technology let have a quick look at what human character look like at the moment in computer game this be a clip from a game call Grand theft auto 3 we already see that briefly yesterday and what you can see be it be actually a very good game it be one of the most successful game of all time but what you will see be that all the animation in this game be very repetitive they pretty much look the same I have make he run into a wall here over and over again and you can see he look always the same the reason for that be that this character be actually not real character they be a graphical visualization of a character to produce this animation a animator at a studio have to anticipate what be go to happen in the actual game and then have to animate that particular sequence so he or she sit down animate it and try to anticipate what be go to happen and then this particular animation be just play back at appropriate time in the computer game now the result of that be that you can not have real interactivity all you have be animation that be play back at more or less the appropriate time it also mean that game be not really go to be as surprising as they could be because you only get out of it at least in term of the character what you actually put into it there be no real emergence there and thirdly as I say most of the animation be very repetitive because of that now the only way to get around that be to actually simulate the human body and to simulate that bit of the nervous system of the brain that control that body and maybe if I could have you for a quick demonstration to show what the difference be because I mean it be very very trivial if I push Chris a bit like this for example he will react to it if I push he from a different angle he will react to it differently and that be because he have a physical body and because he have the motor skill to control that body it be a very trivial thing it be not something you get in computer game at the moment at all thank you very much Chris Anderson that be it Torsten Reil that be it yes so that be what we be try to simulate not Chris specifically I should say but human in general now we start work on this a while ago at Oxford University and we try to start very simply what we try to do be teach a stick figure how to walk that stick figure be physically stimulate you can see it here on the screen so it be subject to gravity have joint etc if you just run the simulation it will just collapse like this the tricky bit be now to put a ai controller in it that actually make it work and for that we use the neural network which we base on that part of the nervous system that we have in we spine that control walk in human it be call the central pattern generator so we simulate that as well and then the really tricky bit be to teach that network how to walk for that we use artificial evolution genetic algorithm we hear about that already yesterday and I suppose that most of you be familiar with that already but just briefly the concept be that you create a large number of different individual neural network in this case all of which be random at the begin you hook this up in this case to the virtual muscle of that two legged creature here and hope that it do something interesting at the beginning they be all go to be very boring most of they will not move at all but some of they might make a tiny step that be then select by the algorithm reproduce with mutation and recombination to introduce sex as well and you repeat that process over and over again until you have something that walk in this case in a straight line like this so that be the idea behind this when we start this I set up the simulation one evening it take about three to four hour to run the simulation I get up the next morning go to the computer and look at the result and be hope for something that walk in a straight line like I have just demonstrate and this be what I get instead laughter so it be back to the drawing board for we we do get it to work eventually after tweaking a bit here and there and this be a example of a successful evolutionary run so what you will see in a moment be a very simple biped that be learn how to walk use artificial evolution at the begin it can not walk at all but it will get good and good over time so this be the one that can not walk at all laughter now after five generation of apply evolutionary process the genetic algorithm be get a tiny bit well laughter generation 10 and it will take a few step more still not quite there but now after generation 20 it actually walk in a straight line without fall over that be the real breakthrough for we it be academically quite a challenging project and once we have reach that stage we be quite confident that we could try and do other thing as well with this approach actually simulate the body and simulate that part of the nervous system that control it now at this stage it also become clear that this could be very exciting for thing like computer game or online world what you see here be the character stand there and there be a obstacle that we put in its way and what you see be it be go to fall over the obstacle now the interesting bit be if I move the obstacle a tiny bit to the right which be what I be do now here it will fall over it in a completely different way and again if you move the obstacle a tiny bit it will again fall differently laughter now what you see by the way at the top there be some of the neural activation be feed into the virtual muscle okay that be the video thanks now this might look kind of trivial but it be actually very important because this be not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual world now at this stage we decide to start a company and move this further because obviously this be just a very simple blocky biped what we really want be a full human body so we start the company we hire a team of physicist software engineer and biologist to work on this and the first thing we have to work on be to create the human body basically it be get to be relatively fast so you can run it on a normal machine but it be get to be accurate enough so it look good enough basically so we put quite a bit of biomechanical knowledge into this thing and try to make it as realistic as possible what you see here on the screen right now be a very simple visualization of that body I should add that it be very simple to add thing like hair clothes etc but what we have do here be use a very simple visualization so you can concentrate on the movement now what I be go to do right now in a moment be just push this character a tiny bit and we will see what happen nothing really interesting basically it fall over but it fall over like a rag doll basically the reason for that be that there be no intelligence in it it become interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it so this character now have motor skill in the upper body nothing in the leg yet in this particular one but what it will do I be go to push it again it will realize autonomously that it be be push it be go to stick out its hand it be go to turn around into the fall and try and catch the fall so that be what you see here now it get really interesting if you then add the ai for the low part of the body as well so here we have get the same character I be go to push it a bit hard now hard than I just push Chris but what you will see be it be go to receive a push now from the leave what you see be it take step backwards it try to counter balance it try to look at the place where it think it be go to land I will show you this again and then finally hit the floor now this become really exciting when you push that character in different direction again just as I have do that be something that you can not do right now at the moment you only have empty computer graphic in game what this be now be a real simulation that be what I want to show you now so here be the same character with the same behavior I have just show you but now I be just go to push it from different direction first start with a push from the right this be all slow motion by the way so we can see what be go on now the angle will have change a tiny bit so you can see that the reaction be different again a push now this time from the front and you see it fall differently and now from the left and it fall differently that be really exciting for we to see that that be the first time we have see that this be the first time the public see this as well because we have be in stealth mode I have not show this to anybody yet now just a fun thing what happen if you put that character this be now a wooden version of it but it be get the same ai in it but if you put that character on a slippery surface like ice we just do that for a laugh just to see what happen laughter and this be what happen laughter applause it be nothing we have to do about this we just take this character that I just talk about put it on a slippery surface and this be what you get out of it and that be a really fascinating thing about this approach now when we go to film studio and game developer and show they that technology we get a very good response and what they say be the first thing they need immediately be virtual stuntman because stunt be obviously very dangerous they be very expensive and there be a lot of stunt scene that you can not do obviously because you can not really allow the stuntman to be seriously hurt so they want to have a digital version of a stuntman and that be what we have be work on for the past few month and that be we first product that we be go to release in a couple of week so here be just a few very simple scene of the guy just be kick that be what person want that be what we be give they laughter you can see it be always react this be not a dead body this be a body who basically in this particular case feel the force and try to protect its head only I think it be quite a big blow again you feel kind of sorry for that thing and we have see it so many time now that we do not really care any more laughter there be much bad video than this by the way which I have take out but now here be another one what person want as a behavior be to have a explosion a strong force apply to the character and have the character react to it in midair so that you do not have a character that look limp but actually a character that you can use in a action film straight away that look kind of alive in midair as well so this character be go to be hit by a force it be go to realize it be in the air and it be go to try and well stick out its arm in the direction where it be land that be one angle here be another angle we now think that the realism we be achieve with this be good enough to be use in film and let just have a look at a slightly different visualization this be something I just get last night from a animation studio in London who be use we software and experiment with it right now so this be exactly the same behavior that you see but in a slightly good render version so if you look at the character carefully you see there be lot of body movement go on none of which you have to animate like in the old day animator have to actually animate they this be all happen automatically in the simulation this be a slightly different angle and again a slow motion version of this this be incredibly quick this be happen in real time you can run this simulation in real time in front of you eye change it if you want to and you get the animation straight out of it at the moment do something like this by hand would take you probably a couple of day this be another behavior they request I be not quite sure why but we have do it anyway it be a very simple behavior that show you the power of this approach in this case the character hand be fix to a particular point in space and all we have tell the character to do be to struggle and it look organic it look realistic you feel kind of sorry for the guy it be even bad and that be another video I just get last night if you render that a bit more realistically now I be show this to you just to show you how organic it actually can feel how realistic it can look and this be all a physical simulation of the body use ai to drive virtual muscle in that body now one thing which we do for a laugh be to create a slightly more complex stunt scene and one of the most famous stunt be the one where James Bond jump off a dam in Switzerland and then be catch by a bungee get a very short clip here yes you can just about see it here in this case they be use a real stunt man it be a very dangerous stunt it be just vote I think in the Sunday Times as one of the most impressive stunt now we have just try and look at we character and ask ourselves can we do that ourselves as well can we use the physical simulation of the character use artificial intelligence put that artificial intelligence into the character drive virtual muscle simulate the way he jump off the dam and then skydive afterwards and have he catch by a bungee afterwards we do that it take about altogether just two hour pretty much to create the simulation and that be what it look like here now this could do with a bit more work it be still very early stage and we pretty much just do this for a laugh just to see what we have get out of it but what we find over the past few month be that this approach that we be pretty much standard upon be incredibly powerful we be ourselves surprise what you actually get out of the simulation there be very often very surprising behavior that you do not predict before there be so many thing we can do with this right now the first thing as I say be go to be virtual stuntman several studio be use this software now to produce virtual stuntman and they be go to hit the screen quite soon actually for some major production the second thing be video game with this technology video game will look different and they will feel very different for the first time you will have actor that really feel very interactive that have real body that really react I think that be go to be incredibly exciting probably start with sport game which be go to become much more interactive but I particularly be really excited about use this technology in online world like there for example that Tom Melcher have show we the degree of interactivity you be go to get be totally different I think from what you be get right now a third thing we be look at and very interested in be simulation we have be approach by several simulation company but one project we be particularly excited about which we be start next month be to use we technology and in particular the walk technology to help aid surgeon who work on child with cerebral palsy to predict the outcome of operation on this child as you probably know it be very difficult to predict what the outcome of a operation be if you try and correct the gait the classic quote be I think it be unpredictable at well be what person think right now be the outcome now what we want to do with we software be allow we surgeon to have a tool we be go to simulate the gait of a particular child and the surgeon can then work on that simulation and try out different way to improve that gait before he actually commit to a actual surgery that be one project we be particularly excited about and that be go to start next month just finally this be only just the beginning we can only do several behavior right now the ai be not good enough to simulate a full human body the body yes but not all the motor skill that we have and I think we be only there if we can have something like ballet dancing right now we do not have that but I be very sure that we will be able to do that at some stage we do have one unintentional dancer actually the last thing I be go to show you this be a ai contour that be produce and evolve half evolve I should say to produce balance basically so you kick the guy and the guy suppose to counter balance that be what we think be go to come out of this but this be what emerge out of it in the end music bizarrely this thing do not have a head I be not quite sure why so this be not something we actually put in there he just start to create that dance himself he be actually a good dancer than I be I have to say and what you see after a while I think he even go into a climax right at the end and I think there you go laughter so that all happen automatically we do not put that in there that be just the simulation create this itself basically so it be just applause thanks not quite John Travolta yet but we be work on that as well so thanks very much for you time thanks applause ca incredible that be really incredible tr thanks
