I be go to talk about compassion and the golden rule from a secular perspective and even from a kind of scientific perspective I be go to try to give you a little bit of a natural history of compassion and the golden rule so I be go to be sometimes use kind of clinical language and so it be not go to sound as warm and fuzzy as you average compassion talk I want to warn you about that so I do want to say at the outset that I think compassion great the golden rule be great I be a big supporter of both and I think it be great that the leader of the religion of the world be affirm compassion and the golden rule as fundamental principle that be integral to they faith at the same time I think religion do not deserve all the credit I think nature give they a help hand here I be go to argue tonight that compassion and the golden rule be in a certain sense build into human nature but I be also go to argue that once you understand the sense in which they be build into human nature you realize that just affirm compassion and affirm the golden rule be really not enough there be a lot of work to be do after that ok so a quick natural history first of compassion in the begin there be compassion and I mean not just when human being first show up but actually even before that I think it be probably the case that in the human evolutionary lineage even before there be homo sapiens feeling like compassion and love and sympathy have earn they way into the gene pool and biologist have a pretty clear idea of how this first happen it happen through a principle know as kin selection and the basic idea of kin selection be that if a animal feel compassion for a close relative and this compassion lead the animal to help the relative then in the end the compassion actually wind up help the gene underlie the compassion itself so from a biologist point of view compassion be actually a gene way of help itself ok I warn you this be not go to be very warm and fuzzy I will get there I hope to get a little fuzzy this do not bother I so much that the underlie darwinian rationale of compassion be kind of self serve at the genetic level actually I think the bad news about kin selection be just that it mean that this kind of compassion be naturally deploy only within the family that be the bad news the good news be compassion be natural the bad news be that this kin select compassion be naturally confine to the family now there be more good news that come along later in evolution a second kind of evolutionary logic biologist call that reciprocal altruism ok and there the basic idea be that compassion lead you to do good thing for person who then will return the favor again I know this be not as inspire a notion of compassion as you may have hear in the past but from a biologist point of view this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion be ultimately self serve too it be not that person think that when they feel the compassion it be not consciously self serve but to a biologist that be the logic and so you wind up most easily extend compassion to friend and ally I be sure a lot of you if a close friend have something really terrible happen to they you feel really bad but if you read in the newspaper that something really horrible happen to somebody you have never hear of you can probably live with that that be just human nature so it be another good news bad news story it be good that compassion be extend beyond the family by this kind of evolutionary logic the bad news be this do not bring we universal compassion by itself so there be still work to be do now there be one other result of this dynamic call reciprocal altruism which I think be kind of good news which be that the way that this be play out in the human species it have give person a intuitive appreciation of the golden rule I do not quite mean that the golden rule itself be write in we gene but you can go to a hunter gatherer society that have have no exposure to any of the great religious tradition no exposure to ethical philosophy and you will find if you spend time with this person that basically they believe that one good turn deserve another and that bad deed should be punish and evolutionary psychologist think that this intuition have a basis in the gene so they do understand that if you want to be treat well you treat other person well and it be good to treat other person well that be close to be a kind of build in intuition so that be good news now if you have be pay attention you be probably anticipate that there be bad news here we still be not to universal love and it be true because although a appreciation of the golden rule be natural it be also natural to carve out exception to the golden rule I mean for example none of we probably want to go to prison but we all think that there be some person who should go to prison right so we think we should treat they differently than we would want to be treat now we have a rationale for that we say they do this bad thing that make it just that they should go to prison none of we really extend the golden rule in truly diffuse and universal fashion we have the capacity to carve out exception put person in a special category and the problem be that although in the case of send person to prison you have this impartial judiciary determine who get exclude from the golden rule that in everyday life the way we all make this decision about who we be not go to extend the golden rule to be we use a much rough and ready formula basically it be just like if you be my enemy if you be my rival if you be not my friend if you be not in my family I be much less inclined to apply the golden rule to you we all do that and you see it all over the world you see it in the Middle East person who from Gaza be fire missile at Israel they would not want to have missile fire at they but they say well but the Israeli or some of they have do thing that put they in a special category the Israeli would not want to have a economic blockade impose on they but they impose one on Gaza and they say well the Palestinian or some of they have bring this on themselves so it be this exclusion to the golden rule that amount to a lot of the world trouble and it be natural to do that so the fact that the golden rule be in some sense build in to we be not by itself go to bring we universal love it be not go to save the world now there be one piece of good news I have that may save the world okay be you on the edge of you seat here good because before I tell you about that good news I be go to have to take a little excursion through some academic terrain so I hope I have get you attention with this promise of good news that may save the world it be this non zero sumness stuff you just hear a little bit about it be just a quick introduction to game theory this will not hurt okay it be about zero sum and non zero sum game if you ask what kind of a situation be conducive to person become friend and ally the technical answer be a non zero sum situation and if you ask what kind of situation be conducive to person define person as enemy it be a zero sum situation so what do that term mean basically a zero sum game be the kind you be use to in sport where there be a winner and a loser so they fortune add up to zero so in tennis every point be either good for you and bad for the other person or good for they bad for you either way you fortune add up to zero that be a zero sum game now if you be play double then the person on you side of the net be in a non zero sum relationship with you because every point be either good for both of you positive win win or bad for both of you it be lose lose that be a non zero sum game and in real life there be lot of non zero sum game in the realm of economics say if you buy something that mean you have rather have the merchandise than the money but the merchant would rather have the money than the merchandise you both feel you have win in a war two ally be play a non zero sum game it be go to either be win win or lose lose for they so there be lot of non zero sum game in real life and you could basically reformulate what I say early about how compassion be deploy and the golden rule be deploy by just say well compassion most naturally flow along non zero sum channel where person perceive themselves as be in a potentially win win situation with some of they friend or ally the deployment of the golden rule most naturally happen along this non zero sum channel so kind of web of non zero sumness be where you would expect compassion and the golden rule to kind of work they magic with zero sum channel you would expect something else okay so now you be ready for the good news that I say might save the world and now I can admit that it might not too now that I have hold you attention for three minute of technical stuff but it may and the good news be that history have naturally expand this web of non zero sumness this web that can be this channel for compassion you can go back all the way to the stone age technological evolution road the wheel write a lot of transportation and communication technology have just inexorably make it so that more person can be in more non zero sum relationship with more and more person at great and great distance that be the story of civilization it be why social organization have grow from the hunter gatherer village to the ancient state the empire and now here we be in a globalize world and the story of globalization be largely a story of non zero sumness you have probably hear the term interdependence apply to the modern world well that be just another term for non zero sum if you fortune be interdependent with somebody then you live in a non zero sum relationship with they and you see this all the time in the modern world you see it with the recent economic crash where bad thing happen in the economy bad for everybody for much of the world good thing happen and it be good for much of the world and you know I be happy to say I think there be really evidence that this non zero sum kind of connection can expand the moral compass I mean if you look at the American attitude toward Japanese during World War II look at the depiction of Japanese in the American media as just about subhuman and look at the fact that we drop atomic bomb really without give it much of a thought and you compare that to the attitude now I think part of that be due to a kind of economic interdependence any form of interdependence or non zero sum relationship force you to acknowledge the humanity of person so I think that be good and the world be full of non zero sum dynamics environmental problem in many way put we all in the same boat and there be non zero sum relationship that maybe person be not aware of for example probably a lot of American Christian do not think of themselves as be in a non zero sum relationship with Muslim halfway around the world but they really be because if this Muslim become happy and happy with they place in the world and feel that they have a place in it that be good for American because there will be few terrorist to threaten American security if they get less and less happy that will be bad for American so there be plenty of non zero sumness and so the question be if there be so much non zero sumness why have the world not yet be suffuse in love peace and understanding the answer complicated it be the occasion for a whole other talk certainly a couple of thing be that first of all there be a lot of zero sum situation in the world and also sometimes person do not recognize the non zero sum dynamics in the world in both of this area I think politician can play a role this be not only about religion I think politician can help foster non zero sum relationship economic engagement be generally good than blockade and so on in this regard and politician can be aware and should be aware that when person around the world be look at they be look at they nation and pick up they cue for whether they be in a zero sum or a non zero sum relationship with a nation like say America or any other nation human psychology be such that they use cue like do we feel we be be respect because you know historically if you be not be respect you be probably not go to wind up in a non zero sum mutually profitable relationship with person so we need to be aware of what kind of signal we be send out and some of this again be in the realm of political work if there be one thing I can encourage everyone to do politician religious leader and we it would be what I call expand the moral imagination that be to say you ability to put yourself in the shoe of person in very different circumstance this be not the same as compassion but it be conducive to compassion it open the channel for compassion and I be afraid we have another good news bad news story which be that the moral imagination be part of human nature that be good but again we tend to deploy it selectively once we define somebody as a enemy we have trouble put ourselves in they shoe just naturally so if you want to take a particularly hard case for a American somebody in Iran who be burn a American flag and you see they on TV well the average American be go to resist the moral exercise of put themselves in that person head and be go to resist the idea that they have much in common with that person and if you tell they well they think America disrespect they and even want to dominate they and they hate America have there ever be somebody who disrespect you so much that you kind of hate they briefly you know they will resist that comparison and that be natural that be human and similarly the person in Iran when you try to humanize somebody in America who say that Islam be evil they will have trouble with that so it be a very difficult thing to get person to expand the moral imagination to a place it do not naturally go I think it be worth the trouble because again it just help we to understand if you want to reduce the number of person who be burn flag it help to understand what make they do it and I think it be good moral exercise I would say here be where religious leader come in because religious leader be good at reframe issue for person at harness the emotional center of the brain to get person to alter they awareness and reframe the way they think I mean religious leader be kind of in the inspiration business it be they great calling right now to get person all around the world well at expand they moral imagination appreciate that in so many way they be in the same boat I would just sum up the way thing look at least from this secular perspective as far as compassion and the golden rule go by say that it be good news that compassion and the golden rule be in some sense build into human nature it be unfortunate that they tend to be selectively deploy and it be go to take real work to change that but nobody ever say that do God work be go to be easy thanks applause
