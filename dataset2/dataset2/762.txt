I be go to talk to you about power in this 21st century and basically what I would like to tell you be that power be change and there be two type of change I want to discuss one be power transition which be change of power amongst state and there the simple version of the message be it be move from West to East the other be power diffusion the way power be move from all state West or East to non state actor that two thing be the huge shift of power in we century and I want to tell you about they each separately and then how they interact and why in the end there may be some good news when we talk about power transition we often talk about the rise of Asia it really should be call the recovery or return of Asia if we look at the world in 1800 you would find that more than half of the world person live in Asia and they make more than half the world product now fast forward to 1900 half the world person more than half still live in Asia but they be now make only a fifth of the world product what happen the Industrial Revolution which mean that all of a sudden Europe and America become the dominant center of the world what we be go to see in the 21st century be Asia gradually return to be more than half of the world population and more than half of the world product that be important and it be a important shift but let I tell you a little bit about the other shift that I be talk about which be power diffusion to understand power diffusion put this in you mind computing and communication cost have fall a thousandfold between 1970 and the beginning of this century now that be a big abstract number but to make it more real if the price of a automobile have fall as rapidly as the price of compute power you could buy a car today for five dollar now when the price of any technology decline that dramatically the barrier to entry go down anybody can play in the game so in 1970 if you want to communicate from Oxford to Johannesburg to New Delhi to Brasilia and anywhere simultaneously you could do it the technology be there but to be able to do it you have to be very rich a government a multinational corporation maybe the Catholic Church but you have to be pretty wealthy now anybody have that capacity which previously be restrict by price just to a few actor if they have the price of entry into a internet cafe the last time I look it be something like a pound a hour and if you have Skype it be free so capability that be once restrict be now available to everyone and what that meansis not that the age of the state be over the state still matter but the stage be crowd the state be not alone there be many many actor some of that be good Oxfam a great non governmental actor some of it be bad Al Qaeda another non governmental actor but think of what it do to how we think in traditional term and concept we think in term of war and interstate war and you can think back to 1941 when the government of Japan attack the United States at Pearl Harbor it be worth notice that a non state actor attack the United States in 2001 kill more American than the government of Japan do in 1941 you might think of that as the privatization of war so we be see a great change in term of diffusion of power now the problem be that we be not think about it in very innovative way so let I step back and ask what be power power be simple the ability to affect other to get the outcome you want and you can do it in three way you can do it with threat of coercion stick you can do it with payment carrot or you can do it by get other to want what you want and that ability to get other to want what you want to get the outcome you want without coercion or payment be what I call soft power and that soft power have be much neglect and much misunderstand and yet it be tremendously important indeed if you can learn to use more soft power you can save a lot on carrot and stick traditionally the way person think about power be primarily in term of military power for example the great Oxford historian who teach here at this university a j p Taylor define a great power as a country able to prevail in war but we need a new narrative if we be to understand power in the 21st century it be not just prevail at war though war still persist it be not whose army win it be also whose story win and we have to think much more in term of narrative and whose narrative be go to be effective now let I go back to the question of power transition between state and what be happen there the narrative that we use now tend to be the rise and fall of the great power and the current narrative be all about the rise of China and the decline of the United States indeed with the 2008 financial crisis many person say this be the beginning of the end of American power the tectonic plate of world politics be shift and president Medvedev of Russia for example pronounce in 2008 this be the beginning of the end of United States power but in fact this metaphor of decline be often very misleading if you look at history in recent history you will see the cycle of belief in American decline come and go every 10 or 15 year or so in 1958 after the Soviets put up Sputnik it be that be the end of America in 1973 with the oil embargo and the closing of the gold window that be the end of America in the 1980 as America go through a transition in the Reagan period between the rust belt economy of the midwest to the Silicon Valley economy of California that be the end of America but in fact what we have see be none of that be true indeed person be over enthusiastic in the early 2000 think America could do anything which lead we into some disastrous foreign policy adventure and now we be back to decline again the moral of this story be all this narrative about rise and fall and decline tell we a lot more about psychology than they do about reality if we try to focus on the reality then what we need to focus on be what be really happen in term of China and the United States Goldman Sachs have project that China the Chinese economy will surpass that of the U S by 2027 so we have get what 17 more year to go or so before China big now someday with a billion point three person get rich they be go to be big than the United States but be very careful about this projection such as the Goldman Sachs projection as though that give you a accurate picture of power transition in this century let I mention three reason why it be too simple First of all it be a linear projection you know everything say here be the growth rate of China here be the growth rate of the U S here it go straight line history be not linear there be often bump along the road accident along the way the second thing be that the Chinese economy pass the U S economy in let say 2030 which it may it that will be a measure of total economic size but not of per capita income will not tell you about the composition of the economy China still have large area of underdevelopment and per capita income be a good measure of the sophistication of the economy and that the Chinese will not catch up or pass the American until somewhere in the latter part after 2050 of this century the other point that be worth notice be how one dimensional this projection be you know it look at economic power measure by GDP do not tell you much about military power do not tell you very much about soft power it be all very one dimensional and also when we think about the rise of Asia or return of Asia as I call it a little bit early it be worth remember Asia not one thing if you be sit in Japan or in New Delhi or in Hanoi you view of the rise of China be a little different than if you be sit in Beijing indeed one of the advantage that the American will have in term of power in Asia be all that country want a American insurance policy against the rise of China it be as though Mexico and Canada be hostile neighbor to the United States which they be not so this simple projection of the Goldman Sachs type be not tell we what we need to know about power transition but you might ask well so what in any case why do it matter who care be this just a game that diplomat and academic play the answer be it matter quite a lot because if you believe in decline and you get the answer wrong on this the fact not the myth you may have policy which be very dangerous let I give you a example from history the peloponnesian war be the great conflict in which the Greek city state system tear itself apart two and a half millennia ago what cause it Thucydides the great historian of the the Peloponnesian War say it be the rise in the power of Athens and the fear it create in Sparta Notice both half of that explanation many person argue that the 21st century be go to repeat the 20th century in which World War One the great conflagration in which the European state system tear itself apart and destroy its centrality in the world that that be cause by the rise in the power of Germany and the fear it create in Britain so there be person who be tell we this be go to be reproduce today that what we be go to see be the same thing now in this century no I think that be wrong it be bad history for one thing Germany have surpass Britain in industrial strength by 1900 and as I say early China have not pass the United States but also if you have this belief and it create a sense of fear it lead to overreaction and the great danger we have of manage this power transition of the shift toward the East be fear to paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt from a different context the great thing we have to fear be fear itself we do not have to fear the rise of China or the return of Asia and if we have policy in which we take it in that large historical perspective we be go to be able to manage this process let I say a word now about the distribution of power and how it relate to power diffusion and then pull this two type together if you ask how be power distribute in the world today it be distribute much like a three dimensional chess game top board military power among state the United States be the only superpower and it be likely to remain that way for two or three decade China be not go to replace the U S on this military board Middle board of this three dimensional chess game economic power among state power be multi polar there be balancer the U S Europe China Japan can balance each other the bottom board of this three dimensional the board of transnational relation thing that cross border outside the control of government thing like climate change drug trade financial flow pandemic all this thing that cross border outside the control of government there nobody be in charge it make no sense to call this unipolar or multi polar power be chaotically distribute and the only way you can solve this problem and this be where many great challenge be come in this century be through cooperation through work together which mean that soft power become more important that ability to organize network to deal with this kind of problem and to be able to get cooperation another way of put it be that as we think of power in the 21st century we want to get away from the idea that power always zero sum my gain be you loss and vice versa power can also be positive sum where you gain can be my gain if China develop great energy security and great capacity to deal with its problem of carbon emission that be good for we as well as good for China as well as good for everybody else so empower China to deal with its own problem of carbon be good for everybody and it be not a zero sum I win you lose it be one in which we can all gain so as we think about power in this century we want to get away from this view that it be all I win you lose now I do not mean to be pollyannaish about this war persist power persist military power be important keep balance be important all this still persist hard power be there and it will remain but unless you learn how to mix hard power with soft power into strategy that I call smart power you be not go to deal with the new kind of problem that we be face so the key question that we need to think about as we look at this be how do we work together to produce global public goods thing from which all of we can benefit how do we define we national interest so that it be not just zero sum but positive sum in that sense if we define we interest for example for the United States the way Britain define its interest in the 19th century keep a open trading system keep a monetary stability keep freedom of the sea that be good for Britain they be good for other as well and in the 21st century you have to do a analog to that how do we produce global public goods which be good for we but good for everyone at the same time and that be go to be the good news dimension of what we need to think about as we think of power in the 21st century there be way to define we interest in which while protect ourselves with hard power we can organize with other in network to produce not only public goods but way that will enhance we soft power so if one look at the statement that have be make about this I be impressed that when Hillary Clinton describe the foreign policy of the Obama administration she say that the foreign policy of the Obama administration be go to be smart power as she put it use all the tool in we foreign policy tool box and if we be go to deal with this two great power shift that I have describe the power shift represent by transition among state the power shift represent by diffusion of power away from all state we be go to have to develop a new narrative of power in which we combine hard and soft power into strategy of smart power and that be the good news I have we can do that thank you very much applause
