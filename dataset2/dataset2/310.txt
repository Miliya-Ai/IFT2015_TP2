you hear that this be the era of environment or biology or information technology well it be the era of a lot of different thing that we be in right now but one thing for sure it be the era of change there be more change go on than ever have occur in the history of human life on earth and you all sort of know it but it be hard to get it so that you really understand it and I have try to put together something that be a good start for this I have try to show in this though the color do not come out that what I be concern with be the little 50 year time bubble that you be in you tend to be interested in a generation past a generation future you parent you kid thing you can change over the next few decade and this 50 year time bubble you kind of move along in and in that 50 year if you look at the population curve you find the population of human on the earth more than double and we be up three and a half time since I be bear when you have a new baby by the time that kid get out of high school more person will be add than exist on earth when I be bear this be unprecedented and it be big where it go in the future be question so that be the human part now the human part relate to animal look at the left side of that what I call the human portion human and they livestock and pet versus the natural portion all the other wild animal and just this be vertebrate and all the bird etc in the land and air not in the water how do it balance certainly 10 000 year ago the civilization begin the human portion be less than one tenth of one percent let look at it now you follow this curve and you see the white spot in the middle that be you 50 year time bubble human livestock and pet be now 97 percent of that integrate total mass on earth and all wild nature be three percent we have win the next generation do not even have to worry about this game it be over and the big problem come in the last 25 year it go from 25 percent up to that 97 percent and this really be a sobering picture upon realize that we human be in charge of life on earth we be like the capricious god of old Greek myth kind of play with life and not a great deal of wisdom inject into it now the third curve be information technology this be Moore Law plot here which relate to density of information but it have be pretty good for show a lot of other thing about information technology computer they use internet etc and what be important be it just go straight up through the top of the curve and have no real limit to it now try and contrast this this be the size of the earth go through that same laughter frame and to make it really clear I have put all four on one graph there be no need to see the little detailed word on it that first one be human versus nature we have win there be no more gain human population and so if you be look for growth industry to get into that be not a good one protect natural creature human population be go up it be go to continue for quite a while good business in obstetrician mortician and farm housing etc they all deal with human body which require be feed transport house and so on and the information technology which connect to we brain have no limit now that be a wonderful field to be in you be look for growth opportunity it be just go up through the roof and then the size of the Earth somehow make this all compatible with the Earth look like a pretty bad industry to be involve with so that be the stage out of all this I find for reason I do not understand I really do have a goal and the goal be that the world be desirable and sustainable when my kid reach my age and I think that be in other word the next generation I think that be a goal that we probably all share I think it be a hopeless goal technologically it be achievable economically it be achievable politically it mean sort of the habit institution of person it be impossible the institution of the past with all they inertia be just irrelevant for the future except they be there and we have to deal with they I spend about 15 percent of my time try to save the world the other 85 percent the usual and whatever else we devote ourselves to and in that 15 percent the main focus be on human mind think skill somehow try to unleash kid from the straightjacket of school which be put information and dogma into they get they so they really think ask tough question argue about serious subject do not believe everything that be in the book think broadly or creative they can be we school system be very flawed and do not reward you for the thing that be important in life or for the survival of civilization they reward you for a lot of learning and sop up stuff we can not go into that today because there be not time it be a broad subject one thing for sure in the future there be a essential feature necessary but not sufficient which be do more with less we have get to be do thing with more efficiency use less energy less material you great great grandparent get by on muscle power and yet we all think there be this huge power that be essential for we lifestyle and with all the wonderful technology we have we can do thing that be much more efficient conserve recycle etc let I just rush very quickly through thing that we have do human powered airplane Gossamer Condor sort of start I in this direction in 1976 and 77 win the Kremer prize in aviation history follow by the Albatross and we begin make various odd plane and creature here be a giant fly replica of a pterosaur that have no tail try to have it fly straight be like try to shoot a arrow with the feathered end forward it be a tough job and boy it make I have a lot of respect for nature this be the full size of the original creature we do thing on land in the air on water vehicle of all different kind usually with some electronics or electric power system in they I find they be all the same whether its land air or water I will be focus on the air here this be a solar powered airplane 165 mile carry a person from France to England as a symbol that solar power be go to be a important part of we future then we do the solar car for General Motors the Sunracer that win the race in Australia we get a lot of person think about electric car what you could do with they a few year later when we suggest to GM that now be the time and we could do a thing call the impact they sponsor it and here be the impact that we develop with they on they program this be the demonstrator and they put huge effort into turn it into a commercial product with that preamble let show the first two minute videotape which show a little airplane for surveillance and move to a giant airplane Narrator A tiny airplane the av pointer serve for surveillance in effect a pair of rove eyeglass a cut edge example of where miniaturization can lead if the operator be remote from the vehicle it be convenient to carry assemble and launch by hand battery power it be silent and rarely notice it send high resolution video picture back to the operator with onboard GPS it can navigate autonomously and it be rugged enough to self land without damage the modern sailplane be superbly efficient some can glide as flat as 60 foot forward for every foot of descent they be power only by the energy they can extract from the atmosphere a atmosphere nature stir up by solar energy human and soar bird have find nature to be generous in provide replenishable energy sailplane have fly over 1 000 mile and the altitude record be over 50 000 foot music the Solar Challenger be make to serve as a symbol that photovoltaic cell can produce real power and will be part of the world energy future in 1981 it fly 163 mile from Paris to England solely on the power of sunbeam and establish a basis for the Pathfinder Music the message from all this vehicle be that idea and technology can be harness to produce remarkable gain in do more with less gain that can help we attain a desirable balance between technology and nature the stake be high as we speed toward a challenging future Buckminster Fuller say it clearly there be no passenger on spaceship Earth only crew we the crew can and must do more with less much less Paul MacCready if we could have the second video the one minute put in as quickly as you can which this will show the Pathfinder airplane in some flight this past year in Hawaii and will show a sequence of some of the beauty behind it after it have just fly to 71 530 foot high than any propeller airplane have ever fly it be amazing just on the puny power of the sun by have a super lightweight plane you be able to get it up there it be part of a long term program NASA sponsor and we work very closely with the whole thing be a team effort and with wonderful result like that flight and we be work on a big plane 220 foot span and a intermediate size one with a regenerative fuel cell that can store excess energy during the day feed it back at night and stay up 65 000 foot for month at a time music Ray Morgan voice will come in here there he be the project manager anything they do be certainly a team effort he run this program here be some thing he show as a celebration at the very end Ray Morgan we would just end a seven month deployment of Hawaii for that who live on the mainland it be tough be away from home the friendly support the quiet confidence congenial hospitality show by we hawaiian and military host music this be start make the experience enjoyable and unforgettable pm we have real time ir scan go out through the internet while the plane be fly and it be explore without pollute the stratosphere that be its goal the stratosphere the blanket that really control the radiation of the earth and permit life on earth to be the success that it be probe that be very important and also we consider it as a sort of poor man stationary satellite because it can stay right overhead for month at a time 2 000 time close than the real GFC synchronous satellite we could not bring one here to fly it and show you but now let look at the other end in the video you see that nine pound or eight pound pointer airplane surveillance drone that Keenan have develop and just do a remarkable job where some have servo that have get down to oh 18 or 25 gram he weigh one third of a gram and what he be go to bring out here be a surveillance drone that weigh about 2 ounce that include the video camera the battery that run it the telemetry the receiver and so on and we will fly it we hope with the same success that we have last night when we do the practice so Matt Keenan just any time you be all right ready to let she go but first we be go to make sure that it be appear on the screen so you see what it see you can imagine yourself be a mouse or fly inside of it look out of its camera Matt Keenan it be switch on pm but now we be try to get the video there we go MK can you bring up the house light pm yeah the house light and we will see you all well and be able to fly the plane good MK all right we will try to do a few lap around and bring it back in here we go applause pm the video work right for the first few and I do not know why it there it go oh that be only a minute but I think you would be safe to have that near the end of the flight perhaps we get to do the classic all right if this hit you it will not hurt you laughter ok applause thank you very much thank you applause but now as they say in infomercial we have something much good for you which we be work on plane that be only six inch 15 centimeter in size and Matt plane be on the cover of Popular Science last month show what this can lead to and in a while something this size will have gp and a video camera in it we have have one of this fly nine mile through the air at 35 mile a hour with just a little battery in it but there be a lot of technology go there be just milestone along the way of some remarkable thing this one do not have the video in it but you get a little feel from what it can do ok here we go laughter MK sorry ok applause pm if you can pass it down when you be do yeah I think I lose a little orientation I look up into this light it hit the building and the building be poorly place actually laughter but you be begin to see what can be do we be work on project now even wing flap thing the size of hawk moth DARPA contract work with Caltech UCLA where all this lead I do not know be it practical I do not know but like any basic research when you be really force to do thing that be way beyond exist technology you can get there with micro technology nanotechnology you can do amazing thing when you realize what nature have be do all along as you get to this small scale you realize we have a lot to learn from nature not with 747 but when you get down to the nature realm nature have 200 million year of experience it never make a mistake because if you make a mistake you do not leave any progeny we should have nothing but success story from nature for you or for bird and we be learn a lot from its fascinating subject in conclude I want to get back to the big picture and I have just two final slide to try and put it in perspective the first I will just read at last I put in three sentence and have it say what I want over billion of year on a unique sphere chance have paint a thin covering of life complex improbable wonderful and fragile suddenly we human a recently arrive species no long subject to the check and balance inherent in nature have grow in population technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power we now wield the paintbrush and that be serious we be not very bright we be short on wisdom we be high on technology where be it go to lead well inspire by the sentence I decide to wield the paintbrush every 25 year I do a picture here be the one try to show that the world be not get any big sort of a timeline very non linear scale nature rate and trilobite and dinosaur and eventually we see some human with cave bird be fly overhead after pterosaur and then we get to the civilization above the little tv set with a gun on it then traffic jam and power system and some dot for digital where it be go to lead I have no idea and so I just put robotic and natural cockroach out there but you can fill in whatever you want this be not a forecast this be a warning and we have to think seriously about it and that time when this be happen be not 100 year or 500 year thing be go on this decade next decade it be a very short time that we have to decide what we be go to do and if we can get some agreement on where we want the world to be desirable sustainable when you kid reach you age I think we actually can reach it now I say this be a warning not a forecast that be before I paint this before we start in on make robotic version of hawk moth and cockroach and now I be begin to wonder seriously be this more of a forecast than I want I personally think the survive intelligent life form on earth be not go to be carbon base it be go to be silicon base and so where it all go I do not know the one final bit of sparkle we will put in at the very end here be a utterly impractical flight vehicle which be a little ornithopter wing flap device that rubber band power that we will show you MK 32 gram sorry one gram pm last night we give it a few too many turn and it try to bash the roof out also it be about a gram the tube there be hollow about paper thin and if this land on you I assure you it will not hurt you but if you reach out to grab it or hold it you will destroy it so be gentle just act like a wooden Indian or something and when it come down and we will see how it go we consider this to be sort of the spirit of TED applause and you wonder be it practical and it turn out if I have not be laughter applause unfortunately we have some light bulb change we can probably get it down but it be possible it be go up to a great destiny up there laughter than it ever have and I want to make applause just applause but I want to make just two point one be you think it be frivolous there be nothing to it and yet if I have not be make ornithopter like that a little bit crude in 1939 a long long time ago there would not have be a Gossamer Condor there would not have be a Albatross a Solar Challenger there would not be a impact car there would not be a mandate on zero emission vehicle in California A lot of this thing or similar would have happen some time probably a decade later I do not realize at the time I be do inquiry base hand on thing with team like they be try to get in education system so I think that as a symbol it be important and I believe that also be important you can think of it as a sort of a symbol for learn and TED that somehow get you think of technology and nature and put it all together in thing that be that make this conference I think more important than any that be take place in this country in this decade thank you applause
