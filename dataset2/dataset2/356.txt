sixty five million year ago a very important and catastrophic event change the course of life on land and although we know that the land animal I be go to talk about be just the scum of the Earth on the land the little bit of land float around but they be important to we because they be sort of in we scale of experience from millimeter to meter and this animal disappear and a separate life mammal radiate out to take they place and so we know this in extraordinary detail and so this be a core from near Bermuda we know that the tsunamis the earthquake and the thing that we have experience in the entire record of humankind history can not really quite get around the kind of disaster that this represent for the Earth so even before that impact be know even before scientist in general come to a agreement over the theory of evolution scientist and natural historian of all kind of stripe actually have divide Earth life history into this two episode mesozoic the middle life and the Cenozoic the recent life and as it turn out it actually correspond really nicely with geologic history so we have a mesozoic period a age of fragmentation and a cenozoic period a age of reconnection South America to North America India to Asia and so my work really be try to understand the character of that mesozoic radiation compare to the cenozoic radiation to see what mystery we can understand from dinosaur and from other animal about what life on drift continent really can tell we about evolution the work immediately beg the question why do not they go into the water I mean certainly mammal do this be one example you can go outside see many other example within five 10 million year of the bolide impact we have a whole variety of animal go into the water why do not they do that why do not they hang around in tree at good size and why do not they burrow why do not they do all this thing and if they do not do all this thing what kind of animal be in that space and if there be no animal in that space what do that tell we about you know how evolution work on land really interesting question I think a lot of it have to do with body size in fact I think that most of it have to do with body size the size you be when you inherit a vacant ecospace from whatever natural disaster look at dinosaur evolution and study it dig it up for many year I end up look at the mammal radiation and it seem as though everything be quick time just like technology advance by a order of magnitude dinosaur evolution proceed at a stately pace a order of magnitude slow on any way you want to measure it you want to measure it by diversity you want to measure it by the time it take to reach maximum body size yes they do have large body size but many of they be small but we be interested in the time it take they to achieve that fifty million year to achieve this maximum body size and that be 10 time long than it take the mammal to achieve maximum body size and invade all that habitat so there be lesson to learn and there be lesson to learn from the exception the exception that we know very well today from the discovery we have make and many other scholar have make around the world this slide be show before this be the famous jurassic bird Archaeopteryx we now know this transition be the one time that dinosaur actually go below that body size we be go to see where they begin in a minute and it be the one time that they rapidly invade all the habitat I just tell you that dinosaur be not in they become marine we now know they today from the ice cap there be burrow bird they inhabit the tree at all body size and of course they inhabit the land so we be the first to actually name a bird from the famous series that later explode onto the page of Science and Nature we call this bird Sinornis it be a little bit more advanced than Archaeopteryx and if you go to different layer you find thing that be less advanced than Archaeopteryx and every grade in between so that if you find something today we be usually splitting hair or more appropriately feather as to decide whether it be actually a non avian or a avian it be the great transition that we have actually on land from one habitat to another bar none to understand how a bony fairly heavy kilogram or a couple of kilogram animal could make such a transition it be really we great one of we great evolutionary sequence now my work begin at the beginning I think if I be go to understand dinosaur evolution I would have to go back to that bed where they have pick up fragment go back to a time and a place where the early dinosaur exist I would like to call for this little video clip to give you some idea of sort of what we face normally we get ask a lot of question well how do you find fossil in area that look like this if we could roll that first video clip this be sort of a nice helicopter ride through that early bed and they be locate in northeastern Argentina and we be come over a cliff and at the top of that cliff dinosaur have basically take over at the bottom of the cliff we find that they be rare as hen tooth that be where dinosaur origin be to be find at the bottom of the cliff you go into a area like this you get a geologic map you get a topographic map and the good most inspired team you can bring to the area and the rest be up to you you have get to find fossil you have get to dig a hole that be usually quite a bit big than that to get it out you have get to climb that cliff and find really everything that exist not just the dinosaur but the entire story if you be lucky and you dig a place like that you actually find the ash bed to dig it and we do 228 million year old we find what really be the most primitive dinosaur that be the ur dinosaur a three and a half foot thing beautiful skull predator meat eater a two legged animal so all the other dinosaur that you know or you kid know at least on four leg this be sort of a look at the skull and it be a absolutely fantastic thing about five or six inch long it look rather bird like because it be it be bird like and hollow a predator maybe 25 pound or 10 kilogram that be where dinosaur begin that be where the radiation begin that be 10 time large than the mammal radiation which be a four legged radiation we be extremely dinosaur like and unusual in we two legged approach to life now if you want to understand what happen then when the continent break apart and dinosaur find landlubber as they be find themselves adrift there be some missing puzzle piece most of that miss puzzle piece be southern continent because it be that continent that be least explore if you want to add to this picture and try and sketch it globally you really have to force yourself to go down to the four corner of the Earth Africa India Antarctica Australia and start put together some of this piece I have be to some of that continent but Africa be in the word of Steven Pinker be a blank slate largely but one with a immense chalkboard in the middle with lot of little area of dinosaur rock if you could survive a expedition there be no road into the Sahara it be a enormous place to be able to excavate the 80 ton of dinosaur that we have in the Sahara and take they out you really have to put together a expedition team that can handle the condition some of they be political many of they be physical some of they the most important be mental and you really have to be able to withstand condition you have to drive into the desert you will see landscape in many case you can see from what we have discover that nobody else have ever see and the kind of team they bring in well they be compose of person who understand science as adventure with a purpose they be usually student who have never see a desert some of they be more experienced you job as a leader this be definitely a team sport you job as a leader be to try to inspire they to do more work than they have ever do in they life under condition that they can not imagine so 125 degree be normal the ground surface at 150 typical so you can not leave you normal metal tool out because you will get a first degree burn if you grab they sometimes so you be find yourself also in a amazing cultural milieu you be really rub shoulder with the world last great nomadic person this be the Tuareg nomad and they be live they life much as they have for century you job be to excavate thing like this in the foreground and make they enter the page of history to do that you have get to actually transport they thousand of mile out of the desert we be talk about Ethiopia but let talk about Niger or Niger in we English language north of Nigeria that be where this photograph be take basically you be talk about a country that when we start work there do not have container traffic you transport the bone out yourself to the coast of Africa onto a boat if you want to get they out of the middle of the Sahara that be a 2 000 mile journey so enormous excavation and a lot of work and out of essentially a partial herd of dinosaur that you see bury there 20 ton of material we erect Jobaria a sauropod dinosaur like we have not see on some other continent it really be a little bit out of place temporally it look nothing like what we would find if we dig in contemporary bed in North America here be the animal that be cause it trouble and you know on and on a whole menagerie when you pick up something like this and some of you have have the chance to touch it this be a piece of history you be touch something that be 110 million year old this be a thumb claw there it be moment after it be discover it be a incredible view of life and it really begin when we begin to understand the depth of time it be only be with we for less than a century and in that time that fourth dimension when radioactive dating come about less than a century ago and we could actually tell how old some of this thing be be probably the most profound transformation because it change the way we look at ourselves and the world dramatically when you pick up a piece of history like that I think it can transform kid that be possibly interested in science that be the animal that thumb claw come from Suchomimus here be some other this be something we find in Morocco a immense animal we prototype by cat scan the brain out of this animal it turn out to have a forebrain one fifteenth the size of a human this be the cover of Science because they think that human be more intelligent than this animal but we can see by some in we administration that despite the enormous advantage in brain volume some of the attitude remain the same anyway small raptor all the stuff from jurassic park that you know of all that small animal they all come from northern continent this be the first skeleton from a southern continent and guess what you start prepare it it have no big claw on its hind foot it do not look like a Velociraptor it be really a wholly separate radiation so what we be try to piece together here be a story it involve fly reptile like this pterosaur that we reconstruct from Africa Crocodiles of course and that be a nasty one we have not name yet and huge thing I mean this be a low jaw just lay there in the desert of this enormous crocodile the crocodile be technically call Sarcosuchus that be a adult Orinoco crocodile in its jaw we have to try and reconstruct this we have to actually look at recent crocodile to understand how crocodile scale could I have the second little video clip now this field be just and of course science in general be just adventure we have to find and measure the large crocodile live today Narrator as long as they boat Man look at that set of chopper yeah he be a big one Narrator if they can just land it this croc will provide useful datum help Paul in he quest to understand Sarcosuchus Man ok hand I some more here Man 2 ok Narrator it fall to Paul to cover its eye Man watch out watch out no no no no you be go to have to get on the back leg Man I get the back leg Man 2 you have the back leg no you have the front leg my friend I have get it I have get the back leg somebody get the front leg Paul Sereno let get this tape measure on he put it right there wow sixty five wow that be a big skull Narrator Big but less than half the size of supercroc skull man enormous PS you have get a 14 foot croc man I know it be big PS do not get off you do not get off but do not worry about I Narrator Paul have he datum so they decide to release the animal back into the river ps do not get off do not get off do not get off Narrator Paul have never see a fossil do that PS okay when I say three we move one two three whoa so there be applause well you know the the fossil record be truly amazing because it really force you to look at live animal in a new way we prove with that measurement that crocodile scale isometrically it depend on the shape of they skull though so we have to actually get that measurement to be sure that we have reconstruct and could prove to the scientific world that supercroc in fact be a 40 foot crocodile probably a male anyway you find other thing too I be go to lead a expedition to the Sahara to dig up Africa large neolithic site we find this last year two hundred skeleton tool jewelry this be a ceremonial disk a amazing record of the colonization of the Sahara 5 000 year ago be be sit out there wait for we to go back so really exciting and then work later be go to take we to Tibet now we normally think of Tibet as a highland it be really a island continent it be a precursor to India a messenger from Gondwana a lose paradise of dinosaur isolate for million of year no one find they we know where they be and we be go to go and get they next year they be only between 13 and 14 000 foot but if you go in the warm part of the year it be o k now I try to suture together a dinosaur evolutionary history so that we can try to understand some basic pattern of evolution I have talk about a few of they we really need to take that further we need to delve into this mass of anatomy that we have be compile to understand where the change be occur and what this mean we can not predict necessarily what will happen in evolution but we can learn some of the rule of the game and that be really what we be try to do with regard to the biogeographic question the Earth be divide this be all landlubb animal there be a couple of choice you get divide and a continent division correspond to a fork in the evolutionary tree or you be crafty and you manage to escape from one to the other and erase that division or you be live peacefully on each side and on one side you just go extinct and you survive on the other side and create a difference and the fourth thing be that you actually do one or the other of that three thing but the paleontologist never find you and you take that four instance and you realize you have a complex problem and so in addition to dig I think we have some answer from the dinosaur record I think this dinosaur migrate we call it dispersal around the globe with the slight land bridge they do it within two or three degree of the pole to maintain similarity between continent but when they be divide indeed they be divide and we do see the continent carve difference among dinosaur but there be one thing that be even more important and I think that be extinction we have downgrade this factor it carve up the history of life and give we the difference that we see in the dinosaur world towards the end right before the bolide impact the good way to test this be to actually create a model so if we move back this be a two dimensional typical tree of life I want to give you three dimension so you see the tree of life but now I have add the dimension of area so the tree of life be normally divergence over time now we have divergence over time but we have create the third dimension of area this be a computer program which have three knob we can control that thing that we be worried about extinction sampling dispersal go from one area to another and ultimately we can control the branching to mimic what we think the continent be like and run it a thousand time so we can estimate the parameter to answer the question whether we be on the mark or not at least to know the barrier of the problem so that be a little bit about the science today I be go to spend the rest of my few minute up here talk about the other stuff that I do in Chicago which be relate to the fact that I never and actually in talk to a lot of tedster there be a number of you out there I do not know that I would get a answer honestly if I ask you to raise you hand but there be a number of you out there that start you scientific technical entertainment career as failure by society standard as failure by school I be one of that I be fail by my school my school fail I who be point finger several teacher nearly kill I I find myself in art I be a total failure in school not really head to graduate high school and I go on that be my first painting on canvas I read a dictionary I get into college I become a artist o k and start draw it become abstract I work up a portfolio and I be head to New York sometimes I would see bone when there be a body there something be go on in the background I head to New York to a studio I take a side trip to the American Museum and I never recover but really it be the same discipline they be kindred discipline I mean be there anything that be not visualize what can not be see in term of discover this dinosaur bone from a small piece of it that be out there or see the distortion that we try to see as evolutionary distortion in one animal to another this be a very extraordinarily visual I give you a human face because you be expert at that it take we year to understand how to do that with dinosaur they be really kindred discipline but what we be try to create in Chicago be a way to get collect together that student who be least represent in we science and technology sphere we all know and there be be several allusion to it that we be fail in we ability to produce enough scientist engineer and technician we have know that for a long time we have go through the Sputnik phase and now as you see the increase in the pace of what we be do it become even more prominent where be all this person go to come from and a more general question for we society be what be go to happen to all the rest that be leave behind what about all the kid like I that be in school kid like some of you out there that be in school and do not get a chance and will never get a chance to participate in science and technology that be the question I ask and we talk about Ethiopia and it be very important Niger be equally important and I be try desperately to do something in Niger they have a AIDS problem I ask the U S State Department ask the government recently what do you want to do and they give they two problem dinosaur be one of they give we a museum of dinosaur and we will attract tourist which be we number two industry and I hope to God the United States government I or TED or somebody help we do that because that would be a incredible thing for they country but when we look back at we own country we be look back at we city the city where most of you come from certainly the city I come from there be legion of kid out there like this and the question be and we start to address this question for century as to how we get this kid involve in science we have start in Chicago a organization a non profit organization call Project Exploration this be two kid from Project Exploration we meet they in they early stage in high school they be fail to poor student and they be now one at the University of Chicago another in Illinois we have get student at Harvard we be six year old and we create a track record because when you go out there as a scholar and you try to find out longitudinal study track record like that there essentially be very few if none so we have create a incredible track record of 100 percent graduation 90 percent go to college many first generation 90 percent of that choose science as a career it be a impressive track record and so we look back and we say well we do not really exactly work this out theoretically from the start but when we look back there be theoretical movement in science education it be go through science as a inquiry which be a big advance and Dewey back at Chicago you learn by do to you learn by envision yourself as a scientist and then you learn to envision yourself as a scientist the next step be to learn the capability to make yourself a scientist you have to have that step if you have it be easy to get kid interested in science it be hard to get they to envision themselves as a scientist which involve stand up in front of person like we be do here at this symposium and present something as a knowledgeable person and then see yourself in the role as a scientist and give yourself the tool to pursue that and so that be what we be go to do we be plan a permanent home in Chicago we have lot of idea but I guarantee you this one thing and I have talk to some person here at TED it be not go to look like anything you have see before it be go to be part school part museum hall part conservatory part zoo and part of a answer to the problem of how you interest kid in science thank you very much
