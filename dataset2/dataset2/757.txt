this technology make a very important impact on we it change the way we history develop but it be a technology so pervasive so invisible that we for a long time forget to take it into account when we talk about human evolution but we see the result of this technology still so let make a little test so everyone of you turn to they neighbor please turn and face you neighbor please also on the balcony smile smile open the mouth smile friendly laughter do you do you see any canine tooth laughter count Dracula tooth in the mouth of you neighbor of course not because we dental anatomy be actually make not for tear down raw meat from bone or chew fibrous leaf for hour it be make for a diet which be soft mushy which be reduce in fiber which be very easily chewable and digestible sound like fast food do not it laughter it be for cook food we carry in we face the proof that cook food transformation make we what we be so I would suggest that we change how we classify ourselves we talk about ourselves as omnivore I would say we should call ourselves coctivor laughter from coquere to cook we be the animal who eat cook food no no no no well to live of cook food so cook be a very important technology it be technology I do not know how you feel but I like to cook for entertainment and you need some design to be successful so cook be a very important technology because it allow we to acquire what bring you all here the big brain this wonderful cerebral cortex we have because brain be expensive that have to pay tuition fee know laughter but it be also metabolically speak expensive you now we brain be two to three percent of the body mass but actually it use 25 percent of the total energy we use it be very expensive where do the energy come from of course from food if we eat raw food we can not release really the energy so this ingenuity of we ancestor to invent this most marvelous technology invisible everyone of we do it every day so to speak Cooking make it possible that mutation natural selection we environment could develop we so if we think about this unleash human potential which be possible by cook and food why do we talk so badly about food why be it always do and do n t and it be good for you it be not good for you I think the good news for I would be if we could go back and talk about the unleash the continuation of the unleash of human potential now cook allow also that we become a migrant species we walk out of Africa two time we populate all the ecology if you can cook nothing can happen to you because whatever you find you will try to transform it it keep also you brain work now the very easy and simple technology which be develop actually run after this formula take something which look like food transform it and it give you a good very easy accessible energy this technology affect two organ the brain and the gut which it actually affect the brain could grow but the gut actually shrink okay it be not obvious to be honest laughter but it shrink to 60 percent of primate gut of my body mass so because of have cook food it be easy to digest now have a large brain as you know be a big advantage because you can actually influence you environment you can influence you own technology you have invent you can continue to innovate and invent now the big brain do this also with cook but how do it actually run this show how do it actually interfere what kind of criterion do it use and this be actually taste reward and energy you know we have up to five taste three of they sustain we Sweet energy Umami this be a meaty taste you need proteins for muscle recovery salty because you need salt otherwise you electric body will not work and two taste which protect you bitter and sour which be against poisonous and rotten material but of course they be hard wired but we use they still in a sophisticated way think about bittersweet chocolate or think about the acidity of yogurt wonderful mixed with strawberry fruit so we can make mixture of all this kind of thing because we know that in cooking we can transform it to the form reward this be a more complex and especially integrative form of we brain with various different element the external state we internal state how do we feel and so on be put together and something which maybe you do not like but you be so hungry that you really will be satisfied to eat so satisfaction be a very important part and as I say energy be necessary now how do the gut actually participate in this development and the gut be a silent voice it be go more for feeling I use the euphemism digestive comfort actually it be a digestive discomfort which the gut be concern with if you get a stomach ache if you get a little bit bloated be not the right food be not the right cooking manipulation or maybe other thing go wrong so my story be a tale of two brain because it might surprise you we gut have a full fledged brain all the manager in the room say you do not tell I something new because we know gut feel this be what we be use laughter and actually you use it and it be actually useful because we gut be connect to we emotional limbic system they do speak with each other and make decision but what it mean to have a brain there be that not only the big brain have to talk with the food the food have to talk with the brain because we have to learn actually how to talk to the brain now if there be a gut brain we should also learn to talk with this brain now 150 year ago anatomist describe very very carefully here be a model of a wall of a gut I take the three element stomach small intestine and colon and within this structure you see this two pinkish layer which be actually the muscle and between this muscle they find nervous tissue a lot of nervous tissue which penetrate actually the muscle penetrate the submucosa where you have all the element for the immune system the gut be actually the large immune system defend you body it penetrate the mucosa this be the layer which actually touch the food you be swallow and you digest which be actually the lumen now if you think about the gut the gut be if you could stretch it 40 meter long the length of a tennis court if we could unroll it get out all the fold and so on it would have 400 sq meter of surface and now this brain take care over this to move it with the muscle and to do defend the surface and of course digest we food we cook so if we give you a specification this brain which be autonomous have 500 million nerve cell 100 million neuron so around the size of a cat brain so there sleep a little cat think for itself optimize whatever it digest it have 20 different neuron type it be get the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain where you have 100 billion neuron it have autonomous organized microcircuit have this program which run it sense the food it know exactly what to do it sense it by chemical means and very importantly by mechanical means because it have to move the food it have to mix all the various element which we need for digestion this control of muscle be very very important because you know there can be reflex if you do not like a food especially if you be a child you gag it be this brain which make this reflex and then finally it control also the secretion of this molecular machinery which actually digest the food we cook now how do the two brain work with each other I take here a model from robotic it be call the Subsumption Architecture what it mean be that we have a layered control system the low layer we gut brain have its own goal digestion defense and we have the high brain with the goal of integration and generate behavior now both look and this be the blue arrow both look to the same food which be in the lumen and in the area of you intestine the big brain integrate signal which come from the running program of the low brain but subsumption mean that the high brain can interfere with the low it can replace or it can inhibit actually signal so if we take two type of signal a hunger signal for example if you have a empty stomach you stomach produce a hormone call ghrelin it be a very big signal it be send to the brain say go and eat you have stop signal we have up to eight stop signal at least in my case they be not listen to laughter so what happen if the big brain in the integration override the signal so if you override the hunger signal you can have a disorder which be call anorexia despite generate a healthy hunger signal the big brain ignore it and activate different program in the gut the more usual case be overeat it actually take the signal and change it and we continue even though we eight signal would say stop enough we have transfer enough energy now the interesting thing be that along this low layer this gut the signal become strong and strong if undigested but digestible material could penetrate this we find from bariatric surgery that then the signal would be very very high so now back to the cooking question and back to the design we have learn to talk to the big brain taste and reward as you know now what would be the language we have to talk to the gut brain that its signal be so strong that the big brain can not ignore it then we would generate something all of we would like to have a balance between the hunger and the satiation now I give you from we research a very short claim this be fat digestion you have on you leave a olive oil droplet and this olive oil droplet get attack by enzyme this be a in vitro experiment it be very difficult to work in the intestine now everyone would expect that when the degradation of the oil happen when the constituent be liberated they disappear they go away because they be absorb actually what happen be that a very intricate structure appear and I hope you can see that there be some ring like structure in the middle image which be water this whole system generate a huge surface to allow more enzyme to attack the remain oil and finally on you right side you see a bubbly cell like structure appear from which the body will absorb the fat now if we could take this language and this be a language of structure and make it long last that it can go through the passage of the intestine it would generate strong signal so we research and I think the research also at the university be now fix on this point to say how can we actually and this might sound trivial now to you how can we change cook how can we cook that we have this language develop so what we have actually it be not a omnivore dilemma we have a coctivor opportunity because we have learn over the last two million year which taste and reward quite sophisticated to cook to please ourselves to satisfy ourselves if we add the matrix if we add the structure language which we have to learn when we learn it then we can put it back and around energy we could generate a balance which come out from we really primordial operation cooking so to make cooking really a very important element I would say even philosopher have to change and have to finally recognize that cooking be what make we so I would say coquo ergo sum I cook therefore I be thank you very much applause
