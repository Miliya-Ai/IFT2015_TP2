Jambo bonjour zdravstvujtye dayo this be a few of the language that I have speak little bit of over the course of the last six week as I have be to 17 country I think I be up to on this crazy tour I have be do check out various aspect of the project that we be do and I be go to tell you a little bit about later on and visit some pretty incredible place place like Mongolia Cambodia New Guinea South Africa Tanzania twice I be here a month ago and the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that be utterly amazing for lot of reason you see some incredible stuff and you get to make this spot comparison between person all around the globe and the thing that you really take away from that the kind of surface thing that you take away from it be not that we be all one although I be go to tell you about that but rather how different we be there be so much diversity around the globe 6 000 different language speak by six and a half billion person all different color shape size you walk down the street in any big city you travel like that and you be amazed at the diversity in the human species how do we explain that diversity well that be what I be go to talk about today be how we be use the tool of genetics population genetics in particular to tell we how we generate this diversity and how long it take now the problem of human diversity like all big scientific question how do you explain something like that can be break down into sub question and you can ferret away at that little sub question first one be really a question of origin do we all share a common origin in fact and give that we do and that be the assumption everybody I think in this room would make when be that when do we originate as a species how long have we be divergent from each other and the second question be relate but slightly different if we do spring from a common source how do we come to occupy every corner of the globe and in the process generate all of this diversity the different way of life the different appearance the different language around the world well the question of origin as with so many other question in biology seem to have be answer by Darwin over a century ago in the descent of Man he write in each great region of the world the living mammal be closely relate to the extinct species of the same region it be therefore probable that Africa be formerly inhabit by extinct ape closely ally to the gorilla and chimpanzee and as this two species be now man near ally it be somewhat more probable that we early progenitor live on the African continent than elsewhere so we be do we can go home finish the origin question well not quite because Darwin be talk about we distant ancestry we common ancestry with ape and it be quite clear that ape originate on the African continent around 23 million year ago they appear in the fossil record Africa be actually disconnect from the other landmass at that time due to the vagary of plate tectonic float around the Indian Ocean bump into Eurasia around 16 million year ago and then we have the first African exodus as we call it the ape that leave at that time end up in Southeast Asia become the gibbon and the orangutan and the one that stay on in Africa evolve into the gorilla the chimpanzee and we so yes if you be talk about we common ancestry with ape it be very clear by look at the fossil record we start off here but that be not really the question I be ask I be ask about we human ancestry thing that we would recognize as be like we if they be sit here in the room if they be peer over you shoulder you would not leap back like that what about we human ancestry because if we go far enough back we share a common ancestry with every living thing on Earth DNA tie we all together so we share ancestry with barracuda and bacterium and mushroom if you go far enough back over a billion year what we be ask about though be human ancestry how do we study that well historically it have be study use the science of paleoanthropology dig thing up out of the ground and largely on the basis of morphology the way thing be shape often skull shape say this look a little bit more like we than that so this must be my ancestor this must be who I be directly descend from the field of paleoanthropology I will argue give we lot of fascinating possibility about we ancestry but it do not give we the probability that we really want as scientist what do I mean by that you be look at a great example here this be three extinct species of hominid potential human ancestor all dig up just west of here in Olduvai Gorge by the Leakey family and they be all dating to roughly the same time from leave to right we have get Homo erectus Homo habilis and Australopithecus now call Paranthropus boisei the robust australopithecine three extinct species same place same time that mean that not all three could be my direct ancestor which one of this guy be I actually relate to possibility about we ancestry but not the probability that we be really look for well a different approach have be to look at morphology in human use the only datum that person really have at hand until quite recently again largely skull shape the first person to do this systematically be Linnaeus Carl von Linne a Swedish botanist who in the eighteenth century take it upon himself to categorize every living organism on the planet you think you have get a tough job and he do a pretty good job he categorize about 12 000 species in Systema Naturae he actually coin the term Homo sapiens it mean wise man in Latin but look around the world at the diversity of human he say well you know we seem to come in discreet sub species or category and he talk about African and American and Asian and European and a blatantly racist category he term Monstrosus which basically include all the person he do not like include imaginary folk like elf it be easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well intention but ultimately benighted musing of a eighteenth century scientist work in the pre darwinian era except if you have take physical anthropology as recently as 20 or 30 year ago in many case you would have learn basically that same classification of humanity human race that accord to physical anthropologist of 30 40 year ago Carlton Coon be the good example have be diverge from each other this be in the post darwinian era for over a million year since the time of Homo erectus but base on what datum very little very little morphology and a lot of guesswork well what I be go to talk about today what I be go to talk about now be a new approach to this problem instead of go out and guess about we ancestry dig thing up out of the ground possible ancestor and say it on the basis of morphology which we still do not completely understand we do not know the genetic cause underlie this morphological variation what we need to do be turn the problem on its head because what we be really ask be a genealogical problem or a genealogical question what we be try to do be construct a family tree for everybody alive today and as any genealogist will tell you anybody have a member of the family or maybe you have try to construct a family tree trace back in time you start in the present with relationship you be certain about you and you sibling you have a parent in common you and you cousin share a grandparent in common you gradually trace far and far back into the past add this ever more distant relationship but eventually no matter how good you be at dig up the church record and all that stuff you hit what the genealogist call a brick wall a point beyond which you do not know anything else about you ancestor and you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history that we have to feel we way through with whisper guidance who be this person who come before we have no write record well actually we do write in we dna in we genetic code we have a historical document that take we back in time to the very early day of we species and that be what we study now a quick primer on dna I suspect that not everybody in the audience be a geneticist it be a very long linear molecule a code version of how to make another copy of you it be you blueprint it be compose of four subunit a c g and t we call they and it be the sequence of that subunit that define that blueprint how long be it well it be billion of this subunit in length a haploid genome we actually have two copy of all of we chromosome a haploid genome be around 3 2 billion nucleotide in length and the whole thing if you add it all together be over six billion nucleotide long if you take all the dna out of one cell in you body and stretch it end to end it be around two meter long if you take all the dna out of every cell in you body and you stretch it end to end it would reach from here to the moon and back thousand of time it be a lot of information and so when you be copy this dna molecule to pass it on it be a pretty tough job imagine the long book you can think of War and Peace now multiply it by 100 and imagine copying that by hand and you be work away until late at night and you be very very careful and you be drink coffee and you be pay attention but occasionally when you be copy this by hand you be go to make a little typo a spelling mistake substitute a I for a e or a c for a t same thing happen to we dna as it be be pass on through the generation it do not happen very often we have a proofread mechanism build in but when it do happen and this change get transmit down through the generation they become marker of descent if you share a marker with someone it mean you share a ancestor at some point in the past the person who first have that change in they dna and it be by look at the pattern of genetic variation the pattern of this marker in person all over the world and assess the relative age when they occur throughout we history that we have be able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today this be two piece of dna that we use quite widely in we work mitochondrial dna trace a purely maternal line of descent you get you mtdna from you mother and you mother mother all the way back to the very first woman the y chromosome the piece of dna that make man man trace a purely paternal line of descent everybody in this room everybody in the world fall into a lineage somewhere on this tree now even though this be simplified version of the real tree they be still kind of complicate so let simplify they turn they on they side combine they so that they look like a tree with the root at the bottom and the branch go up what be the take home message well the thing that jump out at you first be that the deep lineage in we family tree be find within Africa among African that mean that African have be accumulate this mutational diversity for long and what that mean be that we originate in Africa it be write in we dna every piece of dna we look at have great diversity within Africa than outside of Africa and at some point in the past a sub group of African leave the African continent to go out and populate the rest of the world now how recently do we share this ancestry be it million of year ago which we might suspect by look at all this incredible variation around the world no the dna tell a story that be very clear within the last 200 000 year we all share a ancestor a single person mitochondrial Eve you might have hear about she in Africa a African woman who give rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today but what be even more amazing be that if you look at the y chromosome side the male side of the story the y chromosome Adam only live around 60 000 year ago that be only about 2 000 human generation the blink of a eye in a evolutionary sense that tell we we be all still live in Africa at that time this be a African man who give rise to all the y chromosome diversity around the world it be only within the last 60 000 year that we have start to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world such a amazing story we be all effectively part of a extended African family now that seem so recent why do not we start to leave early why do not Homo erectus evolve into separate species or sub species rather human race around the world why be it that we seem to have come out of Africa so recently well that be a big question this why question particularly in genetics and the study of history in general be always the big one the one that be tough to answer and so when all else fail talk about the weather what be go on to the world weather around 60 000 year ago well we be go into the bad part of the last ice age the last ice age start roughly 120 000 year ago it go up and down and it really start to accelerate around 70 000 year ago lot of evidence from sediment core and the pollen type oxygen isotope and so on we hit the last glacial maximum around 16 000 year ago but basically from 70 000 year on thing be get really tough get very cold the Northern Hemisphere have massive grow ice sheet New York City Chicago Seattle all under a sheet of ice most of Britain all of Scandinavia cover by ice several kilometer thick now Africa be the most tropical continent on the planet about 85 percent of it lie between Cancer and Capricorn and there be not a lot of glacier here except on the high mountain here in East Africa so what be go on here we be not cover in ice in Africa Rather Africa be dry out at that time this be a paleo climatological map of what Africa look like between 60 000 and 70 000 year ago reconstruct from all this piece of evidence that I mention before the reason for that be that ice actually suck moisture out of the atmosphere if you think about Antarctica it be technically a desert it get so little precipitation so the whole world be dry out the sea level be drop and Africa be turn to desert the Sahara be much big then than it be now and the human habitat be reduce to just a few small pocket compare to what we have today the evidence from genetic datum be that the human population around this time roughly 70 000 year ago crash to few than 2 000 individual we nearly go extinct we be hang on by we fingernail and then something happen a great illustration of it look at some stone tool the one on the left be from Africa from around a million year ago the one on the right be make by Neanderthals we distant cousin not we direct ancestor live in Europe and they date from around 50 000 or 60 000 year ago now at the risk of offend any paleoanthropologist or physical anthropologist in the audience basically there be not a lot of change between this two stone tool group the one on the left be pretty similar to the one on the right we be in a period of long cultural stasis from a million year ago until around 60 000 to 70 000 year ago the tool style do not change that much the evidence be that the human way of life do not change that much during that period but then 50 60 70 thousand year ago somewhere in that region all hell break loose art make its appearance the stone tool become much more finely craft the evidence be that human begin to specialize in particular prey species at particular time of the year the population size start to expand probably accord to what many linguist believe fully modern language syntactic language subject verb object that we use to convey complex idea like I be do now appear around that time we become much more social the social network expand this change in behavior allow we to survive this worsen condition in Africa and they allow we to start to expand around the world we have be talk at this conference about African success story well you want the ultimate African success story look in the mirror you be it the reason you be alive today be because of that change in we brain that take place in Africa probably somewhere in the region where we be sit right now around 60 70 thousand year ago allow we not only to survive in Africa but to expand out of Africa An early coastal migration along the south coast of Asia leave Africa around 60 000 year ago reach Australia very rapidly by 50 000 year ago a slightly later migration up into the Middle East this would have be savannah hunter so that of you who be go on one of the post conference tour you will get to see what a real savannah be like and it be basically a meat locker person who would have specialize in kill the animal hunt the animal on that meat locker savannah move up follow the grassland into the Middle East around 45 000 year ago during one of the rare wet phase in the Sahara migrate eastward follow the grassland because that be what they be adapt to live on and when they reach Central Asia they reach what be effectively a steppe super highway a grassland super highway the grassland at that time this be during the last ice age stretch basically from Germany all the way over to Korea and the entire continent be open to they enter Europe around 35 000 year ago and finally a small group migrate up through the bad weather imaginable Siberia inside the Arctic Circle during the last ice age temperature be at 70 80 even 100 perhaps migrate into the Americas ultimately reach that final frontier a amazing story and it happen first in Africa the change that allow we to do that the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with we allow we to create novel culture allow we to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I have just be on now that story I just tell you be literally a whirlwind tour of how we populate the world the great paleolithic wanderings of we species and that be the story that I tell a couple of year ago in my book the Journey of Man and a film that we make with the same title and as we be finish up that film it be co produce with National Geographic I start talk to the folk at NG about this work and they get really excited about it they like the film but they say you know we really see this as kind of the next wave in the study of human origin where we all come from use the tool of dna to map the migration around the world you know the study of human origin be kind of in we dna and we want to take it to the next level what do you want to do next which be a great question to be ask by National Geographic and I say well you know what I have sketch out here be just that it be a very coarse sketch of how we migrate around the planet and it be base on a few thousand person we have sample from you know a handful of population around the world study a few genetic marker and there be lot of gap on this map we have just connect the dot what we need to do be increase we sample size by a order of magnitude or more hundred of thousand of dna sample from person all over the world and that be the genesis of the Genographic Project the project launch in April 2005 it have three core component obviously science be a big part of it the field research that we be do around the world with indigenous people person who have live in the same location for a long period of time retain a connection to the place where they live that many of the rest of we have lose so my ancestor come from all over northern Europe I live in the Eastern Seaboard of North America when I be not travel where be I indigenous to nowhere really my gene be all jumble up but there be person who retain that link to they ancestor that allow we to contextualize the dna result that be the focus of the field research the center that we have set up all over the world 10 of they top population geneticist but in addition we want to open up this study to anybody around the world how often do you get to participate in a big scientific project the Human Genome Project or a Mars Rover mission in this case you actually can you can go onto we website nationalgeographic com genographic you can order a kit you can test you own dna and you can actually submit that result to the database and tell we a little about you genealogical background have the datum analyze as part of the scientific effort now this be all a nonprofit enterprise and so the money that we raise after we cover the cost of do the testing and make the kit component get plow back into the project the majority go to something we call the Legacy Fund it be a charitable entity basically a grant give entity that give money back to indigenous group around the world for educational cultural project initiate by they they apply to this fund in order to do various project and I will show you a couple of example so how be we do on the project we have get about 25 000 sample collect from indigenous person around the world the most amazing thing have be the interest on the part of the public 210 000 person have order this participation kit since we launch two year ago which have raise around five million dollar the majority of which at least half be go back into the Legacy Fund we have just award the first legacy grant total around 500 000 dollar Projects around the world document oral poetry in Sierra Leone preserve traditional weaving pattern in Gaza language revitalization in Tajikistan etc etc so the project be go very very well and I urge you to check out the website and watch this space thank you very much applause
