in the spirit of Jacques Cousteau who say person protect what they love I want to share with you today what I love most in the ocean and that be the incredible number and variety of animal in it that make light my addiction begin with this strange look diving suit call Wasp that be not a acronym just somebody think it look like the insect it be actually develop for use by the offshore oil industry for diving on oil rig down to a depth of 2 000 foot right after I complete my ph d I be lucky enough to be include with a group of scientist that be use it for the first time as a tool for ocean exploration we train in a tank in Port Hueneme and then my first open ocean dive be in Santa Barbara Channel it be a evening dive I go down to a depth of 880 foot and turn out the light and the reason I turn out the light be because I know I would see this phenomenon of animal make light call bioluminescence but I be totally unprepared for how much there be and how spectacular it be I see chain of jellyfish call siphonophore that be long than this room pump out so much light that I could read the dial and gauge inside the suit without a flashlight and puff and billow of what look like luminous blue smoke and explosion of spark that would swirl up out of the thruster just like when you throw a log on a campfire and the ember swirl up off the campfire but this be icy blue ember it be breathtaking now usually if person be familiar with bioluminescence at all it be this guy it be firefly and there be a few other land dweller that can make light some insect earthworm fungus but in general on land it be really rare in the ocean it be the rule rather than the exception if I go out in the open ocean environment virtually anywhere in the world and I drag a net from 3 000 foot to the surface most of the animal in fact in many place 80 to 90 percent of the animal that I bring up in that net make light this make for some pretty spectacular light show now I want to share with you a little video that I shoot from a submersible I first develop this technique work from a little single person submersible call Deep Rover and then adapt it for use on the Johnson Sea Link which you see here so mount in front of the observation sphere there be a a three foot diameter hoop with a screen stretch across it and inside the sphere with I be a intensify camera that be about as sensitive as a fully dark adapt human eye albeit a little fuzzy so you turn on the camera turn out the light that sparkle you be see be not luminescence that be just electronic noise on this super intensify camera you do not see luminescence until the submersible begin to move forward through the water but as it do animal bump into the screen be stimulate to bioluminesce now when I be first do this all I be try to do be count the number of source I know my forward speed I know the area and so I could figure out how many hundred of source there be per cubic meter but I start to realize that I could actually identify animal by the type of flash they produce and so here in the Gulf of Maine at 740 foot I can name pretty much everything you be see there to the species level like that big explosion spark be from a little comb jelly and there krill and other kind of crustacean and jellyfish there be another one of that comb jelly and so I have work with computer image analysis engineer to develop automatic recognition system that can identify this animal and then extract the XYZ coordinate of the initial impact point and we can then do the kind of thing that ecologist do on land and do near neighbor distance but you do not always have to go down to the depths of the ocean to see a light show like this you can actually see it in surface water this be some shoot by Dr Mike Latz at Scripps Institution of a dolphin swimming through bioluminescent plankton and this be not someplace exotic like one of the bioluminescent bay in Puerto Rico this be actually shoot in San Diego Harbor and sometimes you can see it even close than that because the head on ship that toilet for any land lover that be listen be flush with unfiltered seawater that often have bioluminescent plankton in it so if you stagger into the head late at night and you be so toilet hugging sick that you forget to turn on the light you may think that you be have a religious experience laughter so how do a live creature make light well that be the question that 19th century French physiologist Raphael Dubois ask about this bioluminescent clam he grind it up and he manage to get out a couple of chemical one the enzyme he call luciferase the substrate he call luciferin after Lucifer the Lightbearer that terminology have stick but it do not actually refer to specific chemical because this chemical come in a lot of different shape and form in fact most of the person study bioluminescence today be focus on the chemistry because this chemical have prove so incredibly valuable for develop antibacterial agent cancer fight drug test for the presence of life on Mars detect pollutant in we water which be how we use it at orca in 2008 the Nobel Prize in Chemistry be award for work do on a molecule call green fluorescent protein that be isolate from the bioluminescent chemistry of a jellyfish and it be be equate to the invention of the microscope in term of the impact that it have have on cell biology and genetic engineering another thing all this molecule be tell we that apparently bioluminescence have evolve at least 40 time maybe as many as 50 separate time in evolutionary history which be a clear indication of how spectacularly important this trait be for survival so what be it about bioluminescence that be so important to so many animal well for animal that be try to avoid predator by stay in the darkness light can still be very useful for the three basic thing that animal have to do to survive and that be find food attract a mate and avoid be eat so for example this fish have a build in headlight behind its eye that it can use for find food or attract a mate and then when it be not use it it actually can roll it down into its head just like the headlight on you Lamborghini this fish actually have high beam and this fish which be one of my favorite have three headlight on each side of its head now this one be blue and that be the color of most bioluminescence in the ocean because evolution have select for the color that travel farth through seawater in order to optimize communication so most animal make blue light and most animal can only see blue light but this fish be a really fascinating exception because it have two red light organ and I have no idea why there be two and that be something I want to solve some day but not only can it see blue light but it can see red light so it use its red bioluminescence like a sniper scope to be able to sneak up on animal that be blind to red light and be able to see they without be see it be also get a little chin barbel here with a blue luminescent lure on it that it can use to attract prey from a long way off and a lot of animal will use they bioluminescence as a lure this be another one of my favorite fish this be a viperfish and it be get a lure on the end of a long fishing rod that it arch in front of the toothy jaw that give the viperfish its name the tooth on this fish be so long that if they close inside the mouth of the fish it would actually impale its own brain so instead it slide in groove on the outside of the head this be a Christmas tree of a fish everything on this fish light up it be not just that lure it be get a build in flashlight it be get this jewel like light organ on its belly that it use for a type of camouflage that obliterate its shadow so when it be swim around and there be a predator look up from below it make itself disappear it be get light organ in the mouth it be get light organ in every single scale in the fin in a mucus layer on the back and the belly all use for different thing some of which we know about some of which we do not and we know a little bit more about bioluminescence thanks to Pixar and I be very grateful to Pixar for share my favorite topic with so many person I do wish with they budget that they might have spend just a tiny bit more money to pay a consulting fee to some poor starve graduate student who could have tell they that that be the eye of a fish that be be preserve in formalin this be the eye of a live anglerfish so she be get a lure that she stick out in front of this live mousetrap of needle sharp tooth in order to attract in some unsuspecting prey and this one have a lure with all kind of little interesting thread come off it now we use to think that the different shape of the lure be to attract different type of prey but then stomach content analysis on this fish do by scientist or more likely they graduate student have reveal that they all eat pretty much the same thing so now we believe that the different shape of the lure be how the male recognize the female in the anglerfish world because many of this male be what be know as dwarf male this little guy have no visible means of self support he have no lure for attract food and no tooth for eat it when it get there he only hope for existence on this planet be as a gigolo laughter he be get to find himself a babe and then he be get to latch on for life so this little guy have find himself this babe and you will note that he be have the good sense to attach himself in a way that he do not actually have to look at she laughter but he still know a good thing when he see it and so he seal the relationship with a eternal kiss he flesh fuse with she flesh she bloodstream grow into he body and he become nothing more than a little sperm sac laughter well this be a deep sea version of woman lib she always know where he be and she do not have to be monogamous because some of this female come up with multiple male attach so they can use it for find food for attract mate they use it a lot for defense many different way a lot of they can release they luciferin or luferase in the water just the way a squid or a octopus will release a ink cloud this shrimp be actually spew light out of its mouth like a fire breathing dragon in order to blind or distract this viperfish so that the shrimp can swim away into the darkness and there be a lot of different animal that can do this there be jellyfish there squid there be a whole lot of different crustacean there be even fish that can do this this fish be call the shine tubeshoulder because it actually have a tube on its shoulder that can squirt out light and I be luck enough to capture one of this when we be on a trawling expedition off the northwest coast of Africa for Blue Planet for the deep portion of Blue Planet and we be use a special trawling net that we be able to bring this animal up alive so we capture one of this and I bring it into the lab so I be hold it and I be about to touch that tube on its shoulder and when I do you will see bioluminescence come out but to I what be shocking be not just the amount of light but the fact that it be not just luciferin and luciferase for this fish it be actually whole cell with nucleus and membrane it be energetically very costly for this fish to do this and we have no idea why it do it another one of this great mystery that need to be solve now another form of defense be something call a burglar alarm same reason you have a burglar alarm on you car the honking horn and flash light be mean to attract the attention of hopefully the police that will come and take the burglar away when a animal catch in the clutch of a predator its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of something big and nasty that will attack they attacker thereby afford they a chance for escape this jellyfish for example have a spectacular bioluminescent display this be we chase it in the submersible that be not luminescence that be reflect light from the gonad we capture it in a very special device on the front of the submersible that allow we to bring it up in really pristine condition bring it into the lab on the ship and then to generate the display you be about to see all I do be touch it once per second on its nerve ring with a sharp pick that be sort of like the sharp tooth of a fish and once this display get go I be not touch it anymore this be a unbelievable light show it be this pinwheel of light and I have do calculation that show that this could be see from as much as 300 foot away by a predator and I think you know that might actually make a pretty good lure because one of the thing that be frustrate I as a deep sea explorer be how many animal there probably be in the ocean that we know nothing about because of the way we explore the ocean the primary way that we know about what live in the ocean be we go out and drag net behind ship and I defy you to name any other branch of science that still depend on hundred of year old technology the other primary way be we go down with submersible and remote operate vehicle I have make hundred of dive in submersible when I be sit in a submersible though I know that I be not unobtrusive at all I have get bright light and noisy thruster any animal with any sense be go to be long go so I have want for a long time to figure out a different way to explore and so sometime ago I get this idea for a camera system it be not exactly rocket science we call this thing Eye in the Sea and scientist have do this on land for year we just use a color that the animal can not see and then a camera that can see that color you can not use infrared in the sea we use far red light but even that be a problem because it get absorb so quickly make a intensify camera want to make this electronic jellyfish thing be in science you basically have to tell the funding agency what you be go to discover before they will give you the money and I do not know what I be go to discover so I could not get the funding for this so I kluge this together I get the Harvey Mudd Engineering Clinic to actually do it as a undergraduate student project initially and then I kluge fund from a whole bunch of different source Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute give I time with they rov so that I could test it and we could figure out you know for example which color of red light we have to use so that we could see the animal but they could not see we get the electronic jellyfish work and you can see just what a shoestring operation this really be because we cast this 16 blue lead in epoxy and you can see in the epoxy mold that we use the word ziploc be still visible needless to say when it be kluge together like this there be a lot of trial and tribulation get this work but there come a moment when it all come together and everything work and remarkably that moment get catch on film by photographer Mark Richards who happen to be there at the precise moment that we discover that it all come together that be I on the leave my graduate student at the time Erika Raymond and Lee Fry who be the engineer on the project and we have this photograph post in we lab in a place of honor with the caption engineer satisfy two woman at once laughter and we be very very happy so now we have a system that we could actually take to some place that be kind of like a oasis on the bottom of the ocean that might be patrol by large predator and so the place that we take it to be this place call a Brine Pool which be in the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico it be a magical place and I know this footage be not go to look like anything to you we have a crummy camera at the time but I be ecstatic we be at the edge of the Brine Pool there be a fish that be swim towards the camera it be clearly undisturbed by we and I have my window into the deep sea I for the first time could see what animal be do down there when we be not down there disturb they in some way four hour into the deployment we have program the electronic jellyfish to come on for the first time eighty six second after it go into its pinwheel display we record this this be a squid over six foot long that be so new to science it can not be place in any known scientific family I could not have ask for a good proof of concept and base on this I go back to the National Science Foundation and say this be what we will discover and they give I enough money to do it right which have involve develop the world first deep sea webcam which have be install in the Monterey Canyon for the past year and now more recently a modular form of this system a much more mobile form that be a lot easy to launch and recover that I hope can be use on Sylvia hope spot to help explore and protect this area and for I learn more about the bioluminescence in this hope spot so one of this take home message here be there be still a lot to explore in the ocean and Sylvia have say that we be destroy the ocean before we even know what be in they and she be right so if you ever ever get a opportunity to take a dive in a submersible say yes a thousand time yes and please turn out the light I promise you will love it thank you applause
