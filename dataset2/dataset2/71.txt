about 15 year ago I go to visit a friend in Hong Kong and at the time I be very superstitious so upon land this be still at the old Hong Kong airport that be Kai Tak when it be smack in the middle of the city I think if I see something good I be go to have a great time here in my two week and if I see something negative I be go to be miserable indeed so the plane land in between the building and get to a full stop in front of this little billboard laughter and I actually go to see some of the design company in Hong Kong in my stay there and it turn out that I just go to see you know what they be do in Hong Kong but I actually walk away with a great job offer and I fly back to Austria pack my bag and another week later I be again on my way to Hong Kong still superstition and think well if that winner billboard be still up I be go to have a good time work here laughter but if it be go it be go to be really miserable and stressful so it turn out that not only be the billboard still up but they have put this one right next to it laughter on the other hand it also teach I where superstition get I because I really have a terrible time in Hong Kong laughter however I do have a number of real moment of happiness in my life of you know I think what the conference brochure refer to as moment that take you breath away and since I be a big list maker I actually list they all laughter now you do not have to go through the trouble of read they and I will not read they for you I know that it be incredibly boring to hear about other person happiness laughter what I do do though be I actually look at they from a design standpoint and just eliminate all the one that have nothing to do with design and very surprisingly over half of they have actually something to do with design so there be of course two different possibility there be one from a consumer point of view where I be happy while experience design and I will just give you one example I have get my first Walkman this be 1983 my brother have this great Yamaha motorcycle that he be willing to borrow to I freely and the Police synchronicity cassette have just be release and there be no helmet law in my hometown of Bregenz so you could drive up into the mountain freely blast the police on the new Sony Walkman laughter and I remember it as a true moment of happiness you know of course they be relate to this combination of at least two of they be you know design object and you know there be a scale of happiness when you talk about in design but the motorcycle incident would definitely be you know situate somewhere here right in there between Delight and Bliss now there be the other part from a designer standpoint if you be happy while actually do it and one way to see how happy designer be when they be design could be to look at the author photo on the back of they monograph laughter so accord to this the Australian and the Japanese as well as the Mexican be very happy laughter while somewhat the Spaniards and I think particularly the Swiss laughter do not seem to be do all that well laughter last November a museum open in Tokyo call the Mori Museum in a skyscraper up on the 56th floor and they inaugural exhibit be call Happiness and I go very eagerly to see it because well also with a eye on this conference and they interestingly section the exhibit off into four different area under Arcadia they show thing like this from the Edo period a hundred way to write happiness in different form or they have this apple by Yoko Ono that of course later on be you know make into the label for the Beatles under Nirvana they show this Constable painting and there be a little a interesting theory about abstraction this be a blue field it be actually a Yves Klein painting and the theory be that if you abstract a image you really you know open as much room for the un representable and therefore you know be able to involve the viewer more then under Desire they show this shunsho painting also from the Edo period ink on silk and lastly under Harmony they have this 13th century mandala from Tibet now what I take away from the exhibit be that maybe with the exception of the mandala most of the piece in there be actually about the visualization of happiness and not about happiness and I feel a little bit cheated because the visualization that be a really easy thing to do and you know my studio we have do it all the time this be you know a book a happy dog and you take it out it be a aggressive dog it be a happy David Byrne and a angry David Byrne or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face you know that be not a big deal to accomplish it have get to the point where you know within advertising or within the movie industry happy have get such a bad reputation that if you actually want to do something with the subject and still appear authentic you almost would have to you know do it from a cynical point of view this be you know the movie poster or we a couple of week ago design a box set for the talk head where the happiness visualize on the cover definitely have very much a dark side to it much much more difficult be this where the design actually can evoke happiness and I be go to just show you three that actually do this for I this be a campaign do by a young artist in New York who call himself true everybody who have ride the New York subway system will be familiar with this sign true print he own version of this sign Met every Wednesday at a subway stop with 20 of he friend they divide up the different subway line and add they own version laughter so this be one laughter now the way this work in the system be that nobody ever look at this sign so you be laughter you be really bored in the subway and you kind of stare at something and it take you a while until it actually you realize that this say something different than what it normally say laughter I mean that be at least how it make I happy laughter now true be a real humanitarian he do not want any of he friend to be arrest so he supply everybody with this fake volunteer card laughter and also give this fake letter from the mta to everybody sort of like pretend that it be a art project finance by the Metropolitan Transit Authority laughter another New York project this be at p s 1 a sculpture that be basically a square room by James Turrell that have a retractable ceiling open up at dusk and dawn every day you do not see the horizon you be just in there watch the incredible subtle change of color in the sky and the room be truly something to be see People demeanor change when they go in there and for sure I have not look at the sky in the same way after spend a hour in there there be of course more than that three project that I be show here I would definitely say that observe Vik Muniz cloud a couple of year ago in Manhattan for sure make I happy as well but my last project be again from a young designer in New York he be from Korea originally and he take it upon himself to print 55 000 speech bubble empty speech bubble sticker large one and small one and he go around New York and just put they empty as they be on poster laughter and other person go and fill they in laughter this one say please let I die in peace laughter I think that be the most surprising to myself be that the writing be actually so good this be on a musician poster that say I be concerned that my cd will not sell more than 200 000 unit and that as a result my recoupable advance from my label will be take from I after which my contract will be cancel and I will be back do journey cover on Bleecker Street laughter I think the reason this work so well be because everybody involve win Jee get to have he project the public get a sweet environment and different public get a place to express itself and the advertiser finally get somebody to look at they ad laughter well there be a question of course that be on my mind for a while you know can I do more of the thing that I like do in design and less of the one that I do not like to be do which bring I back to my list make you know just to see what I actually like about my job you know one be just work without pressure then work concentrate without be frazzle or as Nancy say before like really immerse oneself into it try not to get stuck do the same thing or try not get stick behind the computer all day this be you know relate to it get out of the studio then of course try to you know work on thing where the content be actually important for I and be able to enjoy the end result and then I find another list in one of my diary that actually contain all the thing that I think I learn in my life so far and just about at that time a Austrian magazine call and ask if we would want to do six spread design six spread that work like divide page between the different chapter in the magazine and the whole thing just fall together so I just pick one of the thing that I think I learn in this case everything I do always come back to I and we make this spread right out of this so it be everything I do always come back to I a couple of week ago a laughter French company ask we to design five billboard for they again we could supply the content for it so I just pick another one and this be two week ago we fly to Arizona the designer who work with I and myself and photograph this one so it be try to look good limit my life and then we do one more of this this be again for a magazine divide page this be have this be the same thing it be just you know photograph from the side this be from the front then it be gut again it be the same thing gut be just the same room rework then it be always work out then it be for with the light on laughter and it be I thank you so much applause
