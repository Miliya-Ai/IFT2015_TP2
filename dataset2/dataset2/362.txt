I be go to talk about a very fundamental change that be go on in the very fabric of the modern economy and to talk about that I be go to go back to the beginning because in the beginning be commodity commodity be thing that you grow in the ground raise on the ground or pull out of the ground basically animal mineral vegetable and then you extract they out of the ground and sell they on the open marketplace commodity be the basis of the agrarian economy that last for millennia but then along come the industrial revolution and then goods become the predominant economic offering where we use commodity as a raw material to be able to make or manufacture goods so we move from a agrarian economy to a industrial economy well what then happen over the last 50 or 60 year be that goods have become commoditized commoditize where they be treat like a commodity where person do not care who make they they just care about three thing and three thing only price price and price now there be a antidote to commoditization and that be customization my first book be call Mass Customization it come up a couple of time yesterday and how I discover this progression of economic value be realize that customize a good automatically turn it into a service because it be do just for a particular person because it be not inventory it be deliver on demand to that individual person so we move from a industrial economy to a service base economy but over the past 10 or 20 year what be happen be that service be be commoditize as well long distance telephone service sell on price price price fast food restaurant with all they value pricing and even the internet be commoditize not just goods but service as well what that mean be that it be time to move to a new level of economic value time to go beyond the goods and the service and use in that same heuristic what happen when you customize a service what happen when you design a service that be so appropriate for a particular person that be exactly what they need at this moment in time then you can not help but make they go wow you can not help but turn it into a memorable event you can not help but turn it into a experience so we be shift to a experience economy where experience be become the predominant economic offering now most place that I talk to when I talk about experience I talk about Disney the world premier experience stager I talk about theme restaurant and experiential retail and boutique hotel and Las Vegas the experience capital of the world but here when you think about experience think about Thomas Dolby and he group play music think about meaningful place think about drink wine about a journey to the clock of the long now that be all experience think about TED itself the experience capital in the world of conference all of this be experience now over the last several year I spend a lot of time in Europe and particularly in the Netherlands and whenever I talk about the experience economy there I be always greet at the end with one particular question almost invariably and the question be not really so much a question as a accusation and the dutch when they usually put it it always start with the same two word you know the word I mean you American they say you American you like you fantasy environment you fake you Disneyland experience they say we Dutch we like real natural authentic experience so much have that happen that I have develop a fairly praticed response which be I point out that first of all you have to understand that there be no such thing as a inauthentic experience why because the experience happen inside of we it be we reaction to the event that be stage in front of we so as long as we be in any sense authentic human be then every experience we have be authentic now there may be more or less natural or artificial stimulus for the experience but even that be a matter of degree not kind and there be no such thing as a 100 percent natural experience even if you go for a walk in the proverbial wood there be a company that manufacture the car that deliver you to the edge of the wood there be a company that manufacture the shoe that you have to protect yourself from the ground of the wood there be a company that provide a cell phone service you have in case you get lose in the wood right all of that be man make artificiality bring into the wood by you and by the very nature of be there and then I always finish off by talk about the thing that amaze I the most about this question particularly come from the Dutch be that the Netherlands be every bit as manufacture as Disneyland laughter and the Dutch they always go and they realize I be right there be not a square meter of ground in the entire country that have not be reclaim from the sea or otherwise move modify and manicure to look as if it have always be there it be the only place you ever go for a walk in the wood and all the tree be line up in row laughter but nonetheless not just the dutch but everyone have this desire for the authentic and authenticity be therefore become the new consumer sensibility the buying criterion by which consumer be choose who be they go to buy from and what they be go to buy become the basis of the economy in fact you can look at how each of this economy develop that each one have they own business imperative match with a consumer sensibility we be the agrarian economy and we be supply commodity it be about supply and availability get the commodity to market with the industrial economy it be about control cost get the cost down as low as possible so we can offer they to the mass with the service economy it be about improve quality that have the whole quality movement have rise with the service economy over the past 20 or 30 year and now with the experience economy it be about render authenticity render authenticity and the keyword be render right rendering because you have to get you consumer as business person to percieve you offer as authentic because there be a basic paradox no one can have a inauthentic experience but no business can supply one because all business be man make object all business be involve with money all business be a matter of use machinery and all that thing make something inauthentic so how do you render authenticity be the question be you render authenticity when you think about that let I go back to what Lionel Trilling in he seminal book on authenticity sincerity and authenticity come out in 1960 point to as the seminal point at which authenticity enter the lexicon if you will and that be to no surprise in Shakespeare and in he play Hamlet and there be one part in this play Hamlet where the most fake of all the character in Hamlet Polonius say something profoundly real at the end of a laundry list of advice he be give to he son Laertes he say this and this above all to thine own self be true and it doth follow as night the day that thou canst not then be false to any man and that three verse be the core of authenticity there be two dimension to authenticity one be true to yourself which be very self direct two be other direct be what you say you be to other and I do not know about you but whenever I encounter two dimension I immediately go ahh two by two all right anybody else like that no well if you think about that you do in fact get a two by two where on one dimension it be a matter of be true to yourself as business be the economic offering you be provide be they true to themselves and the other dimension be be they what they say they be to other if not you have be not true to itself and be not what it say it be yield a two by two matrix and of course if you be both true to yourself and be what you say you be then you be real real laughter the opposite of course be fake fake all right now there be value for fake there will always be company around to supply the fake because there will always be desire for the fake fact be there be a general rule if you do not like it it be fake if you do like it it be faux laughter now the other two side of the coin be be a real fake be what it say it be but be not true to itself or be a fake real be true to itself but not what it say it be you can think about that two you know both of this good than be fake fake not quite as good as be real real you can contrast they by think about Universal City Walk versus Disney World or Disneyland Universal City Walk be a real fake in fact we get this very term from Ada Louise Huxtable book the Unreal America a wonderful book where she talk about Universal City Walk as you know she decry the fake but she say at least that be a real fake right because you can see behind the facade right it be what it say it be it be Universal Studio it be in the city of Los Angeles you be go to walk a lot right you do not tend to walk a lot in Los Angeles well here be a place where you be go to walk a lot outside in this city but be it really true to itself right be it really in the city be it you can see behind all of it and see what be go on in the facade of it so she call it a real fake Disney World on the other hand be a fake real or a fake reality right it be not what it say it be it be not really the magic kingdom laughter but it be oh I be sorry I do not mean to laughter sorry we will not talk about Santa Claus then laughter but Disney World be wonderfully true to itself right just wonderfully true to itself when you be there you be just immerse in this wonderful environment so it be a fake real now the easy way to fall down in this and not be real real right the easy way not to be true to yourself be not to understand you heritage and thereby repudiate that heritage right the key of be true to yourself be know who you be as a business know where you heritage be what you have do in the past and what you have do in the past limit what you can do what you can get away with essentially in the future so you have to understand that past think about Disney again Disney 10 or 15 year ago right the Disney the company that be probably good know for family value out there Disney buy the ABC network the ABC network affectionately know in the trade as the t a network right that be not too much jargon be it right the t a network then it buy Miramax know for its nc 17 fare and all of a sudden family everywhere could not really trust what they be get from Disney it be no long true to its heritage no longer true to Walt Disney that be one of the reason why they be have such trouble today and why Roy Disney be out to get Michael Eisner because it be no long true to itself so understand what you past limit what you can do in the future when it come to be what you say you be the easy mistake that company make be that they advertise thing that they be not that be when you be perceive as fake as a phony company advertizing thing that you be not think about any hotel any airline any hospital right if you could check into the ad you would have a great experience laughter but unfortunately you have to experience the actual hotel airline and hospital and then you have that disconnect then you have that perception that you be phony so the number one thing to do when it come to be what you say you be be to provide place for person to experience who you be for person to experience who you be right it be not advertise do it that be why you have company like Starbucks right that do not advertise at all they say you want to know who we be you have to come experience we and think about the economic value they have provide by that experience right coffee at its core be what right it be bean right it be coffee bean you know how much coffee be worth when treat as a commodity as a bean two or three cent per cup that be what coffee be worth but grind it roast it package it put it on a grocery store shelf and now it will cost five 10 15 cent when you treat it as a good take that same good and perform the service of actually brew it for a customer in a corner diner in a bodega a kiosk somewhere you get 50 cent maybe a buck per cup of coffee but surround the brewing of that coffee with the ambiance of a Starbucks with the authentic cedar that go inside of there and now because of that authentic experience you can charge two three four five dollar for a cup of coffee so authenticity be become the new consumer sensibility let I summarize it for the business person in the audience with three rule three basic rule one do not say you be authentic unless you really be authentic two it be easy to be authentic if you do not say you be authentic and three if you say you be authentic you well be authentic and then for the consumer for everyone else in the audience let I simply summarize it by say increasingly what we what will make we happy be spend we time and we money satisfy the desire for authenticity thank you
