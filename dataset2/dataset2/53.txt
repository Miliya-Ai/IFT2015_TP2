a fact come out of MIT couple of year ago Ken Hale who be a linguist say that of the 6 000 language speak on Earth right now 3 000 be not speak by the child so that in one generation we be go to halve we cultural diversity he go on to say that every two week a eld go to the grave carry the last spoken word of that culture so a entire philosophy a body of knowledge about the natural world that have be empirically glean over century go away and this happen every two week so for the last 20 year since my dental experience I have be travel the world and come back with story about some of this person what I would like to do right now be share some of that story with you this be Tamdin she be a 69 year old nun she be throw in prison in Tibet for two year for put up a little tiny placard protest the occupation of she country and when I meet she she have just take a walk over the Himalayas from Lhasa the capital of Tibet into Nepal across to India 30 day to meet she leader the Dalai Lama the Dalai Lama live in Dharamsala India so I take this picture three day after she arrive and she have this beat up pair of tennis shoe on with she toe stick out and she cross in March and there be a lot of snow at 18 500 foot in March this be Paldin Paldin be a 62 year old monk and he spend 33 year in prison he whole monastery be throw into prison at the time of the uprising when the Dalai Lama have to leave Tibet and he be beat starve torture lose all he tooth while in prison and when I meet he he be a kind gentle old man and it really impress I I meet he two week after he get out of prison that he go through that experience and end up with the demeanor that he have so I be in Dharamsala meet this person and I would spend about five week there and I be hear this similar story of this refugee that have pour out of Tibet into Dharamsala and it just so happen on the fifth week there be a public teaching by the Dalai Lama and I be watch this crowd of monk and nun many of which I have just interview and hear they story and I watch they face and they give we a little FM radio and we could listen to the translation of he teach and what he say be treat you enemy as if they be precious jewel because it be you enemy that build you tolerance and patience on the road to you enlightenment that hit I so hard tell this person that have be through this experience so two month later I go into Tibet and I start interview the person there take my photograph that be what I do I interview and do portrait and this be a little girl I take she portrait up on top of the Jokhang Temple and I would snuck in because it be totally illegal to have a picture of the Dalai Lama in Tibet it be the quick way you can get arrest so I snuck in a bunch of little wallet sized picture of the Dalai Lama and I would hand they out and when I give they to the person they would either hold they to they heart or they would hold they up to they head and just stay there and this be well at the time I do this 10 year ago that be 36 year after the Dalai Lama have leave so I be go in interview this person and do they portrait this be Jigme and she sister Sonam and they live up on the Chang Tang the Tibetan Plateau way in the western part of the country this be at 17 000 foot and they have just come down from the high pasture at 18 000 foot same thing give she a picture she hold it up to she forehead and I usually hand out polaroid when I do this because I be set up light and check my light and when I show she she Polaroid she scream and run into she tent this be Tenzin Gyatso he be find to be the Buddha of Compassion at the age of two out in a peasant house way out in the middle of nowhere at the age of four he be install as the 14th Dalai Lama as a teenager he face the invasion of he country and have to deal with it he be the leader of the country eight year later when they discover there be a plot to kill he they dress he up like a beggar and snuck he out of the country on horseback and take the same trip that Tamdin do and he be never be back to he country since and if you think about this man 46 year late still stick to this non violent response to a severe political and human right issue and the young person young Tibetan be start to say listen this do not work you know violence as a political tool be all the rage right now and he still be hold this line so this be we icon to non violence in we world one of we live icon this be another leader of he person this be Moi this be in the Ecuadorian Amazon and Moi be 35 year old and this area of the Ecuadorian Amazon oil be discover in 1972 and in this period of time since that time as much oil or twice as much oil as be spill in the Exxon Valdez accident be spill in this little area of the Amazon and the tribe in this area have constantly have to move and Moi belong to the Huaorani tribe and they be know as very fierce they be know as auca and they have manage to keep out the seismologist and the oil worker with spear and blowgun and we spend I be with a team two week with this guy out in the jungle watch they hunt this be on a monkey hunt hunting with curare tip darts and the knowledge that this person have about the natural environment be incredible they could hear thing smell thing see thing I could not see and I could not even see the monkey that they be get with this darts this be Yadira and Yadira be five year old she be in a tribe that be neighbor the Huaorani and she tribe have have to move three time in the last 10 year because of the oil spill and we never hear about that and the late infraction against this person be as part of Plan Colombia we be spray paraquat or round up whatever it be we be defoliate thousand of acre of the Ecuadorian Amazon in we war on drug and this person be the person who take the brunt of it this be Mengatoue he be the shaman of the Huaorani and he say to we you know I be a old man now I be get tired you know I be tired of spear this oil worker I wish they would just go away and I be I usually travel alone when I do my work but I do this I host a program for Discovery and when I go down with the team I be quite concerned about go in with a whole bunch of person especially into the Huaorani deep into the Huaorani tribe and as it turn out this guy really teach I a thing or two about blend in with the local laughter one of the thing I do just before 9 11 August of 2001 I take my son Dax who be 16 at the time and I take he to Pakistan because at first I want you know I have take he on a couple of trip but I want he to see person that live on a dollar a day or less I want he to get a experience in the Islamic world and I also want he to I be go there to work with a group do a story on a group call the Kalash that be a group of animist 3 000 animist that live very small area surround by Islam there be 3 000 of this Kalash leave they be incredible person so it be a great experience for he he stay up all night with they drum and dance and he bring a soccer ball and we have soccer every night in this little village and then we go up and meet they shaman by the way Mengatoue be the shaman of he tribe as well and this be John Doolikahn who be the shaman of the Kalash and he be up in the mountain right on the border with Afghanistan in fact on that other side be the area Tora Bora the area where Osama bin Laden suppose to be this be the tribal area and we watch and stay with John Doolikahn and the shaman I do a whole series on shamanism which be a interesting phenomenon but around the world they go into trance in different way and in Pakistan the way they do it be they burn juniper leaf and they sacrifice a animal pour the blood of the animal on the leaf and then inhale the smoke and they be all pray to the mountain god as they go into trance you know get kid use to different reality I think be so important what Dan Dennett say the other day have a curriculum where they study different religion just to make a mental flexibility give they a mental flexibility in different belief system I think this be so necessary in we world today as you see this clash of belief take place and all the security issue they cause we so one thing we do five year ago we start a program that link kid in indigenous community with kid in the United States so we first hook up a spot in the Navajo Nation with a classroom in Seattle we now have 15 site we have one in Kathmandu Nepal Dharamsala India Takaungu Kenya Takaungu be one third Christian one third Muslim and one third animist the community be Ollantaytambo Peru and Arctic Village Alaska this be Daniel he be one of we student in Arctic Village Alaska he live in this log cabin no running water no heat other than no window and high speed internet connection and this be I see this roll out all over this be we site in Ollantaytambo Peru four year ago where they first see they first computer now they have computer in they classroom and the way we have do this we teach digital storytelling to this kid and we have they tell story about issue in they community in they community that they care about and this be in Peru where the kid tell the story about a river that they clean up and the way we do it be we do it in workshop and we bring person who want to learn digital workflow and storytelling and have they work with the kid and just this last year we have take a group of teenager in and this have work the good so we dream be to bring teenager together so they will have a community service experience as well as a cross cultural experience as they teach kid in this area and help they build they communication infrastructure this be teach photoshop in the Tibetan child village in Dharamsala we have the website where the kid all get they homepage this be all they movie we have get about 60 movie that this kid have make and they be quite incredible the one I want to show you after we get they to make the movie we have a night where we show the

you can go to we website and you will see the incredible work this kid do the other thing I want to give indigenous person a voice that be one of the big motivate factor but the other motivate factor be the insular nature of we country National Geographic just do a Roper Study of 18 to 26 year old in we country and in nine other industrialize country it be a two million dollar study United States come in second to last in geographic knowledge 70 percent of the kid could not find Afghanistan or Iraq on a map 60 percent could not find India 30 percent could not find the Pacific Ocean and this be
