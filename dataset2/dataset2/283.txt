we really need to put the good we have to offer within reach of we child if we do not do that we be go to get the generation we deserve they be go to learn from whatever it be they have around they and we as now the elite parent librarian professional whatever it be a bunch of we activity be in fact in try to get the good we have to offer within reach of that around we or as broadly as we can I be go to start and end this talk with a couple thing that be carve in stone one be what be on the Boston Public Library carve above they door be free to all it be kind of a inspiring statement and I will go back at the end of this I be a librarian and what I be try to do be bring all of the work of knowledge to as many person as want to read it and the idea of use technology be perfect for we I think we have the opportunity to one up the Greek it be not easy to one up the Greek but with the industriousness of the Egyptian they be able to build the Library of Alexandria the idea of a copy of every book of all the person of the world the problem be you actually have to go to Alexandria to go to it on the other hand if you do then great thing happen I think we can one up the Greek and achieve something and I be go to try to argue only one point today that universal access to all knowledge be within we grasp so if I be successful then you will actually come away think yeah we could actually achieve the great vision of everything ever publish everything that be ever mean for distribution available to anybody in the world that be ever want to have access to it yes there be issue about how money should be distribute and that be still be refigure out but I would say there be plenty of money and there be plenty of demand so we can actually achieve that but I be go to go over the technological social and sort of where be we as a whole try to get to that particular vision and the way I be go to try to do this be do it like the Amazon com website the book music video and just go step media type by media type just go and say all right how be we do on this so if we start with book you know sort of where be we well first you have to as a engineer scope the problem how big be it if you want to put all of the publish work online so that anybody could have it available well how big a problem be it well we do not really know but the large print library in the world be the Library of Congress it be 26 million volume 26 million volume it be by far and away the large print library in the world and a book if you have a book be about a megabyte so you know if you have it in Microsoft Word so a megabyte 26 million megabyte be 26 terabyte it go mega giga tera 26 terabyte 26 terabyte fit in a computer system that be about this big on spin Linux drive and it cost about 60 000 dollar so for the cost of a house or around here a garage you can put you can have spin all of the word in the Library of Congress that be pretty neat then the question be what do you get you know be it worth try to get there do you actually want it online some of the first thing that person do be they make book reader that allow you to search inside the book and that be kind of fun and you can download this thing and look around they in new and different way and you can get at they remotely if you happen to have a laptop there be start to be some of this sort of page turn y interface that look a whole lot like book in certain way and you can search they make little tab and it be kind of cute still very book like on you laptop but I do not know read thing on a laptop whenever I pull up my laptop it always feel like work I think that be one of the reason why the Kindle be so great I do not have to feel like I be at work to read a Kindle it be start to be a little bit more specified but I have to say that there be old technology that I tend to like I like the physical book and I think we can go and use we technology to go and digitize thing put they on the net and then download print they and bind they and end up with book again and we sort of say well how hard be this and it turn out to not be very hard we actually go off to make a bookmobile and a bookmobile the size of a van with a satellite dish a printer binder and cutter and kid make they own book it cost about three dollar to download print and bind a normal old book and they actually come out kind of nice look you can actually get really good look book for on the order of one penny per page sort of the part cost for do this so the idea of this technology actually may end up put book back in person hand again there be some other bookmobile run around this be Eric Eldred make book at Walden Pond Thoreau work this be just before he get kick out by the Parks Services for compete with the bookstore there in India they have get another couple bookmobile run around and this be the opening day at the Library of Alexandria the new Library of Alexandria in Egypt it be quite popularly attend and kid start to make they own book and a happy kid with the first book that he be ever own so the idea of be able to use this technology to end up with paper where I can handle sort of sound a little retro but I think it still have its place and be from the Silicon Valley sort of Utopian sort of world we think if we can make this technology work in rural Uganda we might have something so we actually get some funding from the World Bank to try it out and we find in about 30 day we could go and take a couple folk from Silicon Valley fly they to Uganda buy a car set up the first internet connection at the National Library of Uganda figure out what they want and get a program go make book in rural Uganda and it actually so technologically it work what we find out of this be we do not have the right book so the book be in the library we could get it to person if they be digitize but we do not know how to quite get they digitize everybody think the answer be send thing to India and China and so we have try that and I will go over that in a moment there be some new technology for deliver that have happen that be actually quite exciting as well one be a print on demand machine that look like a Rube Goldberg machine we have one of this thing now it be completely cool it be all conveyor belt and it make a book and it be call the Espresso Book Machine and in about 10 minute you can press a button and make a book something else I be quite excited about in this particular domain beyond this sort of kiosk y thing where you can get book on demand be some of this new little screen that be come out and one of my favorite in this be the 100 laptop and I do not mean to steal any thunder here but we have go and use one of this thing to be a e book reader so here be one of the beta unit and you can it actually turn out to be a really good look e book reader and we have a quick hack that we do to try to put one of we book on it and it turn out that 200 dot per inch mean that you can put scan book on they that look really good at 200 dot per inch it be kind of the equivalent of a 300 dot print laser printer we be in good enough shape you actually can go and read scan book quite easily so the idea of electronic book be start to come about but how do you go about do all this scanning so we think okay well let try out this send book to India thing and there be a project with fund by the National Science Foundation send a bunch of scanner and the American library be suppose to send book well they do not they do not want to send they book so we buy 100 000 book and send they to India and then we learn why you do not want to send book to India the lesson we learn out of this be scan you own book if you really care about book you be go to scan they better especially if they be valuable book if they be new book and you can just you know butcher they because you could just buy another one that be not such a big deal in term of do high quality scan but do thing that you love but the Indian have be scan a lot of they own book about 300 000 now do very well the Chinese do over a million and the Egyptian be about 30 000 but we send think ok if we be go to need to do this let do it in library how do we go and do this and how do we get it down so that it be a cost point that we could afford and we sort of pick the price point of 10 cent a page if it be basically the cost of xerox to basically digitize OCR package it up make it so that you could download print and bind it the whole shebang we would have achieve something so we start out try to figure out how do we get to 10 cent and we try this robot thing and they work pretty well sort of this auto page turn thing if we can have Mars Rovers you would think you could turn page but it actually turn out to be pretty hard to turn page and the volume be not there so anyway so we end up make we own book scanner and with two digital high grade professional digital camera control museum lighting so even if it be a black and white book you can go and get the proper intonation so you basically do a beautiful respectful job this be not a fax this be the idea be to do a beautiful job as you be go through this library and we have be able to achieve 10 cent a page if we run thing in volume this be what it look like at the University of Toronto and actually it turn out to you know pay a living wage person seem to love it yes it be a little boring but some person kind of get into the Zen of it laughter and especially if it be kind of interesting book that you care about in language that you can read we actually have be able to do a pretty good job of this at get 10 cent a page so 10 cent a page 300 page in you average book 30 dollar a book the Library of Congress if you do the whole darn thing 26 million book be about 750 million dollar right but a million book I think actually would be a pretty good start and that would cost 30 million dollar that be not that big a bill and what we have be able to do be get into library we have now get eight of this scanning center in three country and library be up for have they book scan the Getty here be move they book to the UCLA which be where we have one this scanning center and scan they out of copyright book which be fabulous so we be start to get the institutional responsibility the thing we be miss be the 10 cent if we can get the 10 cent all the rest of it flow we have scan about 200 000 book now we be scan about 15 000 book a month and it be start to gear up another factor of two from there so all in all that be go very well and we be start to move out of the just out of copyright into the out of print world so I think of we be kind of go from the out of copyright library stuff and Amazon com be come from the in print world and I think we will meet in the middle some place and have the classic thing that you have which be a publishing system and a library system work in parallel and so we be start up a program to do out of print work but loan they exactly what loan mean I be not quite sure but anyway loan out of print work from the Boston Public Library the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and a few other library that be start to participate in this program to try out this model of where do a library stop and where do the bookstore take over so all in all it be possible to do this in large scale we be also go back over microfilm and get that online so we can do 10 cent a page we be go 15 000 book a month and we have get about 250 000 book online count all the other project that be start to add in so what I want to argue be book be within we grasp the idea of take on the whole ball of wax be not that big a deal yes it cost ten of million low hundred of million but one time shot and we have get basically the history of print literature online and then there be business model issue about how to try to effectively market it and get it to person but it be within we grasp technologically and law wise at least for the out of print and out of copyright we suggest to be able to get the whole darn thing online now let go for audio and I be go to go through this so how much be there well as good we can tell there be about two to three million disk have be publish so 78 long play record and cd or at least that be the large archive of publish material we have be able to sort of point at it cost about 10 dollar a piece to go and take a disk and put it online if you be do thing in volume but we have find that the right issue be really quite thorny this be a fairly heavily litigate area so we have find that there be niche in the music world that be not serve terribly well by the classic commercial publishing system and we have be start to make this available by go and offer shelf space on the net in the United States it do not cost you to give something away right if you give something to a charity or to the public you get a pat on the back and a tax donation except on the net where you can go broke if you put up a video of you garage band and it start get heavily access you can lose you guitar or you house this do not make any sense so we have offer unlimited storage unlimited bandwidth forever for free to anybody that have something to share that belong in a library and we have be get a lot of taker one be the rock n roller the rock n roller have a tradition of sharing as long as nobody make any money you could concert record it be not the commercial recording but concert recording start by the Grateful Dead and we get about two or three band a day sign up they give permission and we get about 40 or 50 concert a day we have about 40 000 concert everything the Grateful Dead ever do up on the net so that person can see it and listen to this material so audio be possible to put up but the right issue be really pretty thorny we have get a lot of collection now a couple hundred thousand item and it be grow over time move image if you think of theatrical release there be not that many of they as good we can tell there be about 150 000 to 200 000 movie ever that be really mean for a large scale theatrical distribution it be just not that many but half of that be Indian but anyway it be doable but we have only find about a thousand of this thing that to be out of copyright so we have digitize that and make that available but we have find that there be lot of other type of movie that have not really see the light of day archival film we have find also a lot of political film a lot of amateur film all sort of thing that be basically need a home a permanent home so we have be start to make this available and it be grow to be very popular we be not quite a YouTube we tend towards long term thing and also thing that person can reuse and make into new movie which have just be great fun television come quite a bit large we start record 20 channel of television 24 hour a day it be sort of the big TiVo box you have ever see it be about a petabyte so far of worldwide television Russian Chinese Japanese Iraqi Al Jazeera BBC CNN ABC CBS NBC 24 hour a day we only put one week up which be mostly for cost reason which be the 9 11 sort of from 9 11 2001 for one week what do the world see CNN be say that Palestinian be dance in the street be they let look at the Palestinian television and find out how can we have critical thinking without be able to quote and be able to compare what happen in the past and television be dreadfully unrecorded and unquotable except by Jon Stewart who do a fabulous job so anyway television be I would suggest within we grasp so 15 dollar per video hour and also about 100 dollar to 150 dollar per celluloid hour we be able to go and get material online very inexpensively and have they up on the net and we have get now a lot of this material so we have get about 100 000 piece up there so book music video software there be only 50 000 title of it mostly the issue there be legal issue and break copy protection but we have work through some of that but we have still get real problem in Washington well we be good know as the world wide web we have be archive the world wide web since 1996 we take a snapshot of every website and all of the page on it every two month and actually it be really be pioneer by Alexa internet which donate this collection to the internet archive and it be be grow along for the last 11 year and it be a fantastic resource and we have make a Wayback machine that you can then go and see old website kind of the way they be if you go and search on something this be Google com the different version of it that we have this be what it look like when it be a alpha release and this be what it look like at Stanford so anyway you have get basically a idea of where thing come from mostly person want to see they old stuff out of this if there be one thing that we want to learn from the Library of Alexandria version one which be probably good know for burn be do not just have one copy so we have start to we have make another copy of all of this and we actually put it back in the Library of Alexandria so this be a picture of the internet archive at the Library of Alexandria and we now have also another copy build up in Amsterdam so we should put it in the San Andreas Fault line in San Francisco flood zone in Amsterdam and in the Middle East Right so anyway so we be hedge we bet here if we go and put it in a couple more place I think we will be in good shape there be a political and social question out of this be all of this as we go digital be it go to be public or private there be some large company that have see this vision that be do large scale digitization but they be lock up the public domain the question be be that the world that we really want to live in what be the role of the public versus the private as thing go forward how do we go and have a world where we both have library and publishing in the future just as we basically benefit as we be grow up so universal access to all knowledge I think it can be one of the great achievement of humankind like the man on the moon or the Gutenberg Bible or the Library of Alexandria it could be something that we be remember for for millennia for have achieve and as I say before I will end with something that be carve above the door of the Carnegie Library Carnegie one of the great capitalist of this country carve above he legacy free to the person thank you very much
