welcome to 10 000 foot let I explain why we be here and why some of you have a pine cone close to you once upon a time I do a book call how building learn today event you might call how mountain teach a little background for 10 year I have be try to figure out how to hack civilization so that we can get long term think to be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare or in some case non existent it would be helpful if humanity get into the habit of thinking of the now not just as next week or next quarter but you know next 10 000 year and the last 10 000 year basically civilization story so far so we have the long now Foundation in San Francisco it be a incubator for about a dozen project all have to do with continuity over the long term we core project be a rather ambitious folly I suppose a mythic undertaking to build a 10 000 year clock that can really keep good time for that long a period and the design problem of a project like that be just absolutely delicious go to the clock and what we have here be something many of you see here three year ago it be the first working prototype of the clock it be about nine foot high design by Danny Hillis and Alexander Rose it be presently in London and be tick away very deliberately at the science museum there so the design problem for today be go to be how do you house a eventual monumental clock like this so it can really tick save time beautifully for 100 century well this be the first solution Alexander Rose come up with this idea of a spiraloid tower with continuous slope ramp and it look like a way to go until you start think about what do deep time do to a building well this be what deep time do to a building this be the Parthenon it be only 2 450 year old and look what happen to it here be a beautiful project they really know it would last forever because they have build it out of absolutely huge stone and now it be a pathetic ruin and no one even know what it be use for that be what happen to building they be vulnerable even the most durable and intactable building like the pyramid of Giza be in bad shape when you look up close they have be loot inside and out and they be build to protect thing but they do not protect thing so we get to think if you can not put thing safely in a building where can you safely put they we think ok underground how about underground with a view Underground in a place that be really solid so the obvious answer be we need a mountain you do not want just any mountain you need absolutely the right mountain if you be go to have a clock for 10 000 year so here be a image of the long view of the search problem and we get to think for various reason it ought to be a desert mountain so we get look in the dry area of the Southwest we look at mesa in New Mexico we be look at dead volcano in Arizona then Roger Kennedy who be the director of the National Parks Service lead we to Eastern Nevada to America new and old national park which be call Great Basin National Park it be right on the eastern border of Nevada it be the high range in the state over 13 000 foot and you will notice that on the leave on the leave on the west it be very steep and on the right it be gentle this place be remote it be over 200 mile from any major city it be nowhere near any interstate or railroad and it be the only thing that go by be what be call America lonely highway u s 50 now inside the yellow line here on the right be that be all national park inside the green line be national forest and then over to the left be Bureau of Land Management land and some private land now as it happen that two mile long strip right in the middle this vertical be available because it be private land and thanks to Jay Walker who be here and Mitch Kapor who be here who start the process long now be able to get that two mile long strip of land and now let look at the grand truth of what be there we be in Pole Canyon look west up the western escarpment of Mount Washington which be 11 600 foot on top that white cliff be a dense Cambrian limestone that be a 2 000 foot thick formation and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock it would be a pilgrimage to get to it it would be a serious hike to get up to where the clock be so last June the Long now board some staff and some donor and advisor make a two week expedition to the mountain to explore it and investigate one if it be the right mountain and two if it be the right mountain how it might actually work for we now Danny Hillis sort of frame the problem he have a theory of how the overall clock experience should work it be what he call the seven stage of a mythic adventure it start with the image the image be a picture you have in you mind of the goal at the end of the journey in this case it might well be a image of the clock then there be the point of embarkation that be the point of transition from ordinary life to be a pilgrim on a quest then this be a nice image of it there be the labyrinth the labyrinth be a concept it be like a twilight zone it be a place where it be difficult where you get disoriented maybe you get scared but you have to go through it if you be go to get to some kind of deep reintegration then there should always be in sight the draw a kind of a beacon that draw you on through the labyrinth to finish the process of get there now Brian Eno who be be in the thick of the Long now process spend two year make a c d call January 7003 and it be Bell Studies for the clock of the long now base on part of it be base on a algorithm that Danny Hillis develop so that a peal of 10 bell make a different peal every day for 10 000 year the Hillis algorithm 10 factorial give you that number and in fact pretty soon we will hear the sound January 7003 there it be ok back to Danny list number five of the seven be the payoff this be it the climax the goal the main thing that you be try to get to and then Danny say a really great journey will have a secret payoff something you do not expect that cap what you do expect then there be the return you have get to have a gradual return to the ordinary world so you have time to assimilate what you have learn and then how about a memento number seven at the end of it there be something physical a kind of reward that you take away it might be a piece of a core drill of the mountain something that be just yours how do you study a mountain for the kind of thing we be talk about this be not a normal building project what do you look for what be the element that will most affect you idea and decision start with border if you look on the left side of the cliff here that be national park that be sacrosanct you can not do anything with that to the right of it be national forest there be possibility the border be important other element be mine weather approach and elevation and especially tree look at that thing up on top there it turn out that Mount Washington be cover with bristlecone pine they be the world old live thing person think they be just the size of shrub but that be not actually true there be tree on that mountain that be 5 000 year old and still live the wood be so solid it be like stone and it last for a long time so when you do tree ring study of trunk that be on the mountain some of they go back 10 000 year the stone itself be absolutely beautiful sculpt by millennia of very tough winter up there we have tree ring analyst from the University of Arizona join we on the expedition now if you guy have a pine cone handy now be a good time to put it in you hand and feel it especially on the end that be interesting you will find out why it be call a bristlecone pine a little sensory experience here be Danny Hillis in the midst of a bristlecone pine forest on long now land I should say that the age of bristlecone be discover lead by a theory Edmund Schulman in the 1950 have be study tree under great stress at Timberline and come to the realization that he put in a article in Science magazine call longevity under Adversity in Conifers and then base on that principle he start look around at the various tree at Timberline and realize that the bristlecone pine he find some in the White Mountains that be over 4 000 year old longevity under adversity be a pretty interesting design principle in its own right ok onto the mine the first ask price for the property when we look at it in 1998 be one billion dollar for 180 acre and a couple of mine because the owner say there be one billion dollar of beryllium in that mountain and we say wow that be great listen we will counter how about zero laughter and we be a non profit foundation you can give we the property and take a hell of a tax deduction laughter all you have to do be prove to the government it be worth a billion dollar well a few year go by and there be some kind of back and forth and by and by thanks to Mitch and Jay we be able to buy the whole property for 140 000 dollar this be one of the mine it do not have any beryllium in it it be call the Pole Adit and it do have tungsten a little bit of tungsten leave over that be the kind of mine it be but it go a mile and a half in a straight line due east into the range into very interesting territory except that as you will see when we go inside in a minute we be hope for limestone but in there be just shale and shale be not quite completely competent rock competent rock be rock that will hold itself up without any shore the shale would like some shore and so part of it be cave in in there that be Ben Roberts from he be the bat specialist from the National Park but there be many wonder back in there like this weird fungus on some of the collapse timber ok here be another mine that be up on top of the property and it date back to 1870 that be what the property be originally build around it be a set of mining claim it be a very productive silver mine in fact it be the high operating mine in Nevada and it run year round you can imagine what it be like in the winter at 10 000 foot you may recognize a couple of the miner there there be Jeff Bezos on the right and Paul Saville on the left look for galena which be the lead silver thing they do not find any they both keep they day job here be the last mine it be call the Bonanza Adit it be down in a canyon and Alexander Rose on the leave there work with a bunch of person from the National Park to survey the whole mine it be a mile deep and they also find four species of bat in there now almost all that mine by the way meet underneath the mountain they do not quite but it be something to think about they do not quite meet let go to weather mountain specialize in interesting weather way more interesting than Monterey even today and so one Tuesday morning last June there we be wake up in the morning the mountain be cover with snow that be a great time to go up and visit we weather station which again thanks to Mitch Kapor we be build up there and it be a pretty interesting scene this be on the leave there the joyful lady be Pat Irwin who be the regional head of the National Forest Service and they give we the temporary use permit to be there we want a temporary use permit for the clock eventually 10 000 year temporary use permit laughter the weather station pretty interesting Kurt Bollacker and Alexander Rose design a radically wireless station it run on solar and it send a signal with that antenna and bounce it off of micrometeorite trail in the atmosphere to a place in Bozeman Montana where the datum be take down and then send through landline to San Francisco where we put the datum in real time up on we website and there you see a week of weather at 9 400 foot on Mount Washington let go to approach as it happen there be no trail anywhere on Mount Washington just a few old mining road like this so you have to bushwhack everywhere but there be no bear and there be no poison oak and there be basically no person because this place have be empty for a long time you can hike for day and not encounter anybody well here be a potential approach you need to come up the Lincoln Canyon it be this beautiful world all of its own surround by cliff and it be a easy hike to stroll up the canyon bottom until you get to this barrier and it actually present a problem so you can scratch Lincoln Canyon as a approach another possible approach be right up the western front of the mountain you can see why we sometimes call it Long Mountain and from where you be stand at 6 000 foot in the valley it be a easy hike up to the mature pinyon and juniper forest through that knoll at the front at 7 600 foot and you can carry right on up through meadow and steepen forest to the high base of the cliff at 10 500 foot where there be a bit of a problem now Jeff Bezos advise we when he leave at the end of the expedition make the clock inaccessible the hard it be to get to the more person will value it and check that be 600 foot vertical wall there so Alexander Rose want to explore this route and he start over here on the leave from he pickup truck at 8 900 foot and head up the mountain now as you gain elevation you iq go down laughter but you emotional affect go up which be great for have a mythic experience whether you want to or not in fact Danny Hillis can estimate altitude by how much math he can not do in he head laughter now I happen to be on the radio with Alexander when he get to this point at the base of the cliff and he say quote there be a hidden notch I think I can get up a way now he be a rock climber but you know he be we executive director I do not want he kill I know he be go to love cliff I be say be careful be careful be careful then he start go up and the next thing I hear be I be half way up it be like climb stair I be go up 60 degree it be a secret passage it be like something from Tolkien and I be go careful careful please be careful and then of course the next thing I hear be I have make it to the top you can see all of creation from up here and he dash across the top of the mountain in fact there he be that be Alexander Rose First ascent of the western face to Mount Washington and a solo ascent at that this discovery change everything about we sense of this cliff and what to do with they we realize that we have to name this thing that Alexander discover how about Zander crevice no laughter so we finally decide on Alexander Siq Zander siq be name after some of you have be to Petra there be this wonderful slot canyon that lead into Petra call the siq and so this be the siq and it really be hide I can not find it in this image and I be not sure you can only when you get fresh snow can you see just along the rim there and that bring it out now Danny and I be up at this same area one day and Danny look over to the right and notice something halfway up the cliff which be a kind of a porch or a cliff shelf with bristlecone on it and suppose that person go up to the clock inside the mountain could come out onto that shelf and look down at the view and the person toil up the mountain could see they this tiny little person up there incredibly halfway up the cliff how do they get there do I have to do that and so that maybe become part of the draw and part of the labyrinth you can get another angle on Danny porch by go around to the south and look north at the whole formation there and you need to know that Danny clock be to be keep accurate by a ray of sunshine that perfect noon hit it every sunny day and the pulse of heat from that set off a solar trigger which reset the clock to make it perfectly accurate so even with the slowing of the rotation of the earth and so on the clock will keep perfectly good time so here we be look from the south look north this be all Forest Service land if you go up on top of that cliff that be some of the long now land in that tree and if you go up there and look back then you will get a sense of what the view start to be like from the top of the mountain that be the long view that be 80 mile to the horizon and that be also timberline and that bristlecone really be shrub that be a different place to be it be 11 400 foot and it be exquisite now if you go over to the right from this image to look at the edge of the cliff it be 600 foot just about a yard to the left of Kurt Bollacker foot there be a 600 foot drop he be amble on over to Zander siq that be what it look like look down it we should probably put in a rail or something over on the eastern side it be gentle as you can see and that be not snow that be what the white limestone look like you also see there a bighorn sheep they herd be reintroduce from Wyoming and they be do pretty well but they have get a bit of trouble this be Danny Hillis and he be figure out a design problem he be try to determine if where he be on a bit of long now land would appear from down in the valley to be the actual peak of the mountain because the real peak be hide around the corner this be what in the infantry we use to call the military crest and as it turn out the answer be yes that be from down below in the valley it do look like the peak and that might be conjure with we gradually realize we have three serious design domain to work on with this one be the experience of the mountain another be the experience in the mountain and the third be the experience from the mountain which be really dominate by the view shed of the spring valley there behind Danny and if you look off to the right out there 15 mile across to the Schell Creek range in the front there be 10 ranch string right along the base of the mountain use the water from the mountain in fact there be artesian well where water spring right into the air one of the ranch be call the Kirkeby Ranch and I will take you there for a minute it be a very nice ranch alfalfa and cattle run by Paul and Ronnie Brenham and it be pretty idyllic it be also hard work and most of this ranch be have trouble keep go this be they view to the west of the Schell Creek range and if you go out to that line of tree at the far end you will see what the valley use to look like this be Rocky Mountain juniper that have be there for thousand of year and a scheme emerge that Long now be look to see if it might be possible to buy up the whole valley because that 10 ranch with they 17 000 acre dominate a 500 square mile valley with they grazing allotment and so on and there be a possibility that you could get the whole thing for five million dollar and gradually restore it to its wild condition and somewhere in the process turn it back over to the National Park and it would double the size of Great Basin National Park that would be swell ok let take one more look at the mountain itself the clock experience should be profound but from the outside it should be invisible now at the base of the high cliff there be this natural cave it be only about 12 foot deep but what if it be deepen from inside you excavate from somewhere come up from inside and deepen it and then you could have a entrance which be very rough and narrow as you first go in that gradually become more refined and then actually quite exquisite and this stone take a perfect Polish you would have a polished set of passage and chamber in there eventually lead to the 10 000 year clock and it be not a mine this would be a nuanced evocation of the basic structure of the mountain and you would be appreciate it as much from inside as you do from outside this be architecture not make by build but by what you very carefully take away so that be what the mountain teach we most of the amazingness of the clock we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain all we have to do be highlight its spectacular feature and blend in with they it be not a clock in a mountain it be a mountain clock now the Tewa Indian in the Southwest have a say for what you need to do when you want to think long term about anything they say pin peya obe welcome to the mountain thank you applause
