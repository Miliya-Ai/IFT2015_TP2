I and my colleague art Aron and Lucy Brown and other have put 37 person who be madly in love into a functional mri brain scanner 17 who be happily in love 15 who have just be dump and we be just start we third experiment study person who report that they be still in love after 10 to 25 year of marriage so this be the short story of that research in the jungle of Guatemala in Tikal stand a temple it be build by the grand Sun King of the grand city state of the grand civilization of the Americas the Mayas he name be Jasaw Chan K awiil he stand over six foot tall he live into he 80 and he be bury beneath this monument in 720 ad and mayan inscription proclaim that he be deeply in love with he wife so he build a temple in she honor face he and every spring and autumn exactly at the equinox the sun rise behind he temple and perfectly bathe she temple with he shadow and as the sun set behind she temple in the afternoon it perfectly bathe he temple with she shadow after 1 300 year this two lover still touch and kiss from they tomb around the world person love they sing for love they dance for love they compose poem and story about love they tell myth and legend about love they pine for love they live for love they kill for love and they die for love as Walt Whitman once say o I would stake all for you Anthropologists have find evidence of romantic love in 170 society they have never find a society that do not have it but love be not always a happy experience in one study of college student they ask a lot of question about love but the two that stand out to I the most be have you ever be reject by somebody who you really love and the second question be have you ever dump somebody who really love you and almost 95 percent of both man and woman say yes to both almost nobody get out of love alive so before I start tell you about the brain I want to read for you what I think be the most powerful love poem on Earth there be other love poem that be of course just as good but I do not think this one can be surpass it be tell by a anonymous Kwakiutl Indian of southern Alaska to a missionary in 1896 and here it be I have never have the opportunity to say it before Fire run through my body with the pain of love you Pain run through my body with the fire of my love for you Pain like a boil about to burst with my love for you consume by fire with my love for you I remember what you say to I I be think of you love for I I be tear by you love for I Pain and more pain where be you go with my love I be tell you will go from here I be tell you will leave I here my body be numb with grief remember what I say my love Goodbye my love goodbye Emily Dickinson once write parting be all we need to know of hell how many person have suffer in all the million of year of human evolution how many person around the world be dance with elation at this very minute romantic love be one of the most powerful sensation on Earth so several year ago I decide to look into the brain and study this madness we first study of person who be happily in love have be widely publicize so I be only go to say very little about it we find activity in a tiny little factory near the base of the brain call the ventral tegmental area we find activity in some cell call the a10 cell cell that actually make dopamine a natural stimulant and spray it to many brain region indeed this part the VTA be part of the brain reward system it be way below you cognitive thinking process it be below you emotion it be part of what we call the reptilian core of the brain associate with want with motivation with focus and with craving in fact the same brain region where we find activity become active also when you feel the rush of cocaine but romantic love be much more than a cocaine high at least you come down from cocaine romantic love be a obsession it possess you you lose you sense of self you can not stop think about another human being somebody be camp in you head as a eighth century Japanese poet say my longing have no time when it cease Wild be love and the obsession can get bad when you have be reject so right now Lucy Brown and I the neuroscientist on we project be look at the datum of the person who be put into the machine after they have just be dump it be very difficult actually put this person in the machine because they be in such bad shape laughter so anyway we find activity in three brain region we find activity in the brain region in exactly the same brain region associate with intense romantic love what a bad deal you know when you have be dump the one thing you love to do be just forget about this human being and then go on with you life but no you just love they hard as the poet Terence the Roman poet once say he say the less my hope the hot my love and indeed we now know why two thousand year later we can explain this in the brain that brain system the reward system for want for motivation for craving for focus become more active when you can not get what you want in this case life great prize a appropriate mating partner we find activity in other brain region also in a brain region associate with calculate gain and loss you be lie there you be look at the picture and you be in this machine and you be calculate what go wrong what have I lose as a matter of fact Lucy and I have a little joke about this it come from a David Mamet play and there be two con artist in the play and the woman be con the man and the man look at the woman and say oh you be a bad pony I be not go to bet on you and indeed it be this part of the brain the core of the nucleus accumben that be become active as you be measure you gain and loss it be also the brain region that become active when you be willing to take enormous risk for huge gain and huge loss last but not least we find activity in a brain region associate with deep attachment to another individual no wonder person suffer around the world and we have so many crime of passion when you have be reject in love not only be you engulf with feeling of romantic love but you be feel deep attachment to this individual moreover this brain circuit for reward be work and you be feel intense energy intense focus intense motivation and the willingness to risk it all to win life great prize so what have I learn from this experiment that I would like to tell the world foremost I have come to think that romantic love be a drive a basic mating drive not the sex drive the sex drive get you look for a whole range of partner romantic love enable you to focus you mating energy on just one at a time conserve you mating energy and start the mating process with this single individual I think of all the poetry that I have read about romantic love what sum it up good be something that be say by Plato over 2 000 year ago he say the god of love live in a state of need it be a need it be a urge it be a homeostatic imbalance like hunger and thirst it be almost impossible to stamp out I have also come to believe that romantic love be a addiction a perfectly wonderful addiction when it be go well and a perfectly horrible addiction when it be go poorly and indeed it have all of the characteristic of addiction you focus on the person you obsessively think about they you crave they you distort reality you willingness to take enormous risk to win this person and it be get the three main characteristic of addiction tolerance you need to see they more and more and more withdrawal and last relapse I have get a girlfriend who be just get over a terrible love affair it be be about eight month she be begin to feel well and she be drive along in she car the other day and suddenly she hear a song on the car radio that remind she of this man not only do the instant craving come back but she have to pull over from the side of the road and cry so one thing I would like the medical community and the legal community and even the college community to see if they can understand that indeed romantic love be one of the most addictive substance on Earth I would also like to tell the world that animal love there be not a animal on this planet that will copulate with anything that come along too old too young too scruffy too stupid and they will not do it unless you be stick in a laboratory cage and you know if you spend you entire life in a little box you be not go to be as picky about who you have sex with but I have look in a hundred species and everywhere in the wild animal have favorite as a matter of fact ethologist know this there be over eight word for what they call animal favoritism selective proceptivity mate choice female choice sexual choice and indeed there be now three academic article in which they have look at this attraction which may only last for a second but it be a definite attraction and either this same brain region this reward system or the chemical of that reward system be involved in fact I think animal attraction can be instant you can see a elephant instantly go for another elephant and I think that this be really the origin of what you and I call love at first sight person have often ask I whether what I know about love have spoil it for I and I just simply say hardly you can know every single ingredient in a piece of chocolate cake and then when you sit down and eat that cake you can still feel that joy and certainly I make all the same mistake that everybody else do too but it be really deepen my understanding and compassion really for all human life as a matter of fact in New York I often catch myself look in baby carriage and feel a little sorry for the tot and in fact sometimes I feel a little sorry for the chicken on my dinner plate when I think of how intense this brain system be we new experiment have be hatch by my colleague art Aron put person who be report that they be still in love in a long term relationship into the functional mri we have put five person in so far and indeed we find exactly the same thing they be not lie the brain area associate with intense romantic love still become active 25 year later there be still many question to be answer and ask about romantic love the question that I be work on right this minute and I be only go to say it for a second and then end be why do you fall in love with one person rather than another I never would have even think to think of this but Match com the internet dating site come to I three year ago and ask I that question and I say I do not know I know what happen in the brain when you do become in love but I do not know why you fall in love with one person rather than another and so I have spend the last three year on this and there be many reason that you fall in love with one person rather than another that psychologist can tell you and we tend to fall in love with somebody from the same socioeconomic background the same general level of intelligence of good look the same religious value you childhood certainly play a role but nobody know how and that be about it that be all they know no they have never find the way two personality fit together to make a good relationship so it begin to occur to I that maybe you biology pull you towards some person rather than another and I have concoct a questionnaire to see to what degree you express dopamine serotonin estrogen and testosterone I think we have evolve four very broad personality type associate with the ratio of this four chemical in the brain and on this dating site that I have create call Chemistry com I ask you first a series of question to see to what degree you express this chemical and I be watch who choose who to love and 3 7 million person have take the questionnaire in America about 600 000 person have take it in 33 other country I be put the datum together now and at some point there will always be magic to love but I think I will come close to understand why it be you can walk into a room and everybody be from you background you same general level of intelligence good look and you do not feel pull towards all of they I think there be biology to that I think we be go to end up in the next few year to understand all kind of brain mechanism that pull we to one person rather than another so I will close with this this be my old person Faulkner say the past be not dead it be not even past indeed we carry a lot of luggage from we yesteryear in the human brain and so there be one thing that make I pursue my understanding of human nature and this remind I of it this be two woman woman tend to get intimacy differently than man do woman get intimacy from face to face talk we swivel towards each other we do what we call the anchor gaze and we talk this be intimacy to woman I think it come from million of year of hold that baby in front of you face cajole it reprimand it educate it with word man tend to get intimacy from side by side do as soon as one guy look up the other guy will look away laughter I think it come from million of year sit behind the bush look straight ahead try to hit that buffalo on the head with a rock I think for million of year man face they enemy they sit side by side with friend so my final statement be love be in we it be deeply embed in the brain we challenge be to understand each other thank you applause
