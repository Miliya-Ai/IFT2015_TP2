my search be always to find way to chronicle to share and to document story about person just everyday person story that offer transformation that lean into transcendence but that be never sentimental that never look away from the dark thing about we because I really believe that we be never more beautiful than when we be most ugly because that be really the moment we really know what we be make of as Chris say I grow up in Nigeria with a whole generation in the 80 of student who be protest a military dictatorship which have finally end so it be not just I there be a whole generation of we but what I have come to learn be that the world be never save in grand messianic gesture but in the simple accumulation of gentle soft almost invisible act of compassion everyday act of compassion in South Africa they have a phrase call Ubuntu Ubuntu come out of a philosophy that say the only way for I to be human be for you to reflect my humanity back at I but if you be like I my humanity be more like a window I do not really see it I do not pay attention to it until there be you know like a bug that be dead on the window then suddenly I see it and usually it be never good it be usually when I be cussing in traffic at someone who be try to drive they car and drink coffee and send email and make note so what Ubuntu really say be that there be no way for we to be human without other person it be really very simple but really very complicated so I think I should start with some story I should tell you some story about remarkable person so I think I would start with my mother laughter and she be dark too my mother be English my parent meet in Oxford in the 50 and my mother move to Nigeria and live there she be five foot two very feisty and very English this be how English my mother be or be she just pass she come out to California to Los Angeles to visit I and we go to Malibu which she think be very disappointing laughter and then we go to a fish restaurant and we have Chad the surfer dude serve we and he come up and my mother say do you have any special young man and Chad say sure like we have this like salmon that be like roll in this like wasabi like crust it be totally rad and my mother turn to I and say what language be he speak laughter I say English mum and she shake she head and say oh this American we give they a language why do not they use it laughter so this woman who convert from the Church of England to Catholicism when she marry my father and there be no one more rabid than a catholic convert decide to teach in the rural area in Nigeria particularly among igbo woman the billing ovulation method which be the only approve birth control by the Catholic Church but she Igbo be not too good so she take I along to translate I be seven laughter so here be this woman who never discuss they period with they husband and here I be tell they well how often do you get you period laughter and do you notice any discharge laughter and how swollen be you vulva laughter she never would have think of herself as a feminist my mother but she always use to say anything a man can do I can fix applause and when my father complain about this situation where she be take a seven year old boy to teach this birth control you know he use to say oh you be turn he into you be teach he how to be a woman my mother say someone have to laughter this woman during the biafran war we be catch in the war it be my mother with five little child it take she one year through refugee camp after refugee camp to make she way to a airstrip where we can fly out of the country at every single refugee camp she have to face off soldier who want to take my elder brother Mark who be nine and make he a boy soldier can you imagine this five foot two woman stand up to man with gun who want to kill we all through that one year my mother never cry one time not once but when we be in Lisbon in the airport about to fly to England this woman see my mother wear this dress which have be wash so many time it be basically see through with five really hungry look kid come over and ask she what have happen and she tell this woman and so this woman empty out she suitcase and give all of she clothes to my mother and to we and the toy of she kid who do not like that very much but laughter that be the only time she cry and I remember year later I be write about my mother and I ask she why do you cry then and she say you know you can steel you heart against any kind of trouble any kind of horror but the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger will unstitch you the old woman in my father village after this war have happen memorize the name of every dead person and they would sing this dirge make up of this name dirge so melancholic that they would scorch you and they would sing they only when they plant the rice as though they be seed the heart of the dead into the rice but when it come for harvest time they would sing this joyful song that be make up of the name of every child who have be bear that year and then the next planting season when they sing the dirge they would remove as many name of the dead that equal as many person that be bear and in this way this woman enact a lot of transformation beautiful transformation do you know that before the genocide in Rwanda the word for rape and the word for marriage be the same one but today woman be rebuild Rwanda do you also know that after apartheid when the new government go into the parliament house there be no female toilet in the building which would seem to suggest that apartheid be entirely the business of man all of this to say that despite the horror and despite the death woman be never really count they humanity never seem to matter very much to we when I be grow up in Nigeria and I should not say Nigeria because that be too general but in Afikpo the Igbo part of the country where I be from there be always rite of passage for young man man be teach to be man in the way in which we be not woman that be essentially what it be and a lot of ritual involve kill kill little animal progress along so when I turn 13 and I mean it make sense it be a agrarian community somebody have to kill the animal there be no whole Foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at so when I turn 13 it be my turn now to kill a goat and I be this weird sensitive kid who could not really do it but I have to do it and I be suppose to do this alone but a friend of mine call Emmanuel who be significantly old than I who have be a boy soldier during the biafran war decide to come with I which sort of make I feel good because he have see a lot of thing now when I be grow up he use to tell I story about how he use to bayonet person and they intestine would fall out but they would keep run so this guy come with I and I do not know if you have ever hear a goat or see one they sound like human being that be why we call tragedy a song of a goat my friend Brad Kessler say that we do not become human until we start keep goat anyway a goat eye be like a child eye so when I try to kill this goat and I could not emmanuel bend down he put he hand over the mouth of the goat cover its eye so I do not have to look into they while I kill the goat it do not seem like a lot for this guy who have see so much and to whom the killing of a goat must have seem such a quotidian experience still find it in himself to try to protect I I be a wimp I cry for a very long time and afterwards he do not say a word he just sit there watch I cry for a hour and then afterwards he say to I it will always be difficult but if you cry like this every time you will die of heartbreak just know that it be enough sometimes to know that it be difficult of course talk about goat make I think of sheep and not in good way laughter so I be bear two day after Christmas so grow up you know I have a cake and everything but I never get any present because bear two day after Christmas so I be about nine and my uncle have just come back from Germany and we have the catholic priest over my mother be entertain he with tea and my uncle suddenly say where be Chris present and my mother say do not talk about that in front of guest but he be desperate to show that he would just come back so he summon I up and he say go into the bedroom my bedroom take anything you want out of the suitcase it be you birthday present I be sure he think I would take a book or a shirt but I find a inflatable sheep laughter so I blow it up and run into the living room my finger where it should not have be I be wave this buzz sheep around and my mother look like she be go to die of shock laughter and Father McGetrick be completely unflustered just stir he tea and look at my mother and say it be all right Daphne I be Scottish laughter applause my last day in prison the last 18 month my cellmate for the last year the first year of the last 18 month my cellmate be 14 year old the name be John James and in that day if a family member commit a crime the military would hold you as ransom till you family turn themselves in so here be this 14 year old kid on death row and not everybody on death row be a political prisoner there be some really bad person there and he have smuggle in two comic two comic book Spiderman and X Men he be obsess and when he get tired of read they he start to teach the man in death row how to read with this comic book and so I remember night after night you would hear all this man this really harden criminal huddle around John James recite take that spidey laughter it be incredible I be really worried he do not know what death row mean I have be there twice and I be terribly afraid that I be go to die and he would always laugh and say come on man we will make it out then I would say how do you know and he say oh I hear it on the grapevine they kill he they handcuff he to a chair and they tack he penis to a table with a six inch nail then leave he there to bleed to death that be how I end up in solitary because I let my feeling be know all around we everywhere there be person like this the Igbo use to say that they build they own god they would come together as a community and they would express a wish and they wish would then be bring to a priest who would find a ritual object and the appropriate sacrifice would be make and the shrine would be build for the god but if the god become unruly and begin to ask for human sacrifice the Igbos would destroy the god they would knock down the shrine and they would stop say the god name this be how they come to reclaim they humanity every day all of we here we be build god that have go rampant and it be time we start knock they down and forget they name it do not require a tremendous thing all it require be to recognize among we every day the few of we that can see be surround by person like the one I have tell you there be some of you in this room amazing person who offer all of we the mirror to we own humanity I want to end with a poem by a American poet call Lucille Clifton the poem be call libation and it be for my friend Vusi who be in the audience here somewhere Libation North
