I be a contemporary artist and I show in art gallery and museum I show a number of photograph and film but I also make television program book and some advertising all with the same concept and it be about we fixation with celebrity and celebrity culture and the importance of the image celebrity be bear of photography I be go to start with how I start with this concept seven year ago when Princess Diana die there be a sort of a standstill in Britain the moment of she death and person decide to mourn she death in a sort of mass way I be fascinate by this phenomenon so I wonder could one erase the image of Diana actually quite crudely and physically so I get a gun and start to shoot at the image of Diana but I could not erase this from my memory and certainly it be not be erase from the public psyche momentum be be build the press write about she death in rather I feel pornographic way like which bit of artery leave which bit of body and how do she die in the back of the car and I be intrigue by this sort of mass voyeurism so I make this rather gory image I then go on wonder whether I could actually replace she image so I get a look alike of Diana and pose she in the right position and angle and create something that be in or exist in the public imagination so person be wonder be she go to marry Dodi be she in love with he be she pregnant do she want he baby be she pregnant when she die so I create this image of Diana Dodi and they imaginary mixed race child and this image come out which cause a huge public outcry at the time I then go on to make more comment on the media and press imagery so I start make reference to media imagery make it grainy shot through doorway and so on and so forth to titillate the public or the viewer further in term of try to make the viewer more aware of they own voyeurism so this be a image of Diana look at Camilla kiss she husband and this be a sequence of image and this get show in art gallery like this as a sequence and similarly with the Di Dodian baby imagery this be another art gallery installation I be particularly interested in how you can not rely on you own perception this be Jane Smith and Jo Bloggs for instance but you think it be Camilla and the Queen and I be fascinate how what you think be real be not necessarily real and the camera can lie and it make it very very easy with the mass bombardment of imagery to tell untruth so I continue to work on this project of how photography seduce we and be more interesting to look at than the actual real subject matter and at the same time it remove we from the real subject matter and this act as a sort of titillate thing so the photograph become this teaser and incite desire and voyeurism what you can not have you want more in the photograph the real subject do not exist so it make you want that person more and that be the way I think that celebrity magazine work now the more picture you see of this celebrity the more you feel you know they but you do not know they and you want to know they further of course the Queen go to she stud often to watch she horse watch she horse laughter and then I be sort of make imagery in England there be a expression you can not imagine the queen on the loo so I be try to penetrate that well here be the image all this imagery be create a lot of fuss and I be cite as a disgusting artist the press be write about this give full page about how terrible this be which I find very interesting that it be go full cycle I be make comment about the press and about how we know fact and information only by media because we do not know the real person very few of we know the real person but it be go back into the press and they be publicize effectively my filthy work so this be broadsheet tabloid debate be be have all about this work film be be ban before person have actually have the look at the work politician be get involve all sort of thing great headline then suddenly it start to get on front page I be be ask and pay to do front cover suddenly I be become sort of acceptable which I find also fascinating how one moment it be disgusting journalist would lie to I to get a story or a photograph of I say my work be wonderful and the next minute there be terrible headline about I but then this change suddenly I then start to work for magazine and newspaper this be for example a image that go into Tatler this be another newspaper image it be a April fool actually and to this day some person think it be real I be sit next to someone at dinner the other day and they be say there be this great image of the Queen sit outside William Hill they think it be real I be explore at the time the hyperbole of icon and Diana and Marilyn and the importance of celebrity in we life how they wheedle they way into the collective psyche without we even know and how that should happen I explore with actually dress up as the celebrity myself there be I as Diana I look like the mass murderer Myra Hindley I think in this one laughter and I as the Queen I then continue on to make a whole body of work about Marilyn the big icon of all and try to titillate by shoot through doorway and shutter and so on and so forth and only show certain angle to create a reality that obviously be completely construct this be the look alike so the craft element of this be completely enormous she look nothing like Marilyn but by the time we have make she up and put wig and makeup on she look exactly like Marilyn to the extent that she husband could not recognize she or recognize this look alike in this photograph which I find quite interesting so all this work be get show in art gallery then I make a book I be also make a tv series for the BBC at the time Stills from the tv series go into this book but there be a real legal problem because it look real but how do you get over that because obviously it be make a comment about we culture right now that we can not tell what real how do we know when we be look at something whether it be real or not so from my point of view it be important to publish it but at the same time it do cause a confusion intentional on my behalf but problematic for any outlet that I be work with so a big disclaimer be put on everything that I do and I make narrative about all the European or brit celebrity and comment about we public figure you know what do Tony Blair get up to in private with he fashion guru and also deal with the perception that be put about Bin Laden Saddam Hussein the link that be put about pre Iraq war and what be go to happen to the monarchy because obviously the British public I think would prefer William to Charles on the throne and it be that wish or that desire that I suppose I be deal with in my work I be not really interested in the celebrity themselves I be interested in the perception of the celebrity and with some look alike they be so good you do not know whether they be real or not I do a advertising campaign for Schweppes which be Coca Cola and so that be very interesting in term of the legality it be highly commercial but it be a difficulty for I because this be my artwork should I do advertising at the time so I make sure the work be not compromise in any way and that the integrity of the work remain the same but the meaning change in the sense that with the logo on you be close all the line of interpretation down to sell a product and that be all you be do when you take the logo off you be open up the interpretation and make the work inconclusive oppose to conclusive when you be advertise this image be quite interesting actually because I think we make it three year ago and it be Camilla in she wedding dress which again nearly get re use now recently prior to she wedding Tony Blair and Cherie and again the legality we have to be very careful it be obviously a very big commercial company and so this little shh it be not really they be put on the side of the imagery and Margaret Thatcher visit Jeffery Archer in jail I then be ask by Selfridges to do a series of window for they so I build a sauna bath in one of they window and create little scene live scene with look alike inside the window and the window be all steam up so it be Tony Blair reading and practice he speech I have get they do yoga inside there with Carole Caplin Sven make out with Ulrika Jonsson who he be have a affair with at that time this be a huge success for they because the imagery get show in the press the day after in every single newspaper broadsheet and tabloid it be a bit of a road stopper which be problematic because the police keep on try to clear away the crowd but huge fun it be great for I to do a performance also person be take photograph of this so it be be text around the world extremely quickly all this imagery and the press be interview and I be sign my book laughter further imagery I be make a new book now with Taschen that I be work on really for a sort of global market my previous book be only for the U K market that I suppose it could be call humorous I suppose I come from a sort of non humorous background with serious intent and then suddenly my work be funny and I think it do not really matter that my work be consider humorous in a way I think it be a way in for I to deal with the importance of imagery and how we read all we information through imagery it be a extremely fast way of get information it be extremely difficult if it be construct correctly and there be technique of construct iconic imagery this image for example be sort of spot on because it exactly sum up what Elton may be do in private and also what might be happen with Saddam Hussein and George Bush read the Koran upside down for example George Bush target practice shooting at Bin Laden and Michael Moore and then you change the photograph he be shoot at and it suddenly become rather grim and maybe less accessible laughter Tony Blair be use as a mount block and Rumsfeld and Bush laugh with some Abu Ghraib photo behind and the seriousness or the intellect of Bush and also comment on the behind the scene well as we know now what go on in prison and in fact George Bush and Tony Blair be have great fun during all of this and really comment you know base on the perception we have of the celebrity what Jack Nicholson might be up to in he celebrity life and the fact that he try to he have a bit of road rage and golf club a driver the other day I mean it be extremely difficult to find this look alike so I be constantly go up to person in the street and try to ask person to come and be in one of my photograph or film and sometimes ask the real celebrity mistake they for someone who just look like the real person which be highly embarrassing laughter I have also be work with the Guardian on a topical basis a page a week in they newspaper which have be very interesting work topically so Jamie Oliver and school dinner Bush and Blair have difficulty get alongside Muslim culture the whole of the hunting issue and the royal family refuse to stop hunt and the tsunami issue and obviously Harry Blair view on Gordon Brown which I find very interesting Condi and Bush this image I have decide to show have a reservation about it I make it a year ago and just how meaning change and there be a terrible thing that have happen but the fear be lurk around in we mind prior to that that be why this image be make one year ago and what it mean today so I will leave you with this clip to have a look music Chris Anderson thank you
