image like this from the Auschwitz concentration camp have be sear into we consciousness during the twentieth century and have give we a new understanding of who we be where we have come from and the time we live in during the twentieth century we witness the atrocity of Stalin Hitler Mao Pol Pot Rwanda and other genocide and even though the twenty first century be only seven year old we have already witness a ongoing genocide in Darfur and the daily horror of Iraq this have lead to a common understanding of we situation namely that modernity have bring we terrible violence and perhaps that native people live in a state of harmony that we have depart from to we peril here be a example from a op ed on Thanksgiving in the Boston Globe a couple of year ago where the writer write the Indian life be a difficult one but there be no employment problem community harmony be strong substance abuse unknown crime nearly non existent what warfare there be between tribe be largely ritualistic and seldom result in indiscriminate or wholesale slaughter now you be all familiar with this treacle we teach it to we child we hear it on television and in storybook now the original title of this session be Everything You Know be wrong and I be go to present evidence that this particular part of we common understanding be wrong that in fact we ancestor be far more violent than we be that violence have be in decline for long stretch of time and that today we be probably live in the most peaceful time in we species existence now in the decade of Darfur and Iraq a statement like that might seem somewhere between hallucinatory and obscene but I be go to try to convince you that that be the correct picture the decline of violence be a fractal phenomenon you can see it over millennia over century over decade and over year although there seem to have be a tip point at the onset of the age of reason in the sixteenth century one see it all over the world although not homogeneously it be especially evident in the West begin with England and Holland around the time of the Enlightenment let I take you on a journey of several power of 10 from the millennium scale to the year scale to try to persuade you of this until 10 000 year ago all human live as hunter gatherer without permanent settlement or government and this be the state that be commonly think to be one of primordial harmony but the archaeologist Lawrence Keeley look at casualty rate among contemporary hunter gatherer which be we good source of evidence about this way of life have show a rather different conclusion here be a graph that he put together show the percentage of male death due to warfare in a number of forage or hunt and gather society the red bar correspond to the likelihood that a man will die at the hand of another man as oppose to pass away of natural cause in a variety of forage society in the New Guinea Highlands and the Amazon Rainforest and they range from a rate of almost a 60 percent chance that a man will die at the hand of another man to in the case of the Gebusi only a 15 percent chance the tiny little blue bar in the low left hand corner plot the correspond statistic from United States and Europe in the twentieth century and include all the death of both World Wars if the death rate in tribal warfare have prevail during the 20th century there would have be two billion death rather than 100 million also at the millennium scale we can look at the way of life of early civilization such as the one describe in the Bible and in this suppose source of we moral value one can read description of what be expect in warfare such as the follow from number 31 and they war against the Midianites as the Lord command Moses and they slew all the male and Moses say unto they have you save all the woman alive now therefore kill every male among the little one and kill every woman that have known man by lie with he but all the woman child that have not know a man by lie with he keep alive for yourselve in other word kill the man kill the child if you see any virgin then you can keep they alive so that you can rape they you can find four or five passage in the Bible of this ilk also in the Bible one see that the death penalty be the accepted punishment for crime such as homosexuality adultery blasphemy idolatry talk back to you parent laughter and pick up stick on the Sabbath well let click the zoom lens down one order of magnitude and look at the century scale although we do not have statistics for warfare throughout the Middle Ages to modern time we know just from conventional history the evidence be under we nose all along that there have be a reduction in socially sanction form of violence for example any social history will reveal that mutilation and torture be routine form of criminal punishment the kind of infraction today that would give you a fine in that day would result in you tongue be cut out you ear be cut off you be blind a hand be chop off and so on there be numerous ingenious form of sadistic capital punishment burn at the stake disembowel break on the wheel be pull apart by horse and so on the death penalty be a sanction for a long list of non violent crime criticize the king steal a loaf of bread slavery of course be the prefer labor save device and cruelty be a popular form of entertainment perhaps the most vivid example be the practice of cat burn in which a cat be hoist on a stage and lower in a sling into a fire and the spectator shriek in laughter as the cat howl in pain be burn to death what about one on one murder well there there be good statistics because many municipality record the cause of death the criminologist Manuel Eisner scour all of the historical record across Europe for homicide rate in any village hamlet town county that he could find and he supplement they with national datum when nation start keep statistics he plot on a logarithmic scale go from 100 death per 100 000 person per year which be approximately the rate of homicide in the Middle Ages and the figure plummet down to less than one homicide per 100 000 person per year in seven or eight European country then there be a slight uptick in the 1960 the person who say that rock n roll would lead to the decline of moral value actually have a grain of truth to that but there be a decline from at least two order of magnitude in homicide from the Middle Ages to the present and the elbow occur in the early sixteenth century let click down now to the decade scale accord to non governmental organization that keep such statistics since 1945 in Europe and the Americas there have be a steep decline in interstate war in deadly ethnic riot or pogrom and in military coup even in South America Worldwide there be be a steep decline in death in interstate war the yellow bar here show the number of death per war per year from 1950 to the present and as you can see the death rate go down from 65 000 death per conflict per year in the 1950 to less than 2 000 death per conflict per year in this decade as horrific as it be even in the year scale one can see a decline of violence since the end of the Cold War there have be few civil war few genocide indeed a 90 percent reduction since post World War II high and even a reversal of the 1960 uptick in homicide and violent crime this be from the FBI Uniform Crime Statistics you can see that there be a fairly low rate of violence in the 50 and the 60 then it soar upward for several decade and begin a precipitous decline start in the 1990 so that it go back to the level that be last enjoy in 1960 President Clinton if you be here thank you laughter so the question be why be so many person so wrong about something so important I think there be a number of reason one of they be we have good reporting the Associated Press be a good chronicler of war over the surface of the Earth than sixteenth century monk be there be a cognitive illusion we cognitive psychologist know that the easy it be to recall specific instance of something the high the probability that you assign to it Things that we read about in the paper with gory footage burn into memory more than report of a lot more person die in they bed of old age there be dynamics in the opinion and advocacy market no one ever attract observer advocate and donor by say thing just seem to be get good and good laughter there be guilt about we treatment of native people in modern intellectual life and a unwillingness to acknowledge there could be anything good about western culture and of course we change in standard can outpace the change in behavior one of the reason violence go down be that person get sick of the carnage and cruelty in they time that be a process that seem to be continue but if it outstrip behavior by the standard of the day thing always look more barbaric than they would have be by historic standard so today we get exercise and rightly so if a handful of murderer get execute by lethal injection in Texas after a 15 year appeal process we do not consider that a couple of hundred year ago they may have be burn at the stake for criticize the king after a trial that last 10 minute and indeed that that would have be repeat over and over again today we look at capital punishment as evidence of how low we behavior can sink rather than how high we standard have rise well why have violence decline no one really know but I have read four explanation all of which I think have some grain of plausibility the first be maybe Thomas Hobbes get it right he be the one who say that life in a state of nature be solitary poor nasty brutish and short not because he argue human have some primordial thirst for blood or aggressive instinct or territorial imperative but because of the logic of anarchy in a state of anarchy there be a constant temptation to invade you neighbor preemptively before they invade you more recently Thomas Schelling give the analogy of a homeowner who hear a rustling in the basement be a good American he have a pistol in the nightstand pull out he gun and walk down the stair and what do he see but a burglar with a gun in he hand now each one of they be think I do not really want to kill that guy but he be about to kill I maybe I have good shoot he before he shoot I especially since even if he do not want to kill I he be probably worry right now that I might kill he before he kill I and so on Hunter gatherer people explicitly go through this train of thought and will often raid they neighbor out of fear of be raid first now one way of deal with this problem be by deterrence you do not strike first but you have a publicly announce policy that you will retaliate savagely if you be invade the only thing be that it be liable to have its bluff call and therefore can only work if it be credible to make it credible you must avenge all insult and settle all score which lead to the cycle of bloody vendetta life become a episode of the Sopranos Hobbes solution the Leviathan be that if authority for the legitimate use of violence be vest in a single democratic agency a leviathan then such a state can reduce the temptation of attack because any kind of aggression will be punish leave its profitability as zero that would remove the temptation to invade preemptively out of fear of they attack you first it remove the need for a hair trigger for retaliation to make you deterrent threat credible and therefore it would lead to a state of peace Eisner the man who plot the homicide rate that you fail to see in the early slide argue that the timing of the decline of homicide in Europe coincide with the rise of centralized state so that be a bit of a support for the leviathan theory also support it be the fact that we today see eruption of violence in zone of anarchy in fail state collapse empire frontier region mafia street gang and so on the second explanation be that in many time and place there be a widespread sentiment that life be cheap in early time when suffer and early death be common in one own life one have few compunction about inflict they on other and as technology and economic efficiency make life long and more pleasant one put a high value on life in general this be a argument from the political scientist James Payne A third explanation invoke the concept of a nonzero sum game and be work out in the book Nonzero by the journalist Robert Wright Wright point out that in certain circumstance cooperation or non violence can benefit both party in a interaction such as gain in trade when two party trade they surplus and both come out ahead or when two party lay down they arm and split the so call peace dividend that result in they not have to fight the whole time Wright argue that technology have increase the number of positive sum game that human tend to be embroil in by allow the trade of goods service and idea over long distance and among large group of person the result be that other person become more valuable alive than dead and violence decline for selfish reason as Wright put it among the many reason that I think that we should not bomb the Japanese be that they build my mini van laughter the fourth explanation be capture in the title of a book call the Expanding Circle by the philosopher Peter Singer who argue that evolution bequeath human with a sense of empathy a ability to treat other people interest as comparable to one own unfortunately by default we apply it only to a very narrow circle of friend and family person outside that circle be treat as sub human and can be exploit with impunity but over history the circle have expand one can see in historical record it expand from the village to the clan to the tribe to the nation to other race to both sex and in Singer own argument something that we should extend to other sentient species the question be if this have happen what have power that expansion and there be a number of possibility such as increase circle of reciprocity in the sense that Robert Wright argue for the logic of the golden rule the more you think about and interact with other person the more you realize that it be untenable to privilege you interest over theirs at least not if you want they to listen to you you can not say that my interest be special compare to yours anymore than you can say that the particular spot that I be stand on be a unique part of the universe because I happen to be stand on it that very minute it may also be power by cosmopolitanism by history and journalism and memoirs and realistic fiction and travel and literacy which allow you to project yourself into the life of other person that formerly you may have treat as sub human and also to realize the accidental contingency of you own station in life the sense that there but for fortune go I whatever its cause the decline of violence I think have profound implication it should force we to ask not just why be there war but also why be there peace not just what be we do wrong but also what have we be do right because we have be do something right and it sure would be good to find out what it be thank you very much applause Chris Anderson I love that talk I think a lot of person here in the room would say that that expansion of that you be talk about that Peter Singer talk about be also drive by just by technology by great visibility of the other and the sense that the world be therefore get small I mean be that also a grain of truth Steven Pinker very much it would fit both in Wright theory that it allow we to enjoy the benefit of cooperation over large and large circle but also I think it help we imagine what it be like to be someone else I think when you read this horrific torture that be common in the Middle Ages you think how could they possibly have do it how could they have not have empathize with the person that they be disembowel but clearly as far as they be concerned this be just a alien be that do not have feeling akin to they own anything I think that make it easy to imagine trading place with someone else mean that it increase you moral consideration to that other person CA Well Steve I would love every news media owner to hear that talk at some point in the next year I think it be really important thank you so much sp my pleasure
