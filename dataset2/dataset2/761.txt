the big residual be always value for money all the time we be try to get value for money what we do not look for be value for many while we be generate value for money do we care about that four billion person whose income level be less than two dollar a day the so call bottom of the pyramid what be the challenge in get value for money as well as value for many we have describe here in term of the performance and the price if you have money of course you can get the value you can get a Mercedes for a very high price very high performance but if you do not have money what happen well you be to ride a bicycle carry you own weight and also some other weight so that you can earn the bread for the day well poor do not remain poor they become low middle class and if they do so then of course the condition improve and they start ride on scooter but the challenge be again they do not get much value because they can not afford anything more than the scooter the issue be at that price can you give they some extra value a super value in term of they ability to ride in a car to get that dignity to get that safety look practically impossible be not it now this be something that we see on Indian street all the time but many person see the same thing and think thing differently and one of they be here Ratan Tata the great thing about we leader be that should they not only have passion in they belly which practically all of they have they be also very innovative a innovator be one who do not know it can not be do they believe that thing can be do but great leader like Ratan have compassion and what you say Lakshmi be absolutely true it be not just Ratan Tata it be the house of Tatas over time let I confirm what she say yes I go barefoot until I be 12 I struggle to unclear day be a huge issue and when I finish my ssc the eleventh standard I stand eleventh among 125 000 student but I be about to leave the school because my poor mother could not afford school and it be unclear Tata Trust which give I six rupee per month almost a dollar per month for six year that be how I be stand before you so that be the House of Tata applause Innovation compassion and passion they combine all that and it be that compassion which bother they because when he see in fact he tell I about eight or nine year ago how he be drive he own car he drive he own car by the way and he see in the rain a family like the one that I show to you get drench with a infant and then he say well I must give they a car that they can afford one lakh car 2 000 car of course as soon as you say something like this person say it be impossible and that be what be say by Suzuki he say oh probably he be go to build a three wheeler with stepney and you can see the cartoon here well they do not build that they build a proper car Nano and mind you I be six foot half a inch Ratan be tall than I and we have ample space in the front and ample space in the back in this particular car and incredible car and of course nothing succeed like success the cynic then turn around and one after the other they also start say yes we also want to make a car in the Nano segment we will manufacture a car in the Nano Segment how do this great story unfold the making of Nano let I tell you a bit about it for example how we start Ratan just begin with a five engineer team young person in they mid twenty and he say well I will not define the vehicle for you but I will define the cost for you it be one lakh 100 000 rupee and you be to make it within that and he tell they question the unquestionable Stretch the envelope and at a point in time he get so engrossed in the whole challenge that he himself become a member of the team can you believe it I still be tell about this story of that single wiper design in which he participate until midnight he would be think early morning he will be come back with sort of solution but who be the team leader the team leader be Girish Wagh a 34 year old boy in unclear and the Nano team average age be just 27 year and they do innovation in design and beyond break many norm of the standard convention for the first time for example that a two cylinder gas engine be use in a car with a single balancer shaft adhesive be replace the rivet there be a co creation a huge co creation with vendor and supplier all idea on board be welcome 100 vendor be co locate adjacent to the plant and innovative business model for automobile dealership be develop imagine that a fellow who sell cloth for example will be sell Nano I mean it be incredible innovation seek solution for non auto sector it be a open innovation idea from all over be welcome the mechanism of helicopter seat and window be use by the way as well as a dashboard that be inspire by two wheeler the fuel line and lamp be as in two wheeler and the crux of the matter be however get more from less all the time you have be give a envelope you can not cross that envelope which be 100 000 rupee 2 000 dollar and therefore each component have to have a dual functionality and the seat riser for example serve as a mount for the seat as well as a structural part of the functional rigidity half the number of part be contain in Nano in comparison to a typical passenger car the length be small by eight percent by the way but the current entry level car in comparison to that be eight percent less but 21 percent more inside space and what happen be that more from less you can see how much more for how much less when the model t be launch and this be by the way all the figure that be adjust to 2007 dollar price Model T be 19 700 by Ford Volkswagon be 11 333 and British Motor be around 11 000 and Nano be bang 2 000 dollar this be why you start actually a new paradigm shift where the same person who could not dream of sit in a car who be carry they entire family in a scooter start dream of be in a car and that dream be get fulfil this be a photograph of a house and a driver and a car near my own home the driver name be Naran he have buy he own Nano and you can see there be a physical space that have be create for he parking that car along with the owner car but more importantly they have create a space in they mind that yes my chauffeur be go to come in he own car and park it and that be why I call it a transformational innovation it be not just technological it be social innovation that we talk about and that be where lady and gentleman this famous theme of get more from less for more become important I remember talk about this for the first time in Australia about one and a half year ago when they academy honor I with a fellowship and unbelievably in 40 year I be the first Indian to be honor and the title of my talk be therefore Indian innovation from Gandhi to Gandhian engineering and I title this more from less for more and more person as gandhian engineering and gandhian engineering in my judgment be the one which be go to take the world forward be go to make a difference not just for a few but for everyone let I move from mobility in a car to individual mobility for that unfortunate who have lose they leg here be a American citizen and he son have a artificial foot what be its price 20 000 dollar and of course this foot be so design that they can walk only on such perfect pavement or road unfortunately that be not the case in India you can see he walk barefoot on a awkward land sometimes in a marshy land and so on and so forth more importantly they not only walk far to work and not only do they cycle to work but they cycle for work as you can see here and they climb up for they work you have to design a artificial foot for such condition a challenge of course four billion person they income be less then two dollar a day and if you talk about a 20 000 dollar shoe you be talk about 10 000 day of income you just do not have it and therefore you ought to look at alternative and that be how Jaipur Foot be create in India it have a revolutionary prosthetic fitment and delivery system a quick molding and modular component enable custom make on the spot limb fitment you could feel it actually in a hour by the way whereas the equivalent other foot take something like a day as so on outer socket make by use heated high density polyethylene pipe rather than use heated sheet and unique high ankle design and human like look unclear and function and I like to show how it look and how it work music see he jump you can see what stress it must have text any person with a below the knee limb could do this above the limb yes it would be difficult do it hurt no not at all he can run a kilometer in four minute and 30 second one kilometer in four minute and 30 second applause so that be what it be all about and therefore Time take notice of this 28 dollar foot basically applause a incredible story let move on to something else I have be talk about get more from less for more let move to health we have talk about mobility and the rest of it let talk about health what be happen in the area of health you know you have new disease that require new drug and if you look at the drug development 10 year ago and now what have happen 10 year ago it use to cost about a quarter billion today it cost 1 5 billion dollar Time take for move a molecule to marketplace after all the human and animal testing be 10 year now it be 15 year be you get more drug because you be spend more time and more money no I be sorry we use to have 40 now they have come down to 30 so actually we be get less from more for less and less person why less and less person because it be so expensive so very few will be able to basically afford that let we just take a example psoriasis be very dreadful disease of the skin the cost of treatment 20 000 dollar 1 000 dollar antibody injection under the skin by the way and 20 of they Time for development it take around 10 year and 700 million dollar let start in the spirit of more from less and more for more and start put some target for example we do not want 20 000 dollar we do not have it can we do it for 100 dollar time for development not 10 year we be in a hurry five year cost of development 300 million dollar sorry I can not spend more than 10 million dollar look absolutely audacious look absolutely ridiculous you know something this have be achieve in India this target have be achieve in India and how they have be achieve Sir Francis Bacon once say when you wish to achieve result that have not be achieve before it be a unwise fancy to think that they can be achieve by use method that have be use before and therefore the standard process where you develop a molecule put it into mouse into man be not yield that result the billion of dollar that have be spend the Indian cleverness be use its traditional knowledge however scientifically validate it and make that journey from man to mouse to man not molecule to mouse to man you know and that be how this difference have come and you can see this blending of traditional medicine modern medicine modern science I launch a big program unclear csir about nine year ago he be give we not just for Psoriasis for cancer and a whole range of thing change the whole paradigm and you can see this Indian psoriasis breakthrough obtain by this reverse form of unclear by do thing differently you can see before treatment and after treatment this be really get more from less for more and more person because this be all affordable treatment now let I just remind you of what Mahatma Gandhi have say he have say Earth provide enough to satisfy every man need but not every man greed so the message he be give we be you must get more from less and less and less so that you can share it for more and more person not only the current generation but the future generation and he also say I would prize every invention of science make for the benefit for all so he be give you the message that you must have it for more and more person not just a few person and therefore lady and gentleman this be the theme get more from less for more and mind you it be not get just a little more for just a little less it be not about low cost it be about ultra low cost you can not say it be a mere treatment 10 000 dollar but because you be poor I will give it for 9 000 sorry it do not work you have to give it for 100 dollar 200 dollar be it possible it have be make possible by the way for certain other different reason so you be not talk about low cost you be talk about ultra low cost you be not talk about affordability you be talk about extreme affordability because of the four billion person whose income be under two dollar a day you be not talk exclusive innovation you be talk about inclusive innovation and therefore you be not talk about incremental innovation you be talk about disruptive innovation the idea have to be such that you think in completely different term and I would also add it be not only get more from less for more by more and more person the whole world work for it I be very touch when I see a breakthrough the other day you know incubator for infant for example they be not available in Africa they be not available in Indian village and infant die and incubator cost 2 000 dollar and there be a 25 dollar incubator give that performance that have be create and by whom by young student from Standford University on a extreme affordability project that they have basically they heart be in the right place like Ratan Tata it be not just innovation compassion and passion compassion in the heart and passion in the belly that be the new world that we want to create and that be why the message be that of gandhian engineering lady and gentleman I would like to end before time I be also afraid of that 18 minute I have still one and a half to go the message the final message be this India give a great gift to the world what be that in the 20th century we give Gandhi to the world the 21st century gift which be very very important for the whole world whether it be global economic meltdown whether it be climate change any problem that you talk about be gain more from less for more and more not only the current generation for the future generation and that can come only from gandhian engineering so lady and gentleman I be very happy to announce this gift of the 21st century to the world from India gandhian engineering applause Lakshmi Pratury thank you Dr Mashelkar R A Mashelkar thank you very much LP A quick question for you now when you be a young boy in this school what be you thought like what do you think you could become what do you think that drive you be there a vision you have what be it that drive you RAM I will tell you a story that drive I that transform my life I remember I go to a poor school because my mother could not gather the 21 rupee that half a dollar that be require within the stipulate time it be unclear high school but it be a poor school with rich teacher honestly and one of they be unclear who teach we physics one day he take we out into the sun and try to show we how to find the focal length of a convex lens the lens be here the piece of paper be there he move it up and down and there be a bright spot up there and then he say this be the focal length but then he hold it for a little while Lakshmi and then the paper burn when the paper burn for some reason he turn to I and he say Mashelkar like this if you do not diffuse you energy if you focus you energy you can achieve anything in the world that give I a great message focus and you can achieve I say whoa science be so wonderful I have to become a scientist but more importantly focus and you can achieve and that message very frankly be valuable for society today what do that focal length do it have parallel line which be sun ray and the property of parallel line be that they never meet what do that convex lens do it make they meet this be convex lens leadership you know what today leadership be do concave length they divide they far so I learn the lesson of convex lens leadership from that and when I be at National Chemical Laboratory unclear when I be at Council of Scientific Industry Research 40 laboratory when two laboratory be not talk to each other I would unclear and currently I be president of Global Research Alliance 60 000 scientist in nine county right from India to the U S I be try to build a global team which will look at the global grand challenge that the world be face that be the lesson that be the inspirational moment LP thank you very much RAM thank you applause
