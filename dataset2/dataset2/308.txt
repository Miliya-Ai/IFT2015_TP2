this session be on natural wonder and the big conference be on the pursuit of happiness I want to try to combine they all because to I heal be really the ultimate natural wonder you body have a remarkable capacity to begin heal itself and much more quickly than person have once realize if you simply stop do what cause the problem and so really so much of what we do in medicine and life in general be focus on mop up the floor without also turn off the faucet I love do this work because it really give many person new hope and new choice that they do not have before and it allow we to talk about thing that not just diet but that happiness be not we be talk about the pursuit of happiness but when you really look at all the spiritual tradition what Aldous Huxley call the perennial wisdom when you get past the name and form and ritual that really divide person it really about we nature be to be happy we nature be to be peaceful we nature be to be healthy and so it not something happiness be not something you get health be generally not something that you get but rather all of this different practice you know the ancient swamis and rabbis and priest and monk and nun do not develop this technique to just manage stress or low you blood pressure unclog you artery even though it can do all that thing they be powerful tool for transformation for quiet down we mind and body to allow we to experience what it feel like to be happy to be peaceful to be joyful and to realize that it not something that you pursue and get but rather it something that you have already until you disturb it I study yoga for many year with a teacher name Swami Satchidananda and person would say what be you a hindu he would say no I be a undo and it really about identify what cause we to disturb we innate health and happiness and then to allow that natural healing to occur to I that the real natural wonder so within that large context we can talk about diet stress management which be really this spiritual practice moderate exercise smoking cessation support group and community which I will talk more about and some vitamin and supplement and it not a diet you know when most person think about the diet I recommend they think it a really strict diet for reverse disease that what it take but if you be just try to be healthy you have a spectrum of choice and to the degree that you can move in a healthy direction you be go to live long you be go to feel well you be go to lose weight and so on and in we study what we have be able to do be to use very expensive high tech state of the art measure to prove how powerful this very simple and low tech and low cost and in many way ancient intervention can be we first begin by look at heart disease and when I begin do this work 26 or 27 year ago it be think that once you have heart disease it can only get bad and what we find be that instead of get bad and bad in many case it could get good and good and much more quickly than person have once realize this be a representative patient who at the time be 73 totally need to have a bypass decide to do this instead we use quantitative arteriography show the narrow this be one of the artery that feed the heart one of the main artery and you can see the narrowing here a year late it not as clogged normally it go the other direction this minor change in blockage cause a 300 percent improvement in blood flow and use cardiac positron emission tomography or pet scan blue and black be no blood flow orange and white be maximal huge difference can occur without drug without surgery clinically he literally could not walk across the street without get severe chest pain within a month like most person be pain free and within a year climb more than 100 floor a day on a stairmaster this be not unusual and it part of what enable person to maintain this kind of change because it make such a big difference in they quality of life overall if you look at all the artery in all the patient they get bad and bad from one year to five year in the comparison group this be the natural history of heart disease but it really not natural because we find it could get good and good and much more quickly than person have once think we also find that the more person change the good they get it be not a function of how old or how sick they be it be mainly how much they change and the old patient improve as much as the young one I get this as a Christmas card a few year ago from two of the patient in one of we program the young brother be 86 the old one 95 they want to show I how much more flexible they be and the following year they send I this one which I think be kind of funny laughter you just never know and what we find be that 99 percent of the patient start to reverse the progression of they heart disease now I think you know if we just do good science that would change medical practice but that be a little naive it important but not enough because we doctor do what we get pay to do and we get train to do what we get pay to do so if we change insurance then we change medical practice and medical education insurance will cover the bypass it will cover the angioplasty it will not until recently cover diet and lifestyle so we begin through we nonprofit institute training hospital around the country and we find that most person could avoid surgery and not only be it medically effective it be also cost effective and the insurance company find that they begin to save almost 30 000 dollar per patient and Medicare be now in the middle of do a demonstration project where they be pay for 1 800 person to go through the program on the site that we train the fortuneteller say I give smoker a discount because there not as much to tell laughter I like this slide because it a chance to talk about what really motivate person to change and what do not and what do not work be fear of die and that what normally use everybody who smoke know it not good for you and still 30 percent of American smoke 80 percent in some part of the world why do person do it well because it help they get through the day and I will talk more about this but the real epidemic be not just heart disease or obesity or smoke it loneliness and depression as one woman say I have get 20 friend in this package of cigarette and they be always there for I and nobody else be you be go to take away my 20 friend what be you go to give I or they eat when they get depressed or they use alcohol to numb the pain or they work too hard or watch too much tv there be lot of way we have of avoid and numb and bypass pain but the point of all of this be to deal with the cause of the problem and the pain be not the problem it the symptom and tell person they be go to die be too scary to think about or they be go to get emphysema or heart attack be too scary and so they do not want to think about it so they do not the most effective anti smoke ad be this one you will notice the limp cigarette hang out of he mouth and impotence the headline be impotent it not emphysema what be the big selling drug of all time when it be introduce a few year ago Viagra right why because a lot of guy need it it not like you say hey Joe I be have erectile dysfunction how about you and yet look at the number of prescription that be be sell it not so much psychological it vascular and nicotine make you artery constrict so do cocaine so do a high fat diet so do emotional stress so the very behavior that we think of as be so sexy in we culture be the very one that leave so many person feel tired lethargic depressed and impotent and that not much fun but when you change that behavior you brain get more blood you think more clearly you have more energy you heart get more blood in way I have show you you sexual function improve and this thing occur within hour this be a study a high fat meal and within one or two hour blood flow be measurably less and you have all experience this at Thanksgiving when you eat a big fatty meal how do you feel you feel kind of sleepy afterwards on a low fat meal the blood flow do not go down it even go up many of you have kid and you know that a big change in you lifestyle and so person be not afraid to make big change in lifestyle if they be worth it and the paradox be that when you make big change you get big benefit and you feel so much well so quickly for many person that be choice worth make not to live long but to live well I want to talk a little bit about the obesity epidemic because it really be a problem two third of adult be overweight or obese and diabetes in kid and 30 year old have increase 70 percent in the last 10 year it no joke it real and just to show you this this be from the CDC this be not election return this be the percentage of person who be overweight and if you see from 85 to 86 to 87 88 89 90 91 you get a new category 15 to 20 percent 92 93 94 95 96 97 you get a new category 98 99 2000 and 2001 Mississippi more than 25 percent of person be overweight why be this well this be one way to lose weight that work very well but it do not last which be the problem laughter now there no mystery in how you lose weight you either burn more calorie by exercise or you eat few calorie now one way to eat few calorie be to eat less food which be why you can lose weight on any diet if you eat less food or if you restrict entire category of food but the problem be you get hungry so it hard to keep it off the other way be to change the type of food and fat have nine calorie per gram whereas protein and carb only have four so when you eat less fat you eat few calorie without have to eat less food so you can eat the same amount of food but you will be get few calorie because the food be less dense in calorie and it the volume of food that affect satiety rather than the type of food you know I do not like talk about the Atkins diet but I get ask about it every day and so I just think I would spend a few minute on that the myth that you hear about be American have be tell to eat less fat the percent of calorie from fat be down American be fat than ever therefore fat do not make you fat it a half truth actually American be eat more fat than ever and even more carb and so the percentage be low the actual amount be high and so the goal be to reduce both Dr Atkins and I debate each other many time before he die and we agree that American eat too many simple carb the bad carb and this be thing like laughter sugar white flour white rice alcohol and you get a double whammy you get all this calorie that do not fill you up because you have remove the fiber and they get absorb quickly so you blood sugar zoom up you pancreas make insulin to bring it back down which be good but insulin accelerate the conversion of calorie into fat so the goal be not to go to pork rind and bacon and sausages this be not health food but to go from bad carb to what be call good carb and this be thing like whole food or unrefined carb fruit vegetable whole wheat flour brown rice in they natural form be rich in fiber and the fiber fill you up before you get too many calorie and it slow the absorption so you do not get that rapid rise in blood sugar so and you get all the disease protective substance it not just what you exclude from you diet but also what you include that protective just as all carb be not bad for you all fat be not bad for you there be good fat and this be predominantly what be call the omega 3 fatty acid you find this for example in fish oil and the bad fat be thing like trans fatty acid and process food and saturate fat which we find in meat if you do not remember anything else from this talk three gram a day of fish oil can reduce you risk of a heart attack and sudden death by 50 to 80 percent three gram a day they come in one gram capsule more than that just give you extra fat you do not need it also help reduce the risk of the most common cancer like breast prostate and colon cancer now the problem with the Atkins diet everybody know person who have lose weight on it but you can lose weight on amphetamine you know and fen phen I mean there be lot of way of lose weight that be not good for you you want to lose weight in a way that enhance you health rather than the one that harm it and the problem be that it base on this half truth which be that American eat too many simple carb so if you eat few simple carb you be go to lose weight you will lose even more weight if you go to whole food and less fat and you will enhance you health rather than harm it he say I have get some good news while you cholesterol level have remain the same the research finding have change laughter now what happen to you heart when you go on a Atkins diet the red be good at the beginning and a year late this be from a study do in a peer review journal call angiology there more red after a year on a diet like I would recommend there less red less blood flow after a year on a Atkins type diet so yes you can lose weight but you heart be not happy now one of the study fund by the Atkins Center find that 70 percent of the person be constipate 65 percent have bad breath 54 percent have headache this be not a healthy way to eat and so you might start to lose weight and start to attract person towards you but when they get too close it go to be a problem laughter and more seriously there be case report now of 16 year old girl who die after a few week on the Atkins diet of bone disease kidney disease and so on and that how you body excrete waste be through you breath you bowels and you perspiration so when you go on this kind of diet they begin to smell bad so a optimal diet be low in fat low in the bad carb high in the good carb and enough of the good fat and then again it a spectrum when you move in this direction you be go to lose weight you be go to feel well and you be go to gain health now there be ecological reason for eat low on the food chain too whether it the deforestation of the Amazon or make more protein available to the four billion person who live on a dollar a day not to mention whatever ethical concern person have so there be lot of reason for eat this way that go beyond just you health now we be about to publish the first study look at the effect of this program on prostate cancer and in collaboration with Sloane Kettering and with UCSF we take 90 man who have biopsy prove prostate cancer and who have elect for reason unrelated to the study not to have surgery we could randomly divide they into two group and then we could have one group that be a non intervention control group to compare to which we can not do with say breast cancer because everyone get treat what we find be that after a year none of the experimental group patient who make this lifestyle change need treatment whereas six of the control group patient need surgery or radiation when we look at they PSA level which be a marker for prostate cancer they get bad in the control group but they actually get good in the experimental group and this difference be highly significant and then I wonder be there any relationship between how much person change they diet and lifestyle whichever group they be in and the change in PSA and sure enough we find a dose response relationship just like we find in the arterial blockage in we cardiac study and in order for the PSA to go down they have to make pretty big change I then wonder well maybe they be just change they PSA but it not really affect the tumor growth so we take some of they blood serum and send it down to UCLA they add it to a standard line of prostate tumor cell grow in tissue culture and it inhibit the growth seven time more in the experimental group than in the control group 70 versus 9 percent and finally I say I wonder if there any relationship between how much person change and how it inhibit they tumor growth whichever group they happen to be in and this really get I excited because again we find the same pattern the more person change the more it affect the growth of they tumor and finally we do mri and mr spectroscopy scan on some of this patient and the tumor activity be show in red in this patient and you can see clearly it good a year later along with the PSA go down so if it true for prostate cancer it will almost certainly be true for breast cancer as well and whether or not you have conventional treatment in addition if you make this change it may help reduce the risk of recurrence the last thing I want to talk about apropo of the issue of the pursuit of happiness be that study after study have show that person who be lonely and depressed and depression be the other real epidemic in we culture be many time more likely to get sick and die prematurely in part because as we talk about they be more likely to smoke and overeat and drink too much and work too hard and so on but also through mechanism that we do not fully understand person who be lonely and depressed be many time three to five to ten time in some study more likely to get sick and die prematurely and depression be treatable we need to do something about that now on the other hand anything that promote intimacy be heal it can be sexual intimacy I happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy be just different form of the same thing Friendship altruism compassion service all the perennial truth that we talk about that be part of all religion and all culture once you stop try to see the difference this be the thing in we own self interest because they free we from we suffer and from disease and it in a sense the most selfish thing that we can do just take a look at one study this be do by David Spiegel at Stanford he take woman with metastatic breast cancer randomly divide they into two group one group of person just meet for a hour and a half once a week in a support group it be a nurture love environment where they be encourage to let down they emotional defen and talk about how awful it be to have breast cancer with person who understand because they be go through it too they just meet once a week for a year five year late that woman live twice as long and you can see that the person and that be the only difference between the group it be a randomized control study publish in the Lancet other study have show this as well so this simple thing that create intimacy be really heal and even the word heal it come from the root to make whole the word yoga come from the Sanskrit mean union to yoke to bring together and the last slide I want to show you be from I be again this swami that I study with for so many year and I do a combine oncology and cardiology Grand Rounds at the University of Virginia medical school a couple of year ago and at the end of it somebody say hey Swami what the difference between wellness and illness and so he go up on the board and he write the word illness and circle the first letter and then write the word wellness and circle the first two letter to I it just shorthand for what we be talk about that anything that create a sense of connection and community and love be really heal and then we can enjoy we life more fully without get sick in the process thank you applause
