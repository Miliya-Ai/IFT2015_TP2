as a architect you design for the present with a awareness of the past for a future which be essentially unknown the green agenda be probably the most important agenda and issue of the day and I would like to share some experience over the last 40 year we celebrate we fortieth anniversary this year and to explore and to touch on some observation about the nature of sustainability how far you can anticipate what follow from it what be the threat what be the possibility the challenge the opportunity I think that I have say in the past many many year ago before anybody even invent the concept of a green agenda that it be not about fashion it be about survival but what I never say and what I be really go to make the point be that really green be cool I mean all the project which have in some way be inspire by that agenda be about a celebratory lifestyle in a way celebrate the place and the space which determine the quality of life I rarely actually quote anything so I be go to try and find a piece of paper if I can in which somebody at the end of last year venture the thought about what for that individual as a kind of important observer analyst writer a guy call Thomas Friedman who write in the Herald Tribune about 2006 he say I think the most important thing to happen in 2006 be that live and think green hit Main Street we reach a tip point this year where live act design investing and manufacturing green come to be understand by a critical mass of citizen entrepreneur and official as the most patriotic capitalistic geo political and competitive thing they could do hence my motto green be the new red white and blue and I ask myself in a way look back when do that kind of awareness of the planet and its fragility first appear and I think it be July 20 1969 when for the first time man could look back at planet Earth and in a way it be Buckminster Fuller who coin that phrase and before the kind of collapse of the communist system I be privileged to meet a lot of cosmonaut in Space City and other place in Russia and interestingly as I think back they be the first true environmentalist they be fill with a kind of pioneer passion fire about the problem of the Aral Sea and at that period it be in a way a number of thing be happen Buckminster Fuller be the kind of green guru again a word that have not be coin he be a design scientist if you like a poet but he foresee all the thing that be happen now it be another subject it be another conversation you can go back to he writings it be quite extraordinary it be at that time with a awareness fire by Bucky prophecy he concern as a citizen as a kind of citizen of the planet that influence my thinking and what we be do at that time and it be a number of project I select this one because it be 1973 and it be a master plan for one of the Canary Islands and this probably coincide with the time when you have the planet Earth sourcebook and you have the hippie movement and there be some of that quality in this drawing which seek to sum up the recommendation and all the component be there which be now in common parlance in we vocabulary you know 30 odd year late wind energy recycling biomass solar cell and in parallel at that time there be a very kind of exclusive design club person who be really design conscious be inspire by the work of Dieter Rams and the object that he would create for the company call Braun this be go back the mid 50 60 and despite Bucky prophecy that everything would be miniaturize and technology would make a incredible style access to comfort to amenity it be very very difficult to imagine that everything that we see in this image would be very very stylishly package and that and more besides would be in the palm of you hand and I think that that digital revolution now be come to the point where as the virtual world which bring so many person together here finally connect with the physical world there be the reality that that have become humanized so that digital world have all the friendliness all the immediacy the orientation of the analog world probably sum up in a way by the stylish or alternative available here as we generously have gift at lunchtime the unclear which be a further kind of development and again inspire by the incredible sort of sensual feel a very very beautiful object so something which in the 50 60 be very exclusive have now become interestingly quite inclusive and the reference to the ipod as iconic and in a way evocative of performance delivery quite interesting that in the beginning of the year 2007 the Financial Times comment that the Detroit company envy the halo effect that Toyota have gain from the Prius as the hybrid energy conscious vehicle which rival the ipod as a iconic product and I think it be very tempting to in a way seduce ourselves as architect or anybody involve with the design process that the answer to we problem lie with building building be important but they be only a component of a much big picture in other word as I might seek to demonstrate if you could achieve the impossible the equivalent of perpetual motion you could design a carbon free house for example that would be the answer unfortunately it be not the answer it be only the beginning of the problem you can not separate the building out from the infrastructure of cite and the mobility of transit for example if in that Bucky inspire phrase we draw back and we look at planet Earth and we take a kind of typical industrialize society then the energy consume would be split between the building 44 percent transport 34 percent and industry but again that only show part of the picture if you look at the building together with the associate transport in other word the transport of person which be 26 percent then 70 percent of the energy consumption be influence by the way that we cite and infrastructure work together so the problem of sustainability can not be separate from the nature of the city of which the building be a part for example if you take and you make a comparison between a recent kind of city what I will call simplistically a north American city and Detroit be not a bad example it be very car dependent the city go out in annular ring consume more and more green space and more and more road and more and more energy in the transport of person between the city center which again the city center as it become deprive of the living and just become commercial again become dead if you compare Detroit with a city of a northern European example and Munich be not a bad example of that with the great dependence on walk and cycle then a city which be really only twice as dense be only use one tenth of the energy in other word you take this comparable example and the energy leap be enormous so basically if you want to generalize you can demonstrate that as the density increase along the bottom there that the energy consume reduce dramatically of course you can not separate this out from issue like social diversity mass transit the ability to be able to walk a convenient distance the quality of civic space but again you can see Detroit in yellow at the top extraordinary consumption down below Copenhagen and Copenhagen although it be a dense city be not dense compare with the really dense city in the year 2000 a rather interesting thing happen you have for the first time mega city of 5 million or more which be occur in the develop world and now out of typically 46 city 33 of that mega city be in the develop world so you have to ask yourself the environmental impact of for example China or India if you take China and you just take Beijing you can see on that traffic system and the pollution associate with the consumption of energy as the car expand at the price of the bicycle in other word if you put onto the road as be currently happen 1 000 new car every day statistically it be the big booming auto market in the world and the half a billion bicycle serve one and a third billion person be reduce and that urbanization be extraordinary accelerate pace so if we think of the transition in we society of the movement from the land to the city which take 200 year then that same process be happen in 20 year in other word it be accelerate by a factor of 10 and quite interestingly over something like a 60 year period we be see the doubling in life expectancy over that period where the urbanization have treble if I pull back from that global picture and I look at the implication over a similar period of time in term of the technology which as a tool be a tool for designer and I cite we own experience as a company and I just illustrate that by a small selection of project then how do you measure that change of technology how do it affect the design of building and particularly how can it lead to the creation of building which consume less energy create less pollution and be more socially responsible that story in term of build start in the late 60 early 70 the one example I take be a corporate headquarters for a company call Willis and Faber in a small market town in the northeast of England commute distance with London and here the first thing you can see be that this build the roof be a very warm kind of overcoat blanket a kind of insulate garden which be also about the celebration of public space in other word for this community they have this garden in the sky so the humanistic ideal be very very strong in all this work encapsulate perhaps by one of my early sketch here where you can see greenery you can see sunlight you have a connection with nature and nature be part of the generator the driver for this building and symbolically the color of the interior be green and yellow it have facility like swim pool it have flextime it have a social heart a space you have contact with nature now this be 1973 in 2001 this building receive a award and the award be about a celebration for a building which have be in use over a long period of time and the person who have create it come back the project manager the company chairman then and they be say you know the architect Norman be always go on about design for the future and you know it do not seem to cost we any more so we humor he we keep he happy the image at the top what it do not if you look at it in detail really what it be say be you can wire this building this building be wire for change so in 1975 the image there be of typewriter and when the photograph be take it be word processor and what they be say on this occasion be that we competitor have to build new building for the new technology we be fortunate because in a way we build be future proof it anticipate change even though that change be not know round about that design period lead up to this building I do a sketch which we pull out of the archive recently and I be say and I write but we do not have the time and we really do not have the immediate expertise at a technical level in other word we do not have the technology to do what would be really interesting on that building and that would be to create a kind of three dimensional bubble a really interesting overcoat that would naturally ventilate would breathe and would seriously reduce the energy load notwithstanding the fact that the building as a green building be very much a pioneering building and if I fast forward in time what be interesting be that the technology be now available and celebratory the library of the Free University which open last year be a example of that and again the transition from one of the many thousand of sketch and computer image to the reality and a combination of device here the kind of heavy mass concrete of this book stack and the way in which that be enclose by this skin which enable the building to be ventilate to consume dramatically less energy and where it be really work with the force of nature and what be interesting be that this be hugely popular by the person who use it again come back to that thing about the lifestyle and in a way the ecological agenda be very much at one with the spirit so it be not a kind of sacrifice quite the reverse I think it be a great it be a celebration and you can measure the performance in term of energy consumption of that building against a typical library if I show another aspect of that technology then in a completely different context this apartment building in the Alps in Switzerland Prefabricated from the most traditional of material but that material because of the technology the computing ability the ability to prefabricate make high performance component out of timber very much at the cut edge and just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology the ability to plot point in the sky and to transmit to transfer that information now directly into the factory so if you cross the border just across the border a small factory in Germany and here you can see the guy with he computer screen and that point in space be communicate and on the left be the cut machine which then in the factory enable that individual piece to be fabricate and plus or minus very very few millimeter to be slot together on site and then interestingly that build to then be clothe in the old technology which be the kind of hand cut shingle one quarter of a million of they apply by hand as the final finish and again the way in which that work as a building for that of we who can enjoy the space to live and visit there if I make the leap into this new technology then how do we what happen before that I mean you know what be life like before the mobile phone the thing that you take for grant well obviously the building still happen I mean this be a glimpse of the interior of we Hong Kong bank of 1979 which open in 1985 with the ability to be able to reflect sunlight deep into the heart of this space here and in the absence of computer you have to physically model so for example we would put model under a artificial sky for wind tunnel we would literally put they in a wind tunnel and blast air and the many kilometer of cable and so on and the turning point be probably in we term when we have the first computer and that be at the time that we seek to redesign reinvent the airport this be terminal four at Heathrow typical of any terminal big heavy roof block out the sunlight lot of machinery big pipe whir machinery and stanst the green alternative which use natural light be a friendly place you know where you be you can relate to the outside and for a large part of its cycle not need electric light electric light which in turn create more heat which create more cooling load and so on and at that particular point in time this be one of the few solitary computer and that be a little image of the tree of Stansted not go back very far in time 1990 that be we office and if you look very closely you would see that person be draw with pencil and they be push you know big ruler and triangle it be not that long ago 17 year and here we be now I mean major transformation go back in time there be a lady call Valerie Larkin and in 1987 she have all we information on one disk now every week we have the equivalent of 84 million disk which record we archival information on past current and future project that reach 21 kilometer into the sky this be the view you would get if you look down on that but meanwhile as you know wonderful protagonist like Al Gore be note the inexorable rise in temperature set in the context of that interestingly that building which be celebratory and very very relevant to this place we Reichstag project which have a very familiar agenda I be sure as a public place where we seek to in a way through a process of advocacy reinterpret the relationship between society and politician public space and maybe its hidden agenda a energy manifesto something that would be free completely free of fuel as we know it so it would be totally renewable and again the humanistic sketch the translation into the public space but this very very much a part of the ecology but here not have to model it for real obviously the wind tunnel have a place but the ability now with the computer to explore to plan to see how that would work in term of the force of nature natural ventilation to be able to model the chamber below and to look at biomass a combination of biomass aquifer burn vegetable oil a process that quite interestingly be develop in Eastern Germany at the time of its dependence on the Soviet Bloc so really retranslate that technology and develop something which be so clean it be virtually pollution free you can measure it again you can compare how that building in term of its emission in ton of carbon dioxide per year at the time that we take that project over 7 000 ton what it would have be with natural gas and finally with the vegetable oil 450 ton I mean a 94 percent reduction virtually clean we can see the same process at work in term of the Commerce Bank its dependence on natural ventilation the way that you can model that garden the way they spiral around but again very much about the lifestyle the quality something that would be more enjoyable as a place to work and again we can measure the reduction in term of energy consumption there be a evolution here between the project and Swiss re again develop that a little bit far the project in the city in London and this sequence show the buildup of that model but what it show first which I think be quite interesting be that here you see the circle you see the public space around it what be the other way of put the same amount of space on the site if for example you seek to do a building which go right to the edge of the pavement it be the same amount of space and finally you profile this you cut groove into it the groove become the kind of green lung which give view which give light ventilation make the building fresh and you enclose that with something that also be central to its appearance which be a mesh of triangulated structure again in a long connection evocative of some of that work of Buckminster Fuller and the way in which triangulation can increase performance and also give that build its sense of identity and here if we look at a detail of the way that the building open up and breathe into that atrium the way in which now with a computer we can model the force we can see the high pressure the low pressure the way in which the building behave rather like a aircraft wing so it also have the ability all the time regardless of the direction of the wind to be able to make the building fresh and efficient and unlike conventional building the top of the building be celebratory it be a viewing place for person not machinery and the base of the building be again about public space compare it with a typical building what happen if we seek to use such design strategy in term of really large scale think and I be just go to give two image out of a kind of company research project it be be well know that the Dead Sea be die the level be drop rather like the Aral Sea and the Dead Sea be obviously much low than the ocean and sea around it so there have be a project which rescue the Dead Sea by create a pipeline a pipe sometimes above the surface sometimes bury that will redress that and will feed from the Gulf of Aqaba into the Dead Sea and we translation of that use a lot of the thinking build up over the 40 year be to say what if that instead of be just a pipe what if it be a lifeline what if it be the equivalent depend on where you be of the Grand Canal in term of tourist habitation desalination agriculture in other word water be the lifeblood and if you just go back to the previous image and you look at this area of volatility and hostility that a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture could have the affect of bring all that war faction together in a united cause in term of something that would be genuinely green and productive in the wide sense infrastructure at that large scale be also inseparable from communication and whether that communication be the virtual world or it be the physical world then it be absolutely central to society and how do we make more legible in this grow world especially in some of the place that I be talk about China for example which in the next ten year will create 400 new airport now what form do they take how do you make they more friendly at that scale Hong Kong I refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age because you always have a point of reference so what happen when we take that and you expand that further into the Chinese society and what be interesting be that that produce in a way perhaps the ultimate mega building it be physically the large project on the planet at the moment 250 excuse I 50 000 person work 24 hour seven day large by 17 percent than every terminal put together at Heathrow build plus the new un build terminal five and the challenge here be a building that will be green that be compact despite its size and be about the human experience of travel be about friendly be come back to that starting point be very very much about the lifestyle and perhaps this in the end as celebratory space as Hubert be talk over lunch as we sort of engage in conversation talk about this talk about city Hubert be say absolutely correctly this be the new cathedral and in a way one aspect of this conversation be trigger on New Year Eve when I be talk about the Olympic agenda in China in term of its green ambition and aspiration and I be voice the thought that it just cross my mind that New Year Eve a sort of symbolic turning point as we move from 2006 to 2007 that maybe you know the future be the most powerful innovative sort of nation the way in which somebody like Kennedy inspirationally could say we put a man on the moon you know who be go to say that we crack this thing of the dependence on fossil fuel with all that be hold to ransom by rogue regime and so on and that be a concerted platform it be more than one device you know it be renewable and I voice the thought that maybe at the turn of the year I think that the inspiration be more likely to come from that other large country out there the Chinas the Indias the Asian Pacific tiger thank you very much applause
