like the heather on the hillside as they drive we from the Highlands like the ice flow from the Arctic where we land in Newfoundland there be a color to my sorrow there be a name for all this sadness like the ocean in between we I be blue Blue be a river Blue remember blue water run clear Blue like a planet to a spaceman Blue river of my tear fiddle and synthesizer so I come here to the city where the dream burn like a furnace and I dazzle in this dark street like a diamond in a coalface then the cold wind from the island blow a storm cloud across the new moon like the gun smoke above the house in my home Blue be a river Blue remember blue water run clear Blue like a planet to a spaceman Blue river of my tear blue river of my tear fiddle and synthesizer applause
