so I want to talk to you today about AIDS in sub Saharan Africa and this be a pretty well educate audience so I imagine you all know something about AIDS you probably know that roughly 25 million person in Africa be infect with the virus that AIDS be a disease of poverty and that if we can bring Africa out of poverty we would decrease AIDS as well if you know something more you probably know that Uganda to date be the only country in sub Saharan Africa that have have success in combate the epidemic use a campaign that encourage person to abstain be faithful and use condom the ABC campaign they decrease they prevalence in the 1990 from about 15 percent to 6 percent over just a few year if you follow policy you probably know that a few year ago the president pledge 15 billion dollar to fight the epidemic over five year and a lot of that money be go to go to program that try to replicate Uganda and use behavior change to encourage person and decrease the epidemic so today I be go to talk about some thing that you might not know about the epidemic and I be actually also go to challenge some of this thing that you think that you do know to do that I be go to talk about my research as a economist on the epidemic and I be not really go to talk much about the economy I be not go to tell you about export and price but I be go to use tool and idea that be familiar to economist to think about a problem that be more traditionally part of public health and epidemiology and I think in that sense this fit really nicely with this lateral thinking idea here I be really use the tool of one academic discipline to think about problem of another so we think first and foremost AIDS be a policy issue and probably for most person in this room that be how you think about it but this talk be go to be about understand fact about the epidemic it be go to be about think about how it evolve and how person respond to it I think it may seem like I be ignore the policy stuff which be really the most important but I be hope that at the end of this talk you will conclude that we actually can not develop effective policy unless we really understand how the epidemic work and the first thing that I want to talk about the first thing I think we need to understand be how do person respond to the epidemic so AIDS be a sexually transmit infection and it kill you so this mean that in a place with a lot of AIDS there be a really significant cost of sex if you be a uninfected man live in Botswana where the HIV rate be 30 percent if you have one more partner this year a long term partner girlfriend mistress you chance of die in 10 year increase by three percentage point that be a huge effect and so I think that we really feel like then person should have less sex and in fact among gay man in the US we do see that kind of change in the 1980 so if we look in this particularly high risk sample they be be ask do you have more than one unprotected sexual partner in the last two month over a period from 84 to 88 that share drop from about 85 percent to 55 percent it be a huge change in a very short period of time we do not see anything like that in Africa so we do not have quite as good datum but you can see here the share of single man have pre marital sex or married man have extra marital sex and how that change from the early 90 to late 90 and late 90 to early 2000 the epidemic be get bad person be learn more thing about it we see almost no change in sexual behavior this be just tiny decrease two percentage point not significant this seem puzzling but I be go to argue that you should not be surprise by this and that to understand this you need to think about health the way than a economist do as a investment so if you be a software engineer and you be try to think about whether to add some new functionality to you program it be important to think about how much it cost it be also important to think about what the benefit be and one part of that benefit be how much long you think this program be go to be active if version 10 be come out next week there be no point in add more functionality into version nine but you health decision be the same every time you have a carrot instead of a cookie every time you go to the gym instead of go to the movie that be a costly investment in you health but how much you want to invest be go to depend on how much long you expect to live in the future even if you do not make that investment aid be the same kind of thing it be costly to avoid AIDS People really like to have sex but you know it have a benefit in term of future longevity but life expectancy in Africa even without AIDS be really really low 40 or 50 year in a lot of place I think it be possible if we think about that intuition and think about that fact that maybe that explain some of this low behavior change but we really need to test that and a great way to test that be to look across area in Africa and see do person with more life expectancy change they sexual behavior more and the way that I be go to do that be I be go to look across area with different level of malaria so malaria be a disease that kill you it be a disease that kill a lot of adult in Africa in addition to a lot of child and so person who live in area with a lot of malaria be go to have low life expectancy than person who live in area with limited malaria so one way to test to see whether we can explain some of this behavior change by difference in life expectancy be to look and see be there more behavior change in area where there be less malaria so that be what this figure show you this show you in area with low malaria medium malaria high malaria what happen to the number of sexual partner as you increase HIV prevalence if you look at the blue line the area with low level of malaria you can see in that area actually the number of sexual partner be decrease a lot as HIV prevalence go up Areas with medium level of malaria it decrease some it do not decrease as much and area with high level of malaria actually it be increase a little bit although that be not significant this be not just through malaria young woman who live in area with high maternal mortality change they behavior less in response to HIV than young woman who live in area with low maternal mortality there be another risk and they respond less to this exist risk so by itself I think this tell a lot about how person behave it tell we something about why we see limited behavior change in Africa but it also tell we something about policy even if you only care about AIDS in Africa it might still be a good idea to invest in malaria in combate poor indoor air quality in improve maternal mortality rate because if you improve that thing then person be go to have a incentive to avoid AIDS on they own but it also tell we something about one of this fact that we talk about before Education campaign like the one that the president be focus on in he funding may not be enough at least not alone if person have no incentive to avoid AIDS on they own even if they know everything about the disease they still may not change they behavior so the other thing that I think we learn here be that AIDS be not go to fix itself person be not change they behavior enough to decrease the growth in the epidemic so we be go to need to think about policy and what kind of policy might be effective and a great way to learn about policy be to look at what work in the past the reason that we know that the ABC campaign be effective in Uganda be we have good datum on prevalence over time in Uganda we see the prevalence go down we know they have this campaign that be how we learn about what work it be not the only place we have any intervention other place have try thing so why do not we look at that place and see what happen to they prevalence unfortunately there be almost no good datum on HIV prevalence in the general population in Africa until about 2003 so if I ask you why do not you go and find I the prevalence in Burkina Faso in 1991 you get on Google you Google and you find actually the only person test in Burkina Faso in 1991 be std patient and pregnant woman which be not a terribly representative group of person then if you poke a little more you look a little more at what be go on you would find that actually that be a pretty good year because in some year the only person test be iv drug user but even bad some year it be only iv drug user some year it be only pregnant woman we have no way to figure out what happen over time we have no consistent testing now in the last few year we actually have do some good testing in Kenya in Zambia and a bunch of country there be be test in random sample of the population but this leave we with a big gap in we knowledge so I can tell you what the prevalence be in Kenya in 2003 but I can not tell you anything about 1993 or 1983 so this be a problem for policy it be a problem for my research and I start think about how else might we figure out what the prevalence of HIV be in Africa in the past and I think that the answer be we can look at mortality datum and we can use mortality datum to figure out what the prevalence be in the past to do this we be go to have to rely on the fact that AIDS be a very specific kind of disease it kill person in the prime of they life not a lot of other disease have that profile and you can see here this be a graph of death rate by age in Botswana and Egypt Botswana be a place with a lot of AIDS Egypt be a place without a lot of AIDS and you see they have pretty similar death rate among young kid and old person that suggest it be pretty similar level of development but in this middle region between 20 and 45 the death rate in Botswana be much much much high than in Egypt but since there be very few other disease that kill person we can really attribute that mortality to HIV but because person who die this year of AIDS get it a few year ago we can use this datum on mortality to figure out what HIV prevalence be in the past so it turn out if you use this technique actually you estimate of prevalence be very close to what we get from test random sample in the population but they be very very different than what UNAIDS tell we the prevalence be so this be a graph of prevalence estimate by UNAIDS and prevalence base on the mortality datum for the year in the late 1990 in nine country in Africa you can see almost without exception the UNAIDS estimate be much high than the mortality base estimate UNAIDS tell we that the HIV rate in Zambia be 20 percent and mortality estimate suggest it be only about 5 percent and this be not trivial difference in mortality rate so this be another way to see this you can see that for the prevalence to be as high as UNAIDS say we have to really see 60 death per 10 000 rather than 20 death per 10 000 in this age group I be go to talk a little bit in a minute about how we can use this kind of information to learn something that be go to help we think about the world but this also tell we that one of this fact that I mention in the beginning may not be quite right if you think that 25 million person be infect if you think that the UNAIDS number be much too high maybe that be more like 10 or 15 million it do not mean that AIDS be not a problem it be a gigantic problem but it do suggest that that number might be a little big what I really want to do be I want to use this new datum to try to figure out what make the HIV epidemic grow fast or slow and I say in the beginning I be not go to tell you about export when I start work on this project I be not think at all about economics but eventually it kind of suck you back in so I be go to talk about export and price and I want to talk about the relationship between economic activity in particular export volume and HIV infection so obviously as a economist I be deeply familiar with the fact that development that openness to trade be really good for develop country it be good for improve person life but openness and inter connectedness it come with a cost when we think about disease I do not think this should be a surprise on Wednesday I learn from Laurie Garrett that I be definitely go to get the bird flu and I would not be at all worried about that if we never have any contact with Asia and HIV be actually particularly closely link to transit the epidemic be introduce to the US by actually one male steward on a airline flight who get the disease in Africa and bring it back and that be the genesis of the entire epidemic in the US in Africa epidemiologist have note for a long time that truck driver and migrant be more likely to be infect than other person area with a lot of economic activity with a lot of road with a lot of urbanization that area have high prevalence than other but that actually do not mean at all that if we give person more export more trade that that would increase prevalence by use this new datum use this information about prevalence over time we can actually test that and so it seem to be fortunately I think it seem to be the case that this thing be positively relate more export mean more AIDS and that effect be really big so the datum that I have suggest that if you double export volume it will lead to a quadrupling of new HIV infection so this have important implication both for forecasting and for policy from a forecasting perspective if we know where trade be likely to change for example because of the African Growth and Opportunities Act or other policy that encourage trade we can actually think about which area be likely to be heavily infect with HIV and we can go and we can try to have pre emptive preventive measure there likewise as we be develop policy to try to encourage export if we know there be this externality this extra thing that be go to happen as we increase export we can think about what the right kind of policy be but it also tell we something about one of this thing that we think that we know even though it be the case that poverty be link to AIDS in the sense that Africa be poor and they have a lot of AIDS it be not necessarily the case that improve poverty at least in the short run that improve export and improve development it be not necessarily the case that that be go to lead to a decline in HIV prevalence so throughout this talk I have mention a few time the special case of Uganda and the fact that it be the only country in sub Saharan Africa with successful prevention it be be widely herald it be be replicate in Kenya and Tanzania and South Africa and many other place but now I want to actually also question that because it be true that there be a decline in prevalence in Uganda in the 1990 it be true that they have a education campaign but there be actually something else that happen in Uganda in this period there be a big decline in coffee price coffee be Uganda major export they export go down a lot in the early 1990 and actually that decline line up really really closely with this decline in new HIV infection so you can see that both of this series the black line be export value the red line be new HIV infection you can see they be both increase start about 1987 they be both go down a lot and then actually they track each other a little bit on the increase later in the decade so if you combine the intuition in this figure with some of the datum that I talk about before it suggest that somewhere between 25 percent and 50 percent of the decline in prevalence in Uganda actually would have happen even without any education campaign but that be enormously important for policy we be spend so much money to try to replicate this campaign and if it be only 50 percent as effective as we think that it be then there be all sort of other thing maybe we should be spend we money on instead try to change transmission rate by treat other sexually transmit disease try to change they by engage in male circumcision there be ton of other thing that we should think about do and maybe this tell we that we should be think more about that thing I hope that in the last 16 minute I have tell you something that you do not know about AIDS and I hope that I have get you question a little bit some of the thing that you do know and I hope that I have convince you maybe that it be important to understand thing about the epidemic in order to think about policy but more than anything you know I be a academic and when I leave here I be go to go back and sit in my tiny office and my computer and my datum and the thing that be most exciting about that be every time I think about research there be more question there be more thing that I think that I want to do and what be really really great about be here be I be sure that the question that you guy have be very very different than the question that I think up myself and I can not wait to hear about what they be so thank you very much
