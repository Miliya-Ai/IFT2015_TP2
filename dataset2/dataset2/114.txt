what I want to talk to you about today be virtual world digital globe the 3 d web the Metaverse what do this all mean for we what it mean be the web be go to become a exciting place again it be go to become super exciting as we transform to this highly immersive and interactive world with graphic compute power low latency this type of application and possibility be go to stream rich datum into you life so the virtual Earth initiative and other type of this initiative be all about extend we current search metaphor when you think about it we be so constrain by browsing the web remember url save favorite as we move to search we rely on the relevance ranking the web match the index crawl but we want to use we brain we want to navigate explore discover information in order to do that we have to put you as a user back in the driver seat we need cooperation between you and the computing network and the computer so what good way to put you back in the driver seat than to put you in the real world that you interact in every day why not leverage the learning that you have be learn you entire life so virtual Earth be about start off create the first digital representation comprehensive of the entire world what we want to do be mix in all type of data tag it attribute it Metadata get the community to add local depth global perspective local knowledge so when you think about this problem what a enormous undertaking where do you begin well we collect datum from satellite from airplane from ground vehicle from person this process be a engineering problem a mechanical problem a logistical problem a operational problem here be a example of we aerial camera this be panchromatic it be actually four color cone in addition it be multi spectral we collect four gigabit per second of datum if you can imagine that kind of datum stream come down that be equivalent to a constellation of 12 satellite at high re capacity we fly this airplane at 5 000 foot in the air you can see the camera on the front we collect multiple viewpoint vantage point angle texture we bring all that datum back in we sit here you know think about the ground vehicle the human scale what do you see in person we need to capture that up close to establish that what it be like type experience I bet many of you have see the Apple commercial kind of poke at the pc for they brilliance and simplicity so a little unknown secret be do you see the one with the guy he be get the web cam the poor pc guy they be duct tape he head they be just wrap it on he well a little unknown secret be he brother actually work on the virtual Earth team laughter so they have get a little bit of a sibling rivalry thing go on here but let I tell you it do not affect he day job we think a lot of good can come from this technology this be after Katrina we be the first commercial fleet of airplane to be clear into the disaster impact zone we fly the area we image it we send in person we take picture of interior disaster area we help with the first responder the search and rescue often the first time anyone see what happen to they house be on virtual Earth we make it all freely available on the web just to it be obviously we chance of help out with the cause when we think about how all this come together it be all about software algorithm and math you know we capture this imagery but to build the 3 d model we need to do geo positioning we need to do geo register of the image we have to bundle adjust they find tie point extract geometry from the image this process be a very calculated process in fact it be always do manual Hollywood would spend million of dollar to do a small urban corridor for a movie because they would have to do it manually they have drive the street with laser call LIDAR they have collect information with photo they have manually build each building we do this all through software algorithm and math a highly automate pipeline create this city we take a decimal point off what it cost to build this city and that be how we be go to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream we think about the user interface what do it mean to look at it from multiple perspective a ortho view a nadir view how do you keep the precision of the fidelity of the imagery while maintain the fluidity of the model I will wrap up by show you the this be a brand new peek I have not really show into the lab area of virtual Earth what we be do be person like this a lot this bird eye imagery we work with it be this high resolution datum but what we have find be they like the fluidity of the 3 d model a child can navigate with a Xbox controller or a game controller so here what we be try to do be we bring the picture and project it into the 3 d model space you can see all type of resolution from here I can slowly pan the image over I can get the next image I can blend and transition by do this I do not lose the original detail in fact I might be record history the freshness the capacity I can turn this image I can look at it from multiple viewpoint and angle what we be try to do be build a virtual world we hope that we can make compute a user model you be familiar with and really derive insight from you from all different direction I thank you very much for you time applause
