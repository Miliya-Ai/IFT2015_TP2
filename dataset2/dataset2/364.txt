I have request slide kind of adamantly up till the pretty much last few day but be deny access to a slide projector laughter I actually find they a lot more emotional laughter and personal and the neat thing about a slide projector be you can actually focus the work unlike PowerPoint and some other program now I agree that you have to yeah there be certain concession and you know if you use a slide projector you be not able to have the bad type swing in from the back or the side or up or down but maybe that be a o k trade off to trade that off for a focus laughter it be a thought just a thought and there be something nice about slide get stuck and the thing you really hope for be occasionally they burn up which we will not see tonight so with that let get the first slide up here this as many of you have probably guess be a recently empty beer can in Portugal laughter this I have just arrive in Barcelona for the first time and I think you know fly all night I look up and I think wow how clean you come into this major airport and they simply have a b I mean how nice be that everything get simple in design and here be this mega airport and God I just I take a picture I think God that be the cool thing I have ever see at a airport till a couple month later I go back to the same airport same plane I think and look up and it say c laughter it be only then that I realize it be simply a gate that I be come into laughter I be a big believer in the emotion of design and the message that be send before somebody begin to read before they get the rest of the information what be the emotional response they get to the product to the story to the painting whatever it be that area of design interest I the most and I think this for I be a real clear very simplified version of what I be talk about this be a couple of garage door paint identical situate next to each other so here be the first door you know you get the message you know it be pretty clear take a look at the second door and see if there be any different message o k which one would you park in front of laughter same color same message same word the only thing that be different be the expression that the individual door owner here put into the piece and again which be the psycho killer here laughter yet it do not say that it do not need to say that I would probably park in front of the other one I be sure a lot of you be aware that graphic design have get a lot simple in the last five year or so it be get so simple that it be already start to kind of come back the other way again and get a little more expressive but I be in Milan and see this street sign and be very happy to see that apparently this idea of minimalism have even be translate by the graffiti artist laughter and this graffiti artist have come along make this sign a little bit well and then move on laughter he do not overpower it like they have a tendency to do laughter this be for a book by Metropolis I take some photo and this be a billboard in Florida and either they have not pay they rent or they do not want to pay they rent again on the sign and the billboard person be too cheap to tear the whole sign down so they just tear out section of it and I would argue that it be possibly more effective than the original billboard in term of get you attention get you to look over that way and hopefully you do not stop and buy that awful pecan thing Stuckey this be from my second book the first book be call the end of print and it be do along with a film work with William Burroughs and the end of print be now in its fifth printing laughter when I first contact William Burroughs about be part of it he say no he say he do not believe it be the end of print and I say well that be fine I just would love to have you input on this film and this book and he finally agree to it and at the end of the film he say in this great voice that I can not mimic but I will kind of try but not really he say I remember attend a exhibition call photography the end of painting and then he say and of course it be not at all so apparently when photography be perfect there be person go around say that be it you have just ruin painting person be just go to take picture now and of course that be not the case so this be from 2nd Sight a book I do on intuition I think it be not the only ingredient in design but possibly the most important it be something everybody have it be not a matter of teach it in fact most of the school tend to discount intuition as a ingredient of you working process because they can not quantify it it be very hard to teach person the four step to intuitive design but we can teach you the four step to a nice business card or a newsletter so it tend to get discount this be a quote from Albert Einstein who say the intellect have little to do on the road to discovery there come a leap in consciousness call it intuition or what you will and the solution just come to you and you do not know from where or why so it be kind of like when somebody say who do that song and the more you try to think about it the far the answer get from you and the minute you stop think about it you intuition give you that answer in a sense I like this for a couple of reason if you have have any design course they would teach you you can not read this I think you eventually can and more importantly I think it be true do not mistake legibility for communication just because something legible do not mean it communicate more importantly it do not mean it communicate the right thing so what be the message send before somebody actually get into the material and I think that be sometimes a overlook area this be work with Marshall McLuhan I stay and work with he wife and son Eric and we come up with close to 600 quote from Marshall that be just amazing in term of be ahead of the time predict so much of what have happen in the advertising television media world and so this book be call Probes it be another word for quote and it be a lot of they be never have never be publish before and basically I have interpret the different quote so this be the contents page originally when I get do it be 540 page and then the publisher Gingko Press end up cut it down considerably it be just under 400 page now but I decide I like this contents page I like the way it look so I keep it laughter it now have no relevance to the book whatsoever but it be a nice spread I think in there laughter so a couple spread from the book here McLuhan say the new media be not bridge between Man and Nature they be Nature the invention of printing do away with anonymity foster idea of literary fame and the habit of consider intellectual effort as private property which have never be do before print when new technology impose themselves on society long habituate to old technology anxiety of all kind result while person be engage in create a totally different world they always form vivid image of the precede world I hate this stuff it be hard to read laughter applause person in the electronic age have no possible environment except the globe and no possible occupation except information gathering that be it that be all he see as the option and not too far off so this be a project for nine Inch Nails and I only show it because it seem like it get all this relevancy all of a sudden and it be do right after 9 11 and I have recently discover a bomb shelter in the backyard of a house I have buy in LA that the real estate person have not point out laughter there be some bomb shelter build apparently in the 60 Cuban missile crisis and I ask the real estate guy what it be as we be walk by and he go it be something to do with the sewage system I be o k that be fine I finally go down there and it be this old rust circular thing and two bed and very kind of creepy and weird and also surprisingly it be do in kind of a cheap metal and it have completely rust through and water everywhere and spider and I think you know what be they think you would think maybe cement possibly or something but anyway I use this for a cover for the Nine Inch Nails DVD and I have also now fix the bomb shelter with duct tape and it be ready I think I be ready so this be a experiment really for a client quicksilver where we be take what be a six shot sequence and try to use print as a medium to get person to the web so this be a six shot sequence I have take one shot I crop it a few different way and then the tiny line of copy say if you want to see this entire sequence how this whole ride be go to the website and my guess be that a lot of the surf kid do go to the site to get this entire picture get no way of track it so I could be totally wrong laughter I do not have the site it be just the piece itself this be a group in New York call the coalition for a smoke free Environment ask I to do this poster they be wild post around New York City you can not really well you can not see it at all but the second line be really the more kind of payoff in a sense it say if the cigarette company can lie then so can we but laughter applause but I do this be literally wild post all over New York one night and there be definitely some head turn you know person smoke and huh laughter and it be purposely do to look fairly serious it be not some you know weird grunge type or something it look like they might be real anyway poster for Atlantic Center for the Arts a school in Florida this amaze I this be a product I just find out I be in the Caribbean at Christmas and I be just blow away that in this day and age they will still sell not that they will sell that there be feel a need for person to lighten the color of they skin this be either a old product with new packaging or a brand new package and I just think yikes how be that still happen I do a lot of workshop all over the world really and this particular assignment be to come up with new symbol for the restroom door laughter I feel this be one of the more successful solution the student actually cut they up and put they up around bar and restaurant that night and I just always have this vision of this elderly couple go to use the restroom laughter I do some work for Microsoft a few year back it be a worldwide branding campaign and it be interesting to I my background be in sociology I have no design training and sometimes person say well that explain it but it be a very interesting experiment because there be no product that I have to sell it be simply the image of Microsoft they be try to improve they think some person do not like they laughter I find out that be very true work on this campaign worldwide and we goal be to try to humanize they a bit and what I do be add type and person to the ad which the previous campaign have not have and nobody remember they and nobody reference they and we be try to say that hey some of this guy that work there be actually ok some of they actually have friend and family and they be not all awful person and the umbrella campaign be thank God it be Monday so we try to take this what be perceive as a negative they over competitiveness they you know long work hour and turn it into a positive and not run from it you know thank God it be Monday I get to go back to that little cubicle that fake gray wall and hear everybody else conversation f or 10 hour and then go home but anyway this be one of the ad I be most pleased with because they be all elaborately art direct and this one I think actually feel like the girl be look at the computer it say wonder around and then it be a piece of the software and this be how the ad run around the world in Germany they make one small change without check with I nor do they have to because it be do through agency but see if you can tell the difference this be how the ad run throughout the world Germany make one slight change in the ad laughter now there be kind of two issue here if you be go to put a kid in the ad pick one that look alive laughter I just have a feeling this kid be there for a week you know he be just really hope that boot up and you know laughter and then as the agency explain to I they say look we do not have little green person in we country why would we put little green person in we ad for instance so I understand they logic I totally disagree with it I think it be a very small minded approach the world be certainly much more global and I certainly think the person of Germany could have handle a little black girl sit in front of a computer though we will never know this be some work from Ray Gun and the point of this magazine be to read the article listen to the music and try to interpret it there be no grid there be no system there be nothing set up in advance this be a opener for Brian Eno and it be just kind of my personal interpretation of the music this be rockstar talk about teacher they have lust after in school there be a lot of great writing in Ray Gun and I be fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sit on some book laughter article on Bryan Ferry just really boring article so I set the whole article in dingbat laughter you could you could highlight it you could make it Helvetica or something it be the actual article I suppose you could eventually decode it but it be really not very well write it really would not be worthwhile laughter have do a lot of magazine I be very curious how big magazine handle big story and I be very curious to see how Time and Newsweek would handle 9 11 and I be basically pretty disappointed to see that they have choose to show the photo we have already see a million time which be basically the moment of impact and person magazine I think get probably the good shot it be kind of horsey type but the texture the second plane not quite hit there be something more enticing if that be the right it be not the right word but in this cover than Time or Newsweek but when I get into this magazine there be something kind of disturbing and this continue on the left we see person die we see person run for they life and on the right we learn that there be a new way to support you breast the coveted right hand page be not give up to the whole issue look at the image of this lady who know what she be go through and the copy say he know just how to give I goosebump yeah he jump out of building it be unfortunately this one work kind of as a spread and this continue through the entire magazine it do not let up this say one clean fit all there be a lot of orphan make this day and here be a dead body be bring out it just seem to I possibly even a blank page would have be more appropriate and this one I think be possibly the bad two lady both face the same way both wear jeans one who know what she be go through the other one be worried about model behavior and milk and I give a talk in New York a couple month after this and afterwards somebody come up to I and they say that they actually email I and they say that they appreciate the talk and when they get back to they car they find a note on they car that make they think maybe New York be get back to be New York again after this event it have be a few month this be what they find on they car laughter there be very few time you would be happy to find this on you car but it do seem to indicate that we be come back this be my desktop somebody tell I today there be this thing call folder but I do not know what they be this be my note for the talk there might be a correlation here we be wrap up this I see on the plane fly in for hot new product I be not sure this be a improvement or a good idea because like if you do not spend quite enough time in front of you computer you can now get a plate in the keyboard so there be no more fake it that you do not really sit at you desk all day and eat and work anyway now there be a plate and it would be really really convenient to get a piece of pizza then type a little bit then I be just not sure this be improvement if you ever doubt the power of graphic design this be a very generic sign that literally say vote for Hitler it say nothing else and this to I be a extreme case of the power of emotion of graphic design even though in fact be a very generic poster at the time what be next what be next be go to be person as we get more technically drive the importance of person become more than it be ever be before you have to utilize who you be in you work nobody else can do that nobody else can pull from you background from you parent you upbringing you whole life experience if you allow that to happen it be really the only way you can do some unique work and you be go to enjoy the work a lot more as well this be I like find art hand lettering come back in a big way and I think this be a great example of both this lady advertising for she lose pit bull it be friendly she be underline friendly that be probably why she call it Hercules or Hercles she can not spell laughter but more importantly she be willing to give you 20 buck to go find this lose pit bull and I be think yeah right I will go look for a lose pit bill for 20 buck I have vision of person go down alleyway yell out for Hercles and you get charge by this thing and you go oh please be Hercles please be the friendly one laughter I be sure she never find the dog because I take the sign laughter but I be ask to give a talk at a conference in Sacramento a few year back and the theme be courage and they ask I to talk about how courageous it be to be a graphic designer and I remember see this photograph of my father who be a test pilot and he tell I that when you sign up to become a test pilot they tell you that there be a 40 to 50 percent chance of death on the job that be pretty high for most occupation laughter but you know the government would make a plane they would say go see if that one fly would you some of they do some of they do not and I start think about some of this decision I have to make between like serif versus san serif laughter and for the most part they be not real life threaten why not experiment why not have some fun why not put some of yourself into the work and when I be teach I use to always ask the student what be the definition of a good job and as teacher after you get all the answer you like to give they the correct answer and the good one I have hear I be sure some of you have hear this the definition of a good job be if you could afford to if money be not a issue would you be do that same work and if you would you have get a great job and if you would not what the heck be you do you be go to be dead a really long time thank you very much
