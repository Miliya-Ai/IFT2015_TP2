well first of all let I thank Emeka as a matter of fact TED Global for put this conference together this conference be go to rank as the most important in the beginning of the 21st century think African government will put together a conference like this you think the a u will put together a conference like this even before they do that they will ask for foreign aid I would also like to pay homage and honor to the TED fellow June Arunga James Shikwati Andrew and the other TED fellow I call they the Cheetah Generation the Cheetah Generation be a new breed of African who brook no nonsense about corruption they understand what accountability and democracy be they be not go to wait for government to do thing for they that be the Cheetah Generation and Africa salvation rest on the back of this Cheetahs in contrast of course we have the Hippo generation laughter the Hippo Generation be the ruling elite they be stick in they intellectual patch complain about colonialism and imperialism they would not move one foot if you ask they to reform the economy they be not go to reform it because they benefit from the rotten status quo now there be a lot of African who be very angry angry at the condition of Africa now we be talk about a continent that be not poor it be rich in mineral resource natural mineral resource but the mineral wealth of Africa be not be utilize to lift its person out of poverty that be what make a lot of African very angry and in a way Africa be more than a tragedy in more way than one there be another endure tragedy and that tragedy be that there be so many person so many government so many organization who want to help the person in Africa they do not understand now we be not say do not help Africa Helping Africa be noble but help Africa have be turn into a theater of the absurd it be like the blind lead the clueless laughter there be certain thing that we need to recognize Africa beg bowl leak do you know that 40 percent of the wealth create in Africa be not invest here in Africa it be take out of Africa that be what the World Bank say look at Africa beg bowl it leak horribly there be person who think that we should pour more money more aid into this bowl which leak what be the leakage corruption alone cost Africa 148 billion dollar a year yes put that aside capital flight out of Africa 80 billion a year put that aside let take food import every year Africa spend 20 billion dollar to import food just add that up all this leakage that be far more than the 50 billion Tony Blair want to raise for Africa now back in the 1960 Africa not only feed itself it also export food not anymore we know that something have go fundamentally wrong you know it I know it but let not waste we time talk about this mistake because we will spend all day here let move on and flip over to the next chapter and that be what this conference be all about the next chapter the next chapter begin with first of all ask ourselves this fundamental question whom do we want to help in Africa there be the person and then there be the government or leader now the previous speaker before I Idris Mohammed indicate that we have have abysmal leadership in Africa that characterization in my view be even more charitable laughter I belong to a internet discussion forum a African internet discussion forum and I ask they I say since 1960 we have have exactly 204 African head of state since 1960 and I ask they to name I just 20 good leader just 20 good leader you may want to take this leadership challenge yourself I ask they to name I just 20 everybody mention Nelson Mandela of course Kwame Nkrumah Nyerere Kenyatta somebody mention Idi Amin laughter I let that pass laughter my point be they could not go beyond 15 even if they have be able to name I 20 what do that tell you 20 out of 204 means that the vast majority of the African leader fail they person and if you look at they the slate of the post colonial leader a assortment of military fufu head Swiss bank socialist crocodile liberator vampire elite quack revolutionary applause now this leadership be a far cry from the traditional leader that African have know for century the second false premise that we make when we be try to help Africa be that sometimes we think that there be something call a government in Africa that care about its person serve the interest of the person and represent the person there be one particular quote a Lesotho chief once say that here in Lesotho we have get two problem rat and the government laughter what you and I understand as a government do not exist in many African country in fact what we call we government be vampire state vampire because they suck the economic vitality out of they person Government be the problem in Africa A vampire state be the government applause which have be hijack by a phalanx of bandit and crook who use the instrument of state power to enrich themselves they crony and tribesman and exclude everybody else the rich person in Africa be head of state and minister and quite often the chief bandit be the head of state himself where do they get they money by create wealth no by rake it off the back of they suffer person that be not wealth creation it be wealth redistribution the third fundamental issue that we have to recognize be that if we want to help the African person we must know where the African person be take any African economy a African economy can be break up into three sector there be the modern sector there be the informal sector and the traditional sector the modern sector be the abode of the elite it be the seat of government in many African country the modern sector be lose it be dysfunctional it be a meretricious fandango of import system which the elite themselves do not understand that be the source of many of Africa problem where the struggle for political power emanate and then spill over onto the informal and the traditional sector claim innocent life now the modern sector of course be where a lot of the development aid and resource go into more than 80 percent of Ivory Coast development go into the modern sector the other sector the informal and the traditional sector be where you find the majority of the African person the real person in Africa that be where you find they now obviously it make common sense that if you want to help the person you go where the person be but that be not what we do as a matter of fact we neglect the informal and the traditional sector now traditional sector be where Africa produce its agriculture which be one of the reason why Africa can not feed itself and that be why it must import food all right you can not develop Africa by ignore the informal and the traditional sector and you can not develop the informal and the traditional sector without a operational understanding of how this two sector work this two sector let I describe to you have they own indigenous institution first one be the political system traditionally African hate government they hate tyranny if you look into they traditional system African organize they state in two type the first one belong to that ethnic society who believe that the state be necessarily tyrannous so they do not want to have anything to do with any centralized authority this society be the Ibo the Somali the Kikuyus for example they have no chief the other ethnic group which do have chief make sure that they surround the chief with council upon council upon council to prevent they from abuse they power in ashanti tradition for example the chief can not make any decision without the concurrence of the council of elder without the council the chief can not pass any law and if the chief do not govern accord to the will of the person he will be remove if not the person will abandon the chief go somewhere else and set up a new settlement and even if you look in ancient African empire they be all organize around one particular principle the confederacy principle which be characterize by a great deal of devolution of authority decentralization of power now this be what I have describe to you this be part of Africa indigenous political heritage now compare that to the modern system the ruling elite establish on Africa it be a total far cry in the economic system in traditional Africa the means of production be privately own it be own by extend family you see in the West the basic economic and social unit be the individual the American will say I be because I be and I can damn well do anything I want anytime the accent be on the i in Africa the African say I be because we be the we connote community the extended family system the extend family system pool its resource together they own farm they decide what to do what to produce they do not take any order from they chief they decide what to do and when they produce they crop they sell the surplus on marketplace when they make a profit it be theirs to keep not for the chief to sequester it from they so in a nutshell what we have in traditional Africa be a free market system there be market in Africa before the colonialist step foot on the continent Timbuktu be one great big market town Kano Salaga they be all there even if you go to West Africa you notice that market activity in West Africa have always be dominate by woman so it be quite appropriate that this section be call a marketplace the market be not alien to Africa what African practice be a different form of capitalism but then after independence all of a sudden market capitalism become a western institution and the leader say African be ready for socialism nonsense and even then what kind of socialism do they practice the socialism that they practice be a peculiar form of Swiss bank socialism which allow the head of state and the minister to rape and plunder Africa treasury for deposit in Switzerland that be not the kind of system African have know for century what do we do now go back to Africa indigenous institution and this be where we charge the Cheetahs to go into the informal sector the traditional sector that be where you find the African person and I would like to show you a quick little video about the informal sector about the boat building that I myself try to mobilize African in the Diaspora to invest in could you please show that the man be go fishing in this small boat yes it be a enterprise this be by a local Ghanaian entrepreneur use he own capital he be get no assistance from the government and he be build a second big boat a big boat will mean more fish will be catch and land it mean that he will be able to employ more Ghanaian it also mean that he will be able to generate wealth and then it will have what economist call external effect on a local economy all that you need to do all that the elite need to do be to move this operation into something that be enclose so that the operation can be make more efficient now it be not just this informal sector there be also traditional medicine 80 percent of African still rely on traditional medicine the modern healthcare sector have totally collapse now this be a area I mean there be a treasure trove of wealth in the traditional medicine area this be where we need to mobilize African in the Diaspora especially to invest in this we also need to mobilize African in the Diaspora not only to go into the traditional sector but to go into agriculture and also to instigate change from within we be able to mobilize Ghanaian in the Diaspora to instigate change in Ghana and bring about democracy in Ghana and I know that with the Cheetahs we can take Africa back one village at a time thank you very much applause
