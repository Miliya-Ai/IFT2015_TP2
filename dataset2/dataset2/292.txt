philosopher dramatist theologian have grapple with this question for century what make person go wrong interestingly I ask this question when I be a little kid I grow up in the South Bronx inner city ghetto in New York and I be surround by evil as all kid be who grow up in a inner city and I have friend who be really good kid who live out the Dr Jekyll Mr Hyde scenario Robert Louis Stevenson that be they take drug get in trouble go to jail some get kill and some do it without drug assistance so when I read Robert Louis Stevenson that be not fiction the only question be what be in the juice and more importantly that line between good and evil which privileged person like to think be fix and impermeable with they on the good side the other on the bad side I know that line be movable and it be permeable good person could be seduce across that line and under good and some rare circumstance bad kid could recover with help with reform with rehabilitation so I want to begin with this wonderful illusion by dutch artist m c Escher if you look at it and focus on the white what you see be a world full of angel but let look more deeply and as we do what appear be the demon the devil in the world that tell we several thing one the world be be will always be fill with good and evil because good and evil be the yin and yang of the human condition it tell I something else if you remember God favorite angel be Lucifer apparently Lucifer mean the light it also mean the morning star in some scripture and apparently he disobey God and that be the ultimate disobedience to authority and when he do Michael the archangel be send to kick he out of heaven along with the other fallen angel and so Lucifer descend into hell become Satan become the devil and the force of evil in the universe begin paradoxically it be God who create hell as a place to store evil he do not do a good job of keep it there though so this arc of the cosmic transformation of God favorite angel into the Devil for I set the context for understand human being who be transform from good ordinary person into perpetrator of evil so the Lucifer effect although it focus on the negative the negative that person can become not the negative that person be lead I to a psychological definition evil be the exercise of power and that be the key it be about power to intentionally harm person psychologically to hurt person physically to destroy person mortally or idea and to commit crime against humanity if you Google evil a word that should surely have wither by now you come up with 136 million hit in a third of a second a few year ago I be sure all of you be shock as I be with the revelation of American soldier abuse prisoner in a strange place in a controversial war Abu Ghraib in Iraq and this be man and woman who be put prisoner through unbelievable humiliation I be shocked but I be not surprised because I have see that same visual parallel when I be the prison superintendent of the Stanford Prison Study immediately the Bush administration military say what what all administration say when there be a scandal do not blame we it be not the system it be the few bad apple the few rogue soldier my hypothesis be American soldier be good usually maybe it be the barrel that be bad but how be I go to deal with that hypothesis I become a expert witness for one of the guard Sergeant Chip Frederick and in that position I have access to the dozen investigative report I have access to he I could study he have he come to my home get to know he do psychological analysis to see be he a good apple or bad apple and thirdly I have access to all of the 1 000 picture that this soldier take this picture be of a violent or sexual nature all of they come from the camera of American soldier because everybody have a digital camera or cell phone camera they take picture of everything more than 1 000 and what I have do be I organize they into various category but this be by United States military police army reservist they be not soldier prepare for this mission at all and it all happen in a single place Tier 1 a on the night shift why Tier 1 a be the center for military intelligence it be the interrogation hold the CIA be there interrogator from Titan Corporation all there and they be get no information about the insurgency so they be go to put pressure on this soldier military police to cross the line give they permission to break the will of the enemy to prepare they for interrogation to soften they up to take the glove off that be the euphemism and this be how it be interpret let go down to that dungeon typewrite Abu Ghraib Iraq Prison Abuses 2008 military police guard photo the follow image include nudity and graphic depiction of violence camera shutter sound Thuds Camera shutter Camera shutter Breathing Bells Bells end so pretty horrific that be one of the visual illustration of evil and it should not have escape you that the reason I pair the prisoner with he arm out with Leonardo da Vinci ode to humanity be that that prisoner be mentally ill that prisoner cover himself with shit every day they have to roll he in dirt so he would not stink but the guard end up call he Shit Boy what be he do in that prison rather than in some mental institution in any event here be former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld He come down and say I want to know who be responsible who be the bad apple well that be a bad question you have to reframe it and ask what be responsible what could be the who of person but it could also be the what of the situation and obviously that be wronghead how do psychologist try to understand such transformation of human character if you believe that they be good soldier before they go down to that dungeon there be three way the main way be call dispositional we look at what be inside of the person the bad apple this be the foundation of all of social science the foundation of religion the foundation of war Social psychologist like I come along and say yeah person be the actor on the stage but you will have to be aware of the situation who be the cast of character what be the costume be there a stage director and so we be interested in what be the external factor around the individual the bad barrel Social scientist stop there and they miss the big point that I discover when I become a expert witness for Abu Ghraib the power be in the system the system create the situation that corrupt the individual and the system be the legal political economic cultural background and this be where the power be of the bad barrel maker if you want to change a person change the situation and to change it you have get to know where the power be in the system so the Lucifer effect involve understand human character transformation with this three factor and it be a dynamic interplay what do the person bring into the situation what do the situation bring out of they and what be the system that create and maintain that situation my recent book the Lucifer Effect be about how do you understand how good person turn evil and it have a lot of detail about what I be go to talk about today so Dr Z Lucifer Effect although it focus on evil really be a celebration of the human mind infinite capacity to make any of we kind or cruel caring or indifferent creative or destructive and it make some of we villain and the good news that I be go to hopefully come to at the end be that it make some of we hero this wonderful cartoon in the New Yorker summarize my whole talk I be neither a good cop nor a bad cop Jerome like yourself I be a complex amalgam of positive and negative personality trait that emerge or not depend on the circumstance laughter there be a study some of you think you know about but very few person have ever read the story you watch the movie this be Stanley Milgram little Jewish kid from the Bronx and he ask the question could the Holocaust happen here now person say no that be Nazi Germany Hitler you know that be 1939 he say yeah but suppose Hitler ask you would you electrocute a stranger no way I be a good person he say why do not we put you in a situation and give you a chance to see what you would do and so what he do be he test 1 000 ordinary person 500 New Haven Connecticut 500 Bridgeport and the ad say psychologist want to understand memory we want to improve person memory because it be the key to success ok we be go to give you five buck four dollar for you time we do not want college student we want man between 20 and 50 in the later study they run woman ordinary person barber clerk white collar person so you go down one of you will be a learner one will be a teacher the learner a genial middle aged guy he get tie up to the shock apparatus in another room the learner could be middle aged could be as young as 20 and one of you be tell by the authority the guy in the lab coat you job as teacher be to give he material to learn get it right reward get it wrong you press a button on the shock box the first button be 15 volt he do not even feel it that be the key all evil start with 15 volt and then the next step be another 15 volt the problem be at the end of the line it be 450 volt and as you go along the guy be scream I have get a heart condition I be out of here you be a good person you complain Sir who will be responsible if something happen to he the experimenter say do not worry I will be responsible continue teacher and the question be who would go all the way to 450 volt you should notice here when it get up to 375 it say Danger severe shock when it get up to here there be XXX the pornography of power so Milgram ask 40 psychiatrist what percent of American citizen would go to the end they say only one percent because that be sadistic behavior and we know psychiatry know only one percent of American be sadistic ok here be the datum they could not be more wrong two third go all the way to 450 volt this be just one study Milgram do more than 16 study and look at this in study 16 where you see somebody like you go all the way 90 percent go all the way in study five if you see person rebel 90 percent rebel what about woman study 13 no different than man so Milgram be quantify evil as the willingness of person to blindly obey authority to go all the way to 450 volt and it be like a dial on human nature a dial in a sense that you can make almost everybody totally obedient down to the majority down to none what be the external parallel for all research be artificial what be the validity in the real world 912 American citizen commit suicide or be murder by family and friend in Guyana jungle in 1978 because they be blindly obedient to this guy they pastor not they priest they pastor Reverend Jim Jones he persuade they to commit mass suicide and so he be the modern Lucifer effect a man of God who become the Angel of Death Milgram study be all about individual authority to control person most of the time we be in institution so the Stanford Prison Study be a study of the power of institution to influence individual behavior interestingly Stanley Milgram and I be in the same high school class in James Monroe in the Bronx 1954 I do this study with my graduate student especially Craig Haney and it also begin work with a ad we have a cheap little ad but we want college student for a study of prison life 75 person volunteer take personality test we do interview pick two dozen the most normal the most healthy randomly assign they to be prisoner and guard so on day one we know we have good apple I be go to put they in a bad situation and secondly we know there be no difference between the boy who will be guard and that who will be prisoner to the prisoner we say wait at home the study will begin Sunday we do not tell they that the city police be go to come and do realistic arrest Video Music Day 1 student a police car pull up in front and a cop come to the front door and knock and say he be look for I so they right there you know they take I out the door they put my hand against the car it be a real cop car it be a real policeman and there be real neighbor in the street who do not know that this be a experiment and there be camera all around and neighbor all around they put I in the car then they drive I around Palo Alto they take I to the basement of the police station then they put I in a cell I be the first one to be pick up so they put I in a cell which be just like a room with a door with bar on it you could tell it be not a real jail they lock I in there in this degrading little outfit they be take this experiment too seriously here be the prisoner who be go to be dehumanize they will become number here be the guard with the symbol of power and anonymity guard get prisoner to clean the toilet bowl out with they bare hand to do other humiliating task they strip they naked they sexually taunt they they begin to do degrading activity like have they simulate sodomy you see simulate fellatio in soldier in Abu Ghraib my guard do it in five day the stress reaction be so extreme that normal kid we pick because they be healthy have breakdown within 36 hour the study end after six day because it be out of control five kid have emotional breakdown do it make a difference if warrior go to battle change they appearance or not if they be anonymous how do they treat they victim in some culture they go to war without change they appearance in other they paint themselves like Lord of the Flies in some they wear mask in many soldier be anonymous in uniform so this anthropologist John Watson find 23 culture that have two bit of datum do they change they appearance 15 do they kill torture mutilate 13 if they do not change they appearance only one of eight kill torture or mutilate the key be in the red zone if they change they appearance 12 of 13 that be 90 percent kill torture mutilate and that be the power of anonymity so what be the seven social process that grease the slippery slope of evil mindlessly take the first small step dehumanization of other De individuation of self diffusion of personal responsibility blind obedience to authority uncritical conformity to group norm Passive tolerance of evil through inaction or indifference and it happen when you be in a new or unfamiliar situation you habitual response pattern do not work you personality and morality be disengage nothing be easy than to denounce the evildoer nothing more difficult than understand he Dostoyevsky understand be not excuse psychology be not excuse ology so social and psychological research reveal how ordinary good person can be transform without the drug you do not need it you just need the social psychological process real world parallel compare this with this James Schlesinger I be go to end with this say psychologist have attempt to understand how and why individual and group who usually act humanely can sometimes act otherwise in certain circumstance that be the Lucifer effect and he go on to say the landmark Stanford study provide a cautionary tale for all military operation if you give person power without oversight it be a prescription for abuse they know that and let that happen so another report a investigative report by General Fay say the system be guilty in this report he say it be the environment that create Abu Ghraib by leadership failure that contribute to the occurrence of such abuse and because it remain undiscovered by high authority for a long period of time that abuse go on for three month who be watch the store the answer be nobody I think on purpose he give the guard permission to do that thing and they know nobody be ever go to come down to that dungeon so you need a paradigm shift in all of this area the shift be away from the medical model that focus only on the individual the shift be toward a public health model that recognize situational and systemic vector of disease bullying be a disease prejudice be a disease violence be a disease since the Inquisition we have be deal with problem at the individual level it do not work Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn say the line between good and evil cut through the heart of every human being that mean that line be not out there that be a decision that you have to make a personal thing so I want to end very quickly on a positive note heroism as the antidote to evil by promote the heroic imagination especially in we kid in we educational system we want kid to think I be a hero in wait wait for the right situation to come along and I will act heroically my whole life I be now go to focus away from evil that I have be in since I be a kid to understanding hero banality of heroism it be ordinary person who do heroic deed it be the counterpoint to Hannah Arendt banality of evil we traditional societal hero be wrong because they be the exception they organize they life around this that be why we know they name we kid hero be also wrong model for they because they have supernatural talent we want we kid to realize most hero be everyday person and the heroic act be unusual this be Joe Darby he be the one that stop that abuse you see because when he see that image he turn they over to a senior investigate officer he be a low level private and that stop it be he a hero no they have to put he in hiding because person want to kill he and then he mother and he wife for three year they be in hide this be the woman who stop the Stanford Prison Study when I say it get out of control I be the prison superintendent I do not know it be out of control I be totally indifferent she see that madhouse and say you know what it be terrible what you be do to that boy they be not prisoner nor guard they be boy and you be responsible and I end the study the next day the good news be I marry she the next year laughter applause I just come to my sens obviously so situation have the power to do three thing but the point be this be the same situation that can inflame the hostile imagination in some of we that make we perpetrator of evil can inspire the heroic imagination in other it be the same situation and you be on one side or the other most person be guilty of the evil of inaction because you mother say do not get involved mind you own business and you have to say Mama humanity be my business so the psychology of heroism be we be go to end in a moment how do we encourage child in new hero course that I be work on with Matt Langdon he have a hero workshop to develop this heroic imagination this self labeling I be a hero in wait and teach they skill to be a hero you have to learn to be a deviant because you be always go against the conformity of the group Heroes be ordinary person whose social action be extraordinary who act the key to heroism be two thing you have to act when other person be passive B you have to act socio centrically not egocentrically and I want to end with a know story about Wesley Autrey New York subway hero fifty year old African American construction worker stand on a subway a white guy fall on the track the subway train be come there be 75 person there you know what they freeze he be get a reason not to get involved he be black the guy white and he be get two kid instead he give he kid to a stranger jump on the track put the guy between the track lay on he the subway go over he Wesley and the guy 20 and a half inch height the train clearance be 21 inch a half a inch would have take he head off and he say I do what anyone could do no big deal to jump on the track and the moral imperative be I do what everyone should do and so one day you will be in a new situation take path one you be go to be a perpetrator of evil evil meaning you be go to be Arthur Andersen you be go to cheat or you be go to allow bullying path two you become guilty of the evil of passive inaction path three you become a hero the point be be we ready to take the path to celebrate ordinary hero wait for the right situation to come along to put heroic imagination into action because it may only happen once in you life and when you pass it by you will always know I could have be a hero and I let it pass I by so the point be think it and then do it so I want to thank you thank you let oppose the power of evil system at home and abroad and let focus on the positive advocate for respect of personal dignity for justice and peace which sadly we administration have not be do thanks so much applause
