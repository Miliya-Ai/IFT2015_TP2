most person do not know that when I go to high school in this country I apply for university at a time when I be convince I be go to be a artist and be a sculptor and I come from a very privileged background I be very lucky my family be wealthy and my father believe in one thing and that be to give we all as much education as we want and I announce I want to be a sculptor in Paris and he be a clever man he sort of say well that be ok but you have do very well in you math sat in fact I have get a 800 and he think I do very well and I do too in the art this be my passion and he say if you go to MIT to which I have be give early admission I will pay for every year you be at MIT in graduate or undergraduate as much as you want I will pay for a equal number of year for you to live in Paris and I think that be the good deal in town so I accept it immediately and I decide that if I be good in art and I be good in mathematics I would study architecture which be the blending of the two I go and tell my headmaster that at prep school and I say to he what I be do that I be go to go study architecture because it be art and mathematics put together he say to I something that just go completely over my head he say you know I like grey suit and I like pin striped suit but I do not like grey pin strip suit and I think what a turkey this guy be and I go off to MIT I study architecture then do a second degree in architecture and then actually quickly realize that it be not architecture that really the mixing of art and science be computer and that that really be the place to bring both and enjoy a career do that and probably if I be to fill out Jim Citrin scale I would put 100 percent on the side of the equation where you spend time make it possible for other to be creative and after do this for a long time and the Media Lab pass the baton on I think well maybe it be time for I to do a project something that would be important but also something that would take advantage of all of this privilege that one have and in the case of the Media Lab know a lot of person know person who be either executive or wealthy and also not have in my own case a career to worry about anymore my career I mean I would do my career do not have to worry about earn money do not have to worry about what person think about I and I say boy let really do something that take advantage of all this feature and think that if we could address education by leverage the child and bring to the world the access of the computer that that be really the thing we should do never show this picture before and probably go to be sue for it it be take at three o clock in the morning without the permission of the company it be about two week old there they be folk applause if you look at the picture you will see they be stack up that be conveyor belt that go around this be one of the conveyor belt with the thing go by but then you will see the one up above what happen be they burn into flash memory the software and then test they for a few hour but you have get to have the thing move on the assembly line because it be constant so they go around in this loop which be why you see they up there so this be great for we because it be a real turning point but it go back this picture be take in 1982 just before the IBM pc be even announce Seymour Papert and I be bring computer to school and develop nation at a time when it be way ahead of itself but one thing we learn be that this kid can absolutely jump into it just the same way as we kid do here and when person tell I who be go to teach the teacher to teach the kid I say to myself what planet do you come from okay there be not a person in this room I do not care how techie you be there be not a person in this room that do not give they laptop or cell phone to a kid to help they debug it ok we all need help even that of we who be very seasoned this picture of Seymour 25 year ago Seymour make a very simple observation in 1968 and then basically present it in 1970 April 11 to be precise call Teaching Children think what he observe be that kid who write computer program understand thing differently and when they debug the program they come the close to learn about learn that be very important and in some sense we have lose that kid do not program enough and boy if there be anything I hope this bring back it be program to kid it be really important use application be ok but programming be absolutely fundamental this be be launch with three language in it Squeak Logo and a third that I have never even see before the point be this be go to be very very intensive on the programming side this photograph be very important because it be much later this be in the early 2000 my son Dimitri who be here many of you know Dimitri go to Cambodia set up this school that we have build just as the school connect it to the internet and this kid have they laptop but it be really what spirit this plus the influence of Joe and other we start one laptop per child this be the same village in Cambodia just a couple of month ago this kid be real pro there be just 7 000 machine out there be test by kid be a nonprofit be absolutely fundamental everybody advise I not to be a nonprofit but they be all wrong and the reason be a nonprofit be important be actually twofold there be many reason but the two that merit the little bit of time be one the clarity of purpose be there the moral purpose be clear I can see any head of state any executive I want at any time because I be not sell laptop ok I have no shareholder whether we sell it do not make any difference whatsoever the clarity of purpose be absolutely critical and the second be very counterintuitive you can get the good person in the world if you look at we professional service include search firm include communication include legal service include banking they be all pro bono and it be not to save money we have get money in the bank it be because you get the good person you get the person who be do it because they believe in the mission and they be the good person we could not afford to hire a CFO we put out a job description for a CFO at zero salary and we have a queue of person it allow you to team up with person the U N be not go to be we partner if we be profit make so announce this with Kofi Annan be very important and the u n allow we to basically reach all the country and this be the machine we be show before I meet Yves Behar and while this machine in some sense be silly in retrospect it actually serve a very important purpose that pencil yellow crank be remember by everybody everybody remember the pencil yellow crank it be different it be get its power in a different way it be kind of childlike even though this be not the direction we go because the crank it really be stupid to have it on board by the way in spite of what some person in the press do not get it do not understand it we do not take it off because we do not want to do have it on the laptop itself be really not what you want you want a separate thing like the ac adaptor I do not bring one with I but they really work much good off board and then I could tell you lot about the laptop but I decide on just four thing just keep in mind because there be other person include Bill Gates who say Gee you have get a real computer that computer be unlike anything you have have and do thing there be four of they that you do not come close to and it be very important to be low power and I hope that be pick up more by the industry that the reason that you want to be below two watt be that be roughly what you can generate with you upper body dual mode display that sunlight display fantastic we be use it at lunch today in the sunlight and the more sunlight the good and that be really critical the mesh network it will become commonplace and of course rugged go without say and the reason I think design matter be not because I want to go to art school and by the way when I graduate from MIT I think the bad and silly thing to do would be to go to Paris for six year laughter so I do not do that but design matter for a number of reason the most important be that it be the good way to make a inexpensive product most person make inexpensive product by take cheap design cheap labor cheap component and make a cheap laptop and in English the word cheap have a double meaning which be really appropriate because it be cheap in the pejorative sense as well as inexpensive but if you take a different approach and you think of very large scale integration very advanced material very advanced manufacturing so you be pour chemical in one end iPods be spew out the other and really cool design that be what we want to do and I can race through this and save a lot of time because Yves and I obviously do not compare note this be he slide and so I do not have to talk about they but it be really to we very important as a strategy it be not just to kind of make it cute because somebody you know good design be very important Yves show one of the power generate device the mesh network the reason I and I will not go into it in great detail but when we deliver laptop to kid in the remote and poor part of the world they be connected there be not just laptop and so we have to drop in satellite dish we put in generator it be a lot of stuff that go behind this this can talk to each other if you be in a desert they can talk to each other about two kilometer apart if you be in the jungle it be about 500 meter so if a kid bicycle home or walk a few mile they be go to be off the grid so to speak they be not go to be near another laptop so you have to nail this onto a tree and sort of get it you do not call Verizon or Sprint you build you own network and that be very important the user interface we be launch with 18 keyboard English be by far the minority latin be relatively rare too you just look at some of the language I be willing to suspect some of you have not even hear of they before be there anybody in the room one person unless you work with OLPC be there anybody in the room that can tell I what language the keyboard be that be on the screen there be only one hand so you get it yes you be right he be right it be Amharic it be Ethiopian in Ethiopia there be never be a keyboard there be no keyboard standard because there be no market and this be the big difference again when you be a nonprofit you look at child as a mission not as a market so we go to Ethiopia and we help they make a keyboard and this will become the standard Ethiopian keyboard so what I want to end with be sort of what we be do to roll it out and we change strategy completely I decide at the begin it be a pretty good thing to decide in the begin it be not what we be do now be to go to six country big country one of they be not so big but it be rich here be the six we go to the six and in each case the head of state say he would do it he would do a million in the case of Gaddafi he would do 1 2 million and that they would launch it we think this be exactly the right strategy get it out and then the little country could sort of piggyback on this big country and so I go to each of that country at least six time meet with the head of state probably two or three time in each case get the minister go through a lot of the stuff this be a period in my life where I be travel 330 day per year not something you would envy or want to do in the case of Libya it be a lot of fun meeting Gaddafi in he tent the camel smell be unbelievable and it be 45 degree c I mean this be not what you would call a cool experience and former country I say former because none of they really come through this summer there be a big difference between get a head of state to have a photo opportunity make a press release so we go to small one Uruguay bless they heart small country not so rich President say he would do it and guess what he do do it the tender have nothing in it that relate to we nothing specific about sunlight readable mesh network low power but just a vanilla laptop proposal and guess what we win it hand down when it be announce that they be go to do every child in Uruguay the first 100 000 boom go to OLPC the next day the next day not even 24 hour have pass in Peru the president of Peru say we will do 250 and boom a little domino effect the president of Rwanda step in and say he would do it the president of Ethiopia say he would do it and boom boom boom the president of Mongolia and so what happen be this thing start to happen with this country still not enough add up all that country it do not quite get to thing so we say let start a program in the United States so end of August early September we decide to do this we announce it near the middle end just when the Clinton Initiative be take place we think that be a good time to announce it launch it on the 12 of November we say it would be just for a short period until the 26 we have extend it until the 31 and the give one get one program be really important because it get a lot of person absolutely interested the first day it be just wild and then we say well let get person to give many not just one and get one but maybe give 100 give 1 000 and that be where you come in and that be where I think it be very important I do not want you all to go out and buy 400 dollar worth of laptop okay do it but that be not go to help okay if everybody in this room go out tonight and order one of this thing for 400 dollar whatever it be 300 person in the room do it yeah great I want you do something else and it be not to go out and buy 100 or 1 000 though I invite you to do that and 10 000 would be even good tell person about it it be get to become viral ok use you mailing list person in this room have extraordinary mailing list get you friend to give one get one and if each one of you send it to 300 or 400 person that would be fantastic I will not dwell on the pricing at all just to say that when you do the give one get one a lot of press be a bit about they do not make it it be 188 dollar it be not 100 it will be 100 in two year it will go below 100 we have pledge not to add feature but to bring that price down but it be the country that want it to go up and we let they push it up for all sort of reason so what you can do I have just say it do not just give one get one I just want to end with one last one this one be not even 24 hour old or maybe it be 24 hour the first kid get they laptop they get they by ship and I be talk now about 7 000 8 000 at a time go out this week they go to Uruguay Peru Mexico and it be be slow come and we be only make about 5 000 a week but we hope we hope sometime in next year maybe by the middle of the year to hit a million a month now put that number and a million be not so much it be not a big number we be sell a billion cell phone worldwide this year but a million a month in laptop land be a big number and the world production today everybody combine make laptop be five million a month so I be stand here tell you that sometime next year we be go to make 20 percent of the world production and if we do that there be go to be a lot of lucky kid out there and we hope if you have EG two year from now or whenever you have it again I will not have bad breath and I will be invite back and will have hopefully by then maybe 100 million out there to child thank you applause
