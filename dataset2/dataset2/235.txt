last year I tell you the story in seven minute of Project Orion which be this very implausible technology that technically could have work but it have this one year political window where it could have happen so it do not happen it be a dream that do not happen this year I be go to tell you the story of the birth of digital computing this be a perfect introduction and it be a story that do work it do happen and the machine be all around we and it be a technology that be inevitable if the person I be go to tell you the story about if they have not do it somebody else would have so it be sort of the right idea at the right time this be Barricelli universe this be the universe we live in now it be the universe in which this machine be now do all this thing include change biology I be start the story with the first atomic bomb at Trinity which be the Manhattan Project it be a little bit like TED it bring a whole lot of very smart person together and three of the smart person be Stan Ulam Richard Feynman and John von Neumann and it be Von Neumann who say after the bomb he be work on something much more important than bomb he be think about computer so he be not only think about they he build one this be the machine he build laughter he build this machine and we have a beautiful demonstration of how this thing really work with this little bit and it be a idea that go way back the first person to really explain that be Thomas Hobbes who in 1651 explain how arithmetic and logic be the same thing and if you want to do artificial thinking and artificial logic you can do it all with arithmetic he say you need addition and subtraction Leibniz who come a little bit late this be 1679 show that you do not even need subtraction you could do the whole thing with addition here we have all the binary arithmetic and logic that drive the computer revolution and Leibniz be the first person to really talk about build such a machine he talk about do it with marble have gate and what we now call shift register where you shift the gate drop the marble down the track and that be what all this machine be do except instead of do it with marble they be do it with electron and then we jump to Von Neumann 1945 when he sort of reinvent the whole same thing and 1945 after the war the electronics exist to actually try and build such a machine so June 1945 actually the bomb have not even be drop yet and Von Neumann be put together all the theory to actually build this thing which also go back to Turing who before that give the idea that you could do all this with a very brainless little finite state machine just read a tape in and read a tape out the other sort of genesis of what Von Neumann do be the difficulty of how you would predict the weather Lewis Richardson see how you could do this with a cellular array of person give they each a little chunk and put it together here we have a electrical model illustrate a mind have a will but capable of only two idea laughter and that be really the simple computer it be basically why you need the qubit because it only have two idea and you put lot of that together you get the essential of the modern computer the arithmetic unit the central control the memory the recording medium the input and the output but there be one catch this be the fatal you know we see it in start this program up the instruction which govern this operation must be give in absolutely exhaustive detail so the programming have to be perfect or it will not work if you look at the origin of this the classic history sort of take it all back to the ENIAC here but actually the machine I be go to tell you about the Institute for Advanced Study machine which be way up there really should be down there so I be try to revise history and give some of this guy more credit than they have have such a computer would open up universe which be at the present outside the range of any instrument so it open up a whole new world and this person see it the guy who be suppose to build this machine be the guy in the middle Vladimir Zworykin from RCA RCA in probably one of the lousy business decision of all time decide not to go into computer but the first meeting November 1945 be at RCA office rca start this whole thing off and say you know television be the future not computer the essential be all there all the thing that make this machine run Von Neumann and a logician and a mathematician from the army put this together then they need a place to build it when RCA say no that be when they decide to build it in Princeton where Freeman work at the Institute that be where I grow up as a kid that be I that be my sister Esther who be talk to you before so we both go back to the birth of this thing that be Freeman a long time ago and that be I and this be Von Neumann and Morgenstern who write the theory of Games all this force come together there in Princeton Oppenheimer who have build the bomb the machine be actually use mainly for do bomb calculation and Julian Bigelow who take Zworkykin place as the engineer to actually figure out use electronics how you would build this thing the whole gang of person who come to work on this and woman in front who actually do most of the coding be the first programmer this be the prototype geek the nerd they do not fit in at the Institute this be a letter from the director concern about especially unfair on the matter of sugar laughter you can read the text laughter this be hacker get in trouble for the first time laughter this be not theoretical physicist they be real soldering gun type guy and they actually build this thing and we take it for grant now that each of this machine have billion of transistor do billion of cycle per second without fail they be use vacuum tube very narrow sloppy technique to get actually binary behavior out of this radio vacuum tube they actually use 6j6 the common radio tube because they find they be more reliable than the more expensive tube and what they do at the Institute be publish every step of the way report be issue so that this machine be clone at 15 other place around the world and it really be it be the original microprocessor all the computer now be copy of that machine the memory be in cathode ray tube a whole bunch of spot on the face of the tube very very sensitive to electromagnetic disturbance so there be 40 of this tube like a v 40 engine run the memory laughter the input and the output be by teletype tape at first this be a wire drive use bicycle wheel this be the archetype of the hard disk that be in you machine now then they switch to a magnetic drum this be modify IBM equipment which be the origin of the whole data processing industry later at IBM and this be the beginning of computer graphic the Graph g Beam turn on this next slide that be the as far as I know the first digital bitmap display 1954 so Von Neumann be already off in a theoretical cloud do abstract sort of study of how you could build reliable machine out of unreliable component that guy drink all the tea with sugar in it be write in they logbook try to get this thing to work with all this 2 600 vacuum tube that fail half the time and that be what I have be do this last six month be go through the log run time two minute input output 90 minute this include a large amount of human error so they be always try to figure out what be machine error what be human error what be code what be hardware that be a engineer gaze at tube number 36 try to figure out why the memory be not in focus he have to focus the memory seem ok so he have to focus each tube just to get the memory up and run let alone have you know software problem no use go home laughter impossible to follow the damn thing where be a directory so already they be complain about the manual before close down in disgust the general arithmetic operate log burn lot of midnight oil maniac which become the acronym for the machine Mathematical and Numerical Integrator and Calculator lose its memory maniac regain its memory when the power go off machine or human aha so they figure out it be a code problem find trouble in code I hope Code error machine not guilty damn it I can be just as stubborn as this thing laughter and the dawn come so they run all night twenty four hour a day this thing be run mainly run bomb calculation everything up to this point be waste time what be the use good night Master control off the hell with it Way off laughter something wrong with the air conditioner smell of burn v belt in the air a short do not turn the machine on IBM machine put a tar like substance on the card the tar be from the roof so they really be work under tough condition laughter here a mouse have climb into the blower behind the regulator rack set blower to vibrate result no more mouse laughter here lie mouse bear die 4 50 a m may 1953 laughter there be a inside joke someone have pencil in here lie Marston Mouse if you be a mathematician you get that because Marston be a mathematician who object to the computer be there pick a lightning bug off the drum run at two kilocycle that be two thousand cycle per second yes I be chicken so two kilocycle be slow speed the high speed be 16 kilocycle I do not know if you remember a Mac that be 16 Megahertz that be slow speed I have now duplicate both result how will I know which be right assume one result be correct this now be the third different output I know when I be lick laughter we have duplicate error before machine run fine code be not only happen when the machine be run and sometimes thing be okay machine a thing of beauty and a joy forever perfect run parting think when there be big and good error we will have they so nobody be suppose to know they be actually design bomb they be design hydrogen bomb but someone in the logbook late one night finally draw a bomb so that be the result it be Mike the first thermonuclear bomb in 1952 that be design on that machine in the wood behind the Institute so Von Neumann invite a whole gang of weirdo from all over the world to work on all this problem Barricelli he come to do what we now call really artificial life try to see if in this artificial universe he be a viral geneticist way way way ahead of he time he be still ahead of some of the stuff that be be do now try to start a artificial genetic system run in the computer begin he universe start March 3 53 so it be almost exactly it be 50 year ago next Tuesday I guess and he see everything in term of he could read the binary code straight off the machine he have a wonderful rapport other person could not get the machine run it always work for he even error be duplicate laughter Dr Barricelli claim machine be wrong code be right so he design this universe and run it when the bomb person go home he be allow in there he would run that thing all night long run this thing if anybody remember Stephen Wolfram who reinvent this stuff and he publish it it be not lock up and disappear it be publish in the literature if it be that easy to create live organism why not create a few yourself so he decide to give it a try to start this artificial biology go in the machine and he find all this sort of it be like a naturalist come in and look at this tiny 5 000 byte universe and see all this thing happen that we see in the outside world in biology this be some of the generation of he universe but they be just go to stay number they be not go to become organism they have to have something you have a genotype and you have to have a phenotype they have to go out and do something and he start do that start give this little numerical organism thing they could play with play chess with other machine and so on and they do start to evolve and he go around the country after that every time there be a new fast machine he start use it and see exactly what be happen now that the program instead of be turn off when you quit the program you would keep run and basically all the sort of thing like Windows be do run as a multi cellular organism on many machine he envision all that happen and he see that evolution itself be a intelligent process it be not any sort of creator intelligence but the thing itself be a giant parallel computation that would have some intelligence and he go out of he way to say that he be not say this be lifelike or a new kind of life it just be another version of the same thing happen and there be really no difference between what he be do in the computer and what nature do billion of year ago and could you do it again now so when I go into this archive look at this stuff lo and behold the archivist come up one day say I think we find another box that have be throw out and it be he universe on punch card so there it be 50 year later sit there sort of suspend animation that be the instruction for run this be actually the source code for one of that universe with a note from the engineer say they be have some problem there must be something about this code that you have not explain yet and I think that be really the truth we still do not understand how this very simple instruction can lead to increase complexity what be the divide line between when that be lifelike and when it really be alive this card now thanks to I show up be be save and the question be should we run they or not you know could we get they run do you want to let it loose on the internet this machine would think they this organism if they come back to life now whether they have die and go to heaven there be a universe my laptop be 10 thousand million time the size of the universe that they live in when Barricelli quit the project he be think far ahead to how this would really grow into a new kind of life and that be what be happen when Juan Enriquez tell we about this 12 trillion bit be transfer back and forth of all this genomic datum go to the proteomic lab that be what Barricelli imagine that this digital code in this machine be actually start to code it already be code from nucleic acid we have be do that since you know since we start pcr and synthesize small string of dna and real soon we be actually go to be synthesize the proteins and like Steve show we that just open a entirely new world it be a world that Von Neumann himself envision this be publish after he die he sort of unfinished note on self reproduce machine what it take to get the machine sort of jump start to where they begin to reproduce it take really three person Barricelli have the concept of the code as a live thing Von Neumann see how you could build the machine that now last count four million of this Von Neumann machine be build every 24 hour and Julian Bigelow who die 10 day ago this be John Markoff obituary for he he be the important missing link the engineer who come in and know how to put that vacuum tube together and make it work and all we computer have inside they the copy of the architecture that he have to just design one day sort of on pencil and paper and we owe a tremendous credit to that and he explain in a very generous way the spirit that bring all this different person to the Institute for Advanced Study in the 40 to do this project and make it freely available with no patent no restriction no intellectual property dispute to the rest of the world that be the last entry in the logbook when the machine be shut down July 1958 and it be Julian Bigelow who be run it until midnight when the machine be officially turn off and that be the end thank you very much applause
