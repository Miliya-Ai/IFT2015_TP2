first of all I be a geek I be a organic food eat carbon footprint minimize robotic surgery geek and I really want to build green but I be very suspicious of all of this well mean article person long on moral authority and short on datum tell I how to do this kind of thing and so I have to figure this out for myself for example be this evil I have drop a blob of organic yogurt from happy self actualize local cow on my counter top and I grab a paper towel and I want to wipe it up but can I use a paper towel laughter the answer to this can be find in embody energy this be the amount of energy that go into any paper towel or embody water and every time I use a paper towel I be use this much virtual energy and water wipe it up throw it away now if I compare that to a cotton towel that I can use a thousand time I do not have a whole lot of embody energy until I wash that yogurty towel this be now operate energy so if I throw my towel in the washing machine I have now put energy and water back into that towel unless I use a front loading high efficiency wash machine laughter and then it look a little bit well but what about a recycled paper towel that come in that little half sheet well now a paper towel look good screw the paper towel let go to a sponge I wipe it up with a sponge and I put it under the running water and I have a lot less energy and a lot more water unless you be like I and you leave the handle in the position of hot even when you turn it on and then you start to use more energy or bad you let it run until it be warm to rinse out you towel and now all bet be off laughter so what this say be that sometimes the thing that you least expect the position in which you put the handle have a big effect than any of that other thing that you be try to optimize now imagine someone as twist as I try to build a house laughter that be what my husband and I be do right now and so we want to know how green could we be and there be a thousand and one article out there tell we how to make all this green trade off and they be just as suspect in tell we to optimize this little thing around the edge and miss the elephant in the living room now the average house have about 300 megawatt hour of embody energy in it this be the energy it take to make it million and million of paper towel we want to know how much good we could do and so like many person we start with a house on a lot and I be go to show you a typical construction on the top and what we be do on the bottom so first we demolish it it take some energy but if you deconstruct it you take it all apart you use the bit you can get some of that energy back we then dig a big hole to put in a rainwater catchment tank to take we yard water independent and then we pour a big foundation for passive solar now you can reduce the embody energy by about 25 percent by use high fly ash concrete we then put in frame and so this be frame lumber composite material and it be kind of hard to get the embody energy out of that but it can be a sustainable resource if you use FSC certified lumber we then go on to the first thing that be very surprising if we put aluminum window in this house we would double the energy use right there now PVC be a little bit well but still not as good as the wood that we choose we then put in plumbing electrical and hvac and insulate now spray foam be a excellent insulator it fill in all the crack but it be pretty high embody energy and spray in cellulose or blue jeans be a much low energy alternative to that we also use straw bale infill for we library which have zero embody energy when it come time to sheetrock if you use EcoRock it be about a quarter of the embody energy of standard sheetrock and then you get to the finish the subject of all of that go green article and on the scale of a house they almost make no difference at all and yet all the press be focus on that except for flooring if you put carpeting in you house it be about a tenth of the embody energy of the entire house unless you use concrete or wood for a much low embody energy so now we add in the final construction energy we add it all up and we have build a house for less than half of the typical embody energy for build a house like this but before we pat ourselves too much on the back we have pour 151 megawatt hour of energy into construct this house when there be a house there before and so the question be how could we make that back and so if I run my new energy efficient house forward compare with the old non energy efficient house we make it back in about six year now I probably would have upgrade the old house to be more energy efficient and in that case it would take I more about 20 year to break even now if I have not pay attention to embody energy it would have take we over 50 year to break even compare to the upgrade house so what do this mean on the scale of my portion of the house this be equivalent to about as much as I drive in a year it be about five time as much as if I go entirely vegetarian but my elephant in the living room fly clearly I need to walk home from TED but all the calculation for embody energy be on the blog and remember it be sometimes the thing that you be not expect to be the big change that be thank you applause
