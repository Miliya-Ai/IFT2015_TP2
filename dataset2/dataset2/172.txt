here be my thing hold on there I go hey I want to start today talk about the structure of a polypeptide laughter I get a lot of person ask I in term of lose you know what the hell that island you know it be usually follow by no seriously what the hell be that island why so many mystery what be it about mystery that I seem to be draw to and I be think about this what to talk about at TED when I talk to the kind rep from TED and I say listen you know what should I talk about he say do not worry about it just be profound laughter and I take enormous comfort in that so thank you if you be here I be try to think what do I talk about good question why do I do so much stuff that involve mystery and I start try to figure it out and I start think about why do I do any of what I do and I start think about my grandfather I love my grandfather Harry Kelvin be he name my mother father he die in 1986 he be a amazing guy and one of the reason he be amazing after World War II he begin a electronics company he start sell surplus part kit to school and stuff so he have this incredible curiosity as a kid I see he come over to I with radio and telephone and all sort of thing and he would open they up he have unscrew they and reveal the inner workings which many of we I be sure take for grant but it be a amazing gift to give a kid to open up this thing and show how it work and why it work and what it be he be the ultimate deconstructor in many way and my grandfather be a kind of guy who would not only take thing apart but he get I interested in all sort of different odd craft like you know print like the letter press I be obsess with printing I be obsess with silk screening and bookbinding and box make when I be a kid I be always like take apart box and stuff and last night in the hotel I take apart the Kleenex box I be just look at it and I be tell you laughter it be a beautiful thing I swear to God I mean when you look at the box and you sort of see how it work Rives be here and I meet he year ago at a book fair he do pop up book and I be obsess with engineering of paper the scoring of it the printing of it where the thing get glue the registration mark for the ink I just love box my grandfather be the guy who kind of get I into all sort of this thing he would also supply I with tool he be this amazing encourager this patron sort of to make stuff and he get I a Super 8 camera when I be 10 year old and in 1976 that be sort of a anomaly to be a 10 year old kid that have access to a camera and you know he be so generous I could not believe it he be not do it entirely without some manipulation I mean I would call he and I would be like listen Grandpa I really need this camera you do not understand this be like I want to make movie I will get invite to TED one day laughter and you know my grandmother be the great because she would be like you know she would get on the phone she would be like Harry it be good than the drug she be fantastic so I find myself get this stuff thanks to she assist and suddenly you know I have a synthesizer when I be 14 year old this kind of stuff and it let I make thing which to I be sort of the dream he sort of humor my obsession to other thing too like magic the thing be we have go to this magic store in New York City call Lou Tannen Magic it be this great magic store it be a crappy little building in Midtown but you would be in the elevator the elevator would open there would be this little small magic store you would be in the magic store and it be a magical place so I get all this magic trick here I will show you this be the kind of thing so it would be like you know which be good but now I can not move now I have to do the rest of the thing like this I be like oh wow look at my computer over there laughter so one of the thing that I buy at the magic store be this Tannen mystery Magic Box the premise behind the mystery Magic Box be the follow 15 dollar buy you 50 dollar worth of magic which be a savings laughter now I buy this decade ago and I be not kid if you look at this you will see it be never be open but I have have this forever now I be look at this it be in my office as it always be on the shelf and I be think why have I not open this and why have I keep it because I be not a pack rat I do not keep everything but for some reason I have not open this box and I feel like there be a key to this somehow in talk about something at TED that I have not discuss before and bored person elsewhere so I think maybe there be something with this and there be this giant question mark I love the design for what it be worth of this thing and I start think why have not I open it and I realize that I have not open it because it represent something important to I it represent my grandfather be I allow to cry at TED because no I be not go to cry laughter but laughter the thing be that it represent infinite possibility it represent hope it represent potential and what I love about this box and what I realize I sort of do in whatever it be that I do be I find myself draw to infinite possibility that sense of potential and I realize that mystery be the catalyst for imagination now it be not the most ground break idea but when I start to think that maybe there be time when mystery be more important than knowledge I start get interested in this and so I start think about lose and the stuff that we do and I realize oh my God mystery box be everywhere in what I do in the creation of lose Damon Lindelof and I who create the show with I we be basically task with create this series that we have very little time to do we have 11 and a half week to write it cast it crew it shoot it cut it post it turn in a two hour pilot so it be not a lot of time and that sense of possibility what could this thing be there be no time to develop it I be sure you be all familiar with person who tell you what you can not do and what you should change there be no time for that which be kind of amazing and so we do this show and for that of you who have not see it or do not know it I can show you one little clip from the pilot just to show you some stuff that we do Engine roar video Claire Help please help I help I please help I Jack get he out of here get he away from the engine get he out of here Engine roar c help I please I be have contraction j how many month pregnant be you C I be only eight month j and how far apart be they come C I do not know I think it just happen Man Hey Hey Hey get away from JJ Abrams 10 year ago if we want to do that we would have to kill a stuntman laughter it would be hard take two would be a bitch laughter so the amazing thing be we be able to do this thing and part of that be the amazing availability of technology know we could do anything I mean we could never have do that we might have be able to write it we would not have be able to depict it like we do so part of the amazing thing for I be in the creative process technology be mind blowingly inspire to I I realize that that blank page be a magic box you know it need to be fill with something fantastic I use to have the ordinary person script that I have flip through the romance be amazing to I it would inspire I I want to try and fill page with the same kind of spirit and thought and emotion that that script do so you know I love Apple computer I be obsessed so the Apple computer the PowerBook this computer it challenge I it basically say what be you go to write worthy of I I feel this I be compelled laughter and I often be like you know dude today I be out I get nothing you know so there be that in term of the content of it you look at story you think what be story but mystery box there be a fundamental question in tv the first act be call the teaser it be literally the teaser it be the big question so you be draw into it then there be another question and it go on look at Star Wars the droid meet the mysterious woman who be that we do not know mystery box then you meet Luke Skywalker he get the droid you see the holographic image you learn it be a message she want to find Obi Wan Kenobi he be she only hope but who be Obi Wan Kenobi mystery box so then he meet Ben Kenobi Ben Kenobi be Obi Wan Kenobi Holy shit so it keep we laughter have you guy not see that laughter it be huge anyway so there be this thing with mystery box that I start feel compelled then there be the thing of mystery in term of imagination the withholding of information you know do that intentionally be much more engaging whether it be like the shark in Jaws if Spielberg mechanical shark Bruce have work it would not be remotely as scary you would have see it too much in alien they never really show the alien terrifying even in a movie like a romantic comedy the graduate they be have that date and they be in the car and it be loud and so they put the top up you do not hear anything they be say you can not hear a word but it be the most romantic date ever and you love it because you do not hear it so to I there be that and then finally there be this idea stretch the paradigm a little bit but the idea of the mystery box mean what you think you be get then what you be really get and it be true in so many movie and story look at e t for example e t be this unbelievable movie about what it be about a alien who meet a kid right well it be not e t be about divorce e t be about a heartbroken divorce cripple family and ultimately this kid who can not find he way die hard right Crazy great fun action adventure movie in a building it be about a guy who be on the verge of divorce he be show up to l a tail between he leg there be great scene maybe not the most amazing dramatic scene in the history of time but pretty great scene there be a half a hour of investment in character before you get to the stuff that you be expect when you look at a movie like Jaws the scene that you expect we have the screen this be the kind of scene that you remember and expect from Jaws and she be be eat there be a shark woman scream the thing about Jaws be it be really about a guy who be sort of deal with he place in the world with he masculinity with he family how he be go to you know make it work in this new town this be one of my favorite scene ever and this be a scene that you would not necessarily think of when you think of Jaws but it be a amazing scene video Father C mere give we a kiss Son why Father cause I need it JJA come on why cause I need it best scene ever right laughter come on so you think of Jaws so that be the kind of stuff that like you know the investment of character which be the stuff that really be inside the box you know it be why when person do sequel or rip off movie you know of a genre they be rip off the wrong thing you be not suppose to rip off the shark or the monster you know if you rip something off rip off the character rip off the stuff that matter I mean look inside yourself and figure out what be inside you because ultimately the mystery box be all of we so there be that then the distribution what be a big mystery box than a movie theater you know you go to the theater you be just so excited to see anything the moment the light go down be often the good part and you be full of that amazing that feeling of excited anticipation and often the movie there and it be go and then something happen and you go oh and then mmm when it be a great movie you be along for the ride because you be willing to give yourself to it so to I whether it be a tv a iPod computer cell phone it be funny I be a as I say Apple fanatic and one day about a year or so ago I be sign on online in the morning to watch Steve Jobs keynote because I always do and he come on he be present the video ipod and what be on the enormous ipod behind he lose I have no idea and I realize holy shit it have come full circle the inspiration I get from the technology be now use the stuff that I do to sell technology it be nuts laughter I be go to show you a couple of other thing I be go to skip I will show you one other thing that have nothing to do with anything this be something online six year ago they do this this be a online thing do by guy who have some visual effect experience but the point be that they be do thing that be use this mystery box that they have everyone have now what I have realize be what my grandfather do for I when I be a kid everyone have access to now you do not need to have my grandfather though you wish you have but I have to tell you this be a guy do stuff on a quadra 950 computer the resolution a little bit low use infinity software they stop make 15 year ago he be do stuff that look as amazing as stuff I have see release from Hollywood the most incredible sort of mystery I think be now the question of what come next because it be now democratize so now the creation of media it be everywhere the stuff that I be lucky and beg for to get when I be a kid be now ubiquitous and so there be a amazing sense of opportunity out there and when I think of the filmmaker who exist out there now who would have be silence you know who have be silence in the past it be a very exciting thing I use to say in class and lecture and stuff to someone who want to write go write do you thing it be free you do not need permission but now I can say go make you movie there be nothing stop you from go out there and get the technology you can lease rent buy stuff off the shelf that be either as good or just as good as the stuff that be be use by the you know legit person no community be well serve when only the elite have control and I feel like this be a amazing opportunity to see what else be out there when I do Mission impossible iii we have amazing visual effect ILM do the effect it be incredible and sort of my dream to be involve and there be a couple of sequence in the movie like this couple of moment I will show you there be that Video Luther Ethan move Explosion obviously I have a obsession with big crazy explosion so my favorite visual effect in the movie be the one I be about to show you it be a scene in which Tom character wake up he be drowsy he be crazy and the guy wake up and he shove this gun in he nose and shoot this little capsule into he brain that he be go to use later to kill he as bad guy do video brownway good morning jja ok now when we shoot that scene the actor who have the gun a English actor Eddie Marsan sweetheart great guy he keep take the gun and put it into Tom nose and it be hurt Tom nose and I learn this very early on in my career do not hurt Tom nose laughter there be three thing you do not want to do number two be do not hurt Tom nose so Eddie have this gun and he be this sweet English guy he be like sorry I do not want to hurt you I be like we have to make this look good and I realize that we have to do something because it be not work and I think back to what I would have do use the Super 8 camera that my grandfather get I sit in that room and I realize that hand do not have to be Eddie Marsan it could be Tom and Tom would know just how hard to push the gun he would not hurt himself so we take he hand and we paint it to look a little bit more like Eddie we put it in Eddie sleeve and so the hand that you see that be not Eddie hand that be Tom so Tom be play two role laughter and he do not ask for any more money so here here watch it again there he be he be wake up he be drowsy be through a lot video brownway good morning JJA Tom hand Tom hand Tom hand anyway so applause thanks applause so you do not need the great technology to do thing that can work in movie and the mystery box in honor of my grandfather stay closed thank you applause
