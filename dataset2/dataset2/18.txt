my name be Lovegrove I only know nine Lovegroves two of which be my parent they be first cousin and you know what happen when you know laughter so there be a terribly weird freaky side to I which I be fight with all the time so to try and get through today I have kind of discipline myself with a 18 minute talk I be hang on to have a pee I think perhaps if I be hang on long enough that would guide I through the 18 minute laughter ok I be know as Captain Organic and that be a philosophical position as well as a aesthetic position but today what I would like to talk to you about be that love of form and how form can touch person soul and emotion not very long ago not many thousand of year ago we actually live in cave and I do not think we have lose that code system we respond so well to form but I be interested in create intelligent form I be not interested at all in blobism or any of that superficial rubbish that you see come out as design this artificially induce consumerism I think it be atrocious my world be the world of person like Amory Lovins Janine Benyus James Watson I be in that world but I work purely instinctively I be not a scientist I could have be perhaps but I work in this world where I trust my instinct so I be a 21st century translator of technology into product that we use everyday and relate beautifully and naturally with and we should be develop thing we should be develop packaging for idea which elevate person perception and respect for the thing that we dig out of the earth and translate into product for everyday use so the water bottle I will begin with this concept of what I call dna dna design Nature Art this be the three thing that condition my world here be a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci 500 year ago before photography it show how observation curiosity and instinct work to create amazing art industrial design be the art form of the 21st century person like Leonardo there have not be many have this amazingly instinctive curiosity I work from a similar position I do not want to sound pretentious say that but this be my drawing make on a digital pad a couple of year ago well into the 21st century 500 year late it be my impression of water impressionism be the most valuable art form on the planet as we know it 100 million dollar easily for a Monet I use now a whole new process a few year ago I reinvent my process to keep up with person like Greg Lynn Thom Mayne Zaha Hadid Rem Koolhaas all this person that I think be persevere and pioneer with fantastic new idea of how to create form this be all create digitally here you see the machining the milling of a block of acrylic this be what I show to the client to say that be what I want to do at that point I do not know if that be possible at all it be a seductor but I just feel in my bone that that be possible so we go we look at the tool we look at how that be produce this be the invisible thing that you never see in you life this be the background noise of industrial design that be like a Anish Kapoor flow through a Richard Serra it be more valuable than the product in my eye I do not have one when I do make some money I will have one machine for myself this be the final product when they send it to I I think I would fail it feel like nothing it have to feel like nothing it be when I put the water in that I realize that I would put a skin on water itself it be a icon of water itself and it elevate person perception of contemporary design each bottle be different mean the water level will give you a different shape it be mass individualism from a single product it fit the hand it fit arthritic hand it fit child hand it make the product strong the tessellation it be a millefiori of idea in the future they will look like that because we need to move away from that type of polymer and use that for medical equipment and more important thing perhaps in life biopolymer this new idea for material will come into play in probably a decade it do not look as cool do it but I can live up to that I do not have a problem with that I design for that condition biopolymer it be the future I take this video in Cape Town last year this be the freaky side come out I have this special interest in thing like this which blow my mind I do not know whether to you know drop to my knee cry I do not know what I think but I just know that nature nature improve with ever great purpose that which once exist and that strangeness be a consequence of innovative thinking when I look at this thing they look pretty normal to I but this thing evolve over many year and what we be try to do I get three week to design a telephone how the hell do I do that when you get this thing that take hundred of million of year to evolve how do you condense that it come back to instinct I be not talk about design telephone that look like that and I be not look at design architecture like that I be just interested in natural growth pattern and the beautiful form that only nature really create how that flow through I and how that come out be what I be try to understand this be a scan through the human forearm it be then blow up through rapid prototyping to reveal its cellular structure I have this in my office my office be a mixture of the Natural History Museum and a NASA space lab it be a weird kind of freaky place this be one of my specimen this be make bone be make from a mixture of inorganic mineral and polymer I study cook in school for four year and in that experience which be call domestic science it be a bit of a cheap trick for I to try and get a science qualification laughter actually I put marijuana in everything I cook laughter and I have access to all the good girl it be fabulous all the guy in the rugby team could not understand anyway this be a meringue this be another sample I have a meringue be make exactly the same way in my estimation as a bone it be make from polysaccharide and proteins if you pour water on that it dissolve could we be manufacture from foodstuff in the future not a bad idea I do not know I need to talk to Janine and a few other person about that but I believe instinctively that that meringue can become something a car I do not know I be also interested in growth pattern the unbridled way that nature grow thing so you be not restrict by form at all this interrelated form they do inspire everything I do although I might end up make something incredibly simple this be a detail of a chair that I have design in magnesium it show this interlocution of element and the beauty of kind of engineering and biological thinking show pretty much as a bone structure any one of that element you could sort of hang on the wall as some kind of art object it be the world first chair make in magnesium it cost 1 7 million dollar to develop it be call go by Bernhardt USA it go into Time magazine in 2001 as the new language of the 21st century boy for somebody grow up in Wales in a little village that be enough it show how you make one holistic form like the car industry and then you break up what you need this be a absolutely beautiful way of work it be a godly way of work it be organic and it be essential it be a absolutely fat free design and when you look at it you see human being when that move into polymer you can change the elasticity the fluidity of the form this be a idea for a gas inject one piece polymer chair what nature do be it drill hole in thing it liberate form it take away anything extraneous that be what I do I make organic thing which be essential and they look funky too but I do not set out to make funky thing because I think that be a absolute disgrace I set out to look at natural form if you take the idea of fractal technology far take a membrane shrink it down constantly like nature do that could be a seat for a chair it could be a sole for a sport shoe it could be a car blend into seat wow let go for it that be the kind of stuff this be what exist in nature Observation now allow we to bring that natural process into the design process every day that be what I do this be a show that be currently on in Tokyo it be call Superliquidity it be my sculptural investigation it be like 21st century Henry Moore when you see a Henry Moore still you hair stand up there be some amazing spiritual connect if he be a car designer phew we have all be drive one in he day he be the high taxpayer in Britain that be the power of organic design it contribute immensely to we sense of be we sense of relationship with thing we sensuality and you know the sort of even the sort of socio erotic side which be very important this be my artwork this be all my process this actually be sell as artwork they be very big print but this be how I get to that object ironically that object be make by the Killarney process which be a brand new process here for the 21st century and I can hear Greg Lynn laugh he sock off as I say that I will tell you about that later when I look into this datum image I see new thing it be self inspire diatomic structure radiolaria the thing that we could not see but we can do now this again be core out they be make virtually from nothing they be make from silica why not structure from car like that Coral all this natural force take away what they do not need and they deliver maximum beauty we need to be in that realm I want to do stuff like that this be a new chair which should come on the market in September it be for a company call Moroso in Italy it be a gas inject polymer chair that hole you see there be very filter down water down version of the extremity of the diatomic structure it go with the flow of the polymer and you will see there be a image come up right now that show the full thing it be great to have company in Italy who support this way of dream if you see the shadow that come through that they be actually probably more important than the product but it be the minimum it take the core out of the back let you breathe it take away any material you do not need and it actually garner flexure too I be go to break into a dance then this be some current work I be do I be look at single surface structure and how they stretch and flow it be base on furniture typology but that be not the end motivation it be make from aluminum as oppose to aluminium and it be grow it be grow in my mind and then it be grow in term of the whole process that I go through this be two week ago in CCP in Coventry who build part for Bentleys and so on it be be build as we speak and it will be on show in Phillips next year in New York I have a big show with Phillips Auctioneers when I see this animation oh Jesus I be blow away this be what go on in my studio everyday I walk I be travel I come back some guy be get that on a computer there be this like oh my goodness so I try to create this energy of invention every day in my studio this kind of effervescent fully charge sense of soup that deliver idea single surface product Furniture a good one how you grow leg out of a surface I would love to build this one day and perhaps I would like to build it also out of flour sugar polymer wood chip I do not know human hair I do not know I would love a go at that I do not know if I just get some time that be the weird side come out again a lot of company do not understand that three week ago I be with Sony in Tokyo they say give we the dream what be we dream how do we beat Apple I say you do not copy Apple that be for sure you get into biopolymer they look straight through I what a waste anyway laughter no it be true fuck they you know I mean laughter I be deliver they be not take I have have this image 20 year I have have this image of a water droplet for 20 year sit on a hot bed that be a image of a car for I that be the car of the future it be a water droplet I have be bang on about this like I can not believe car be all wrong I be go to show you something a bit weird now they laugh everywhere over the world I show this the only place that do not laugh be Moscow Cars be make from 30 000 component how ridiculous be that could not you make that from 300 it be get a vacuum form carbon nylon pan everything holistically integrate it open and close like a bread bin there be no engine there be a solar panel on the back and there be battery in the wheel they be fit like Formula 1 you take they off you wall you plug they in off you go a three wheel car slow feminine transparent so you can see the person in there you drive different you see that thing you do you do and not anesthetize separate from life there be a hole at the front and there be a reason for that it be a city car you drive along you get out you drive on to a proboscis you get out it lift you up it present the solar panel to the sun and at night it be a street lamp applause that be what happen if you get inspire by the street lamp first and do the car second I can see this bubble with this hydrogen package float around on the ground drive by ai when I show this in South Africa everybody afterwards be go hey car on a stick like this can you imagine a car on a stick laughter if you put it next to contemporary architecture it feel totally natural to I and that be what I do with my furniture I be not put Charles Eames furniture in build anymore I be try to build furniture which fit architecture I be try to build transportation system I work on aircraft for Airbus I do all this sort of stuff try to force this natural inspire by nature dream home I be go to finish on two thing this be the stereolithography of a staircase it be a little bit of a dedication to James James Watson I build this thing for my studio it cost I 250 000 dollar to build this most person go and buy the Aston Martin I build this this be the datum that go with that incredibly complex take about two year because I be look for fat free design lean efficient thing healthy product this be build by composite it be a single element which rotate around to create a holistic element and this be a carbon fiber handrail which be only support in two place modern material allow we to do modern thing this be a shot in the studio this be how it look pretty much every day you would not want to have a fear of height come down it there be virtually no handrail it do not pass any standard laughter who care laughter and it have a internal handrail which give it its strength it be this holistic integration that be my studio it be subterranean it be in Notting Hill next to all the crap the prostitute and all that stuff it be next to David Hockney original studio it have a lighting system that change throughout the day my guy go out for lunch the door open they come back in because it be normally rain and they prefer to stay in this be my studio Elephant skull from Oxford University 1988 I buy that last year they be very difficult to find if anybody be get a whale skeleton they want to sell I I will put it in the studio so I be just go to interject a little bit with some of the thing that you will see in the video it be a homemade video make it myself at three o clock in the morning just to show you how my real world be you never see that you never see architect or designer show you they real world this be call a Plasnet it be a new bio polycarbonate chair I be do in Italy World first bamboo bike with folding handlebars we should all be ride one of this as China buy all this crappy car we should be ride thing like this counterbalance like I say it be a cross between Natural History Museum and a NASA laboratory it be full of prototype and object it be self inspirational again I mean the rare time when I be there I do enjoy it and I get lot and lot of kid come I be a contaminator for all that child of investment banker wanker sorry laughter that be a solar seed it be a concept for new architecture that thing on the top be the world first solar power garden lamp the first produce Giles Revell should be talk here today amazing photography of thing you can not see the first sculptural model I make for that thing in Tokyo lot of stuff there be a little leaf chair that golden look thing be call Leaf it be make from Kevlar on the wall be my book call supernatural which allow I to remember what I have do because I forget there be a aerate brick I do in Limoges last year in concept for New Ceramics in Architecture Gernot Oberfell work at three o clock in the morning and I do not pay overtime overtime be the passion of design so join the club or do not laughter no it be true person like Tom and Greg we be travel like you can not we fit it all in I do not know how we do it next week I be at Electrolux in Sweden then I be in Beijing on Friday you work that one out and when I see Ed photograph I think why the hell be I go to China it be true it be true because there be a soul in this whole thing we need to have a new instinct for the 21st century we need to combine all this stuff if all the person who be talk over this period work on a car together it would be a joy absolute joy so there be a new x light system I be do in Japan there be tuareg shoe from North Africa there be a kifwebe mask this be my sculpture a copper jelly mold laughter it sound like some quiz show or something do not it so it be go to end thank you James for you great inspiration thank you very much applause
