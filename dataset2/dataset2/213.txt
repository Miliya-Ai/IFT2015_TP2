one of the problem of writing and working and look at the internet be that it be very hard to separate fashion from deep change and so to start help that I want to take we back to 1835 in 1835 James Gordon Bennett find the first mass circulation newspaper in New York City and it cost about 500 dollar to start it which be about the equivalent of 10 000 dollar of today by 15 year later by 1850 do the same thing start what be experience as a mass circulation daily paper would come to cost two and a half million dollar 10 000 two and a half million 15 year that be the critical change that be be invert by the net and that be what I want to talk about today and how that relate to the emergence of social production start with newspaper what we see be high cost as a initial requirement for make information knowledge and culture which lead to a stark bifurcation between producer who have to be able to raise financial capital just like any other industrial organization and passive consumer that could choose from a certain set of thing that this industrial model could produce now the term information society information economy for a very long time have be use as the thing that come after the industrial revolution but in fact for purpose of understand what be happen today that be wrong because for 150 year we have have a information economy it be just be industrial which mean that who be produce have to have a way of raise money to pay that two and a half million dollar and later more for the telegraph and the radio transmitter and the television and eventually the mainframe and that mean they be market base or they be government own depend on what kind of system they be in and this characterize and anchor the way information and knowledge be produce for the next 150 year now let I tell you a different story around June 2002 the world of supercomputer have a bombshell the Japanese have for the first time create the fast supercomputer the NEC Earth Simulator take the primary from the U S and about two year late this by the way be measure the trillion float point operation per second that the computer capable of run sigh of relief IBM Blue Gene have just edge ahead of the NEC Earth Simulator all of this completely ignore the fact that throughout this period there be another supercomputer run in the world seti home four and a half million user around the world contribute they leftover computer cycle whenever they computer be not work by run a screen saver and together share they resource to create a massive supercomputer that NASA harness to analyze the datum come from radio telescope what this picture suggest to we be that we have get a radical change in the way information production and exchange be capitalize not that it be become less capital intensive that there be less money that be require but that the ownership of this capital the way the capitalization happen be radically distribute each of we in this advanced economy have one of this or something rather like it a computer they be not radically different from router inside the middle of the network and computation storage and communication capacity be in the hand of practically every connected person and this be the basic physical capital mean necessary for produce information knowledge and culture in the hand of something like 600 million to a billion person around the planet what this mean be that for the first time since the industrial revolution the most important mean the most important component of the core economic activity remember we be in a information economy of the most advanced economy and there more than anywhere else be in the hand of the population at large this be completely different than what we have see since the industrial revolution so we have get communication and computation capacity in the hand of the entire population and we have get human creativity human wisdom human experience the other major experience the other major input which unlike simple labor stand here turn this lever all day long be not something that be the same or fungible among person any one of you who have take someone else job or try to give yours to someone else no matter how detailed the manual you can not transmit what you know what you will intuit under a certain set of circumstance in that we be unique and each of we hold this critical input into production as we hold this machine what be the effect of this so the story that most person know be the story of free or open source software this be market share of Apache web server one of the critical application in web base communication in 1995 two group of person say wow this be really important the web we need a much good web server one be a motley collection of volunteer who just decide you know we really need this we should write one and what be we go to do with what well we be go to share it and other person will be able to develop it the other be Microsoft now if I tell you that 10 year late the motley crew of person who do not control anything that they produce acquire 20 percent of the market and be the red line it would be amazing right think of it in minivan a group of automobile engineer on they weekend be compete with Toyota Right but in fact of course the story be it be the 70 percent include the major e commerce site 70 percent of a critical application on which web base communication and application work be produce in this form in direct competition with Microsoft not in a side issue in a central strategic decision to try to capture a component of the Net Software have do this in a way that be be very visible because it be measurable but the thing to see be that this actually happen throughout the web so NASA at some point do a experiment where they take image of Mars that they be map and they say instead of have three or four fully train ph d s do this all the time let break it up into small component put it up on the web and see if person use a very simple interface will actually spend five minute here 10 minute there click after six month 85 000 person use this to generate mapping at a fast rate than the image be come in which be quote practically indistinguishable from the marking of a fully train ph d once you show it to a number of person and compute the average now if you have a little girl and she go and write to well not so little medium little try to do research on Barbie and she will come to Encarta one of the main online encyclopedia this be what you will find out about Barbie this be it there be nothing more to the definition include manufacturer plural now more commonly produce ethnically diverse doll like this black Barbie which be vastly good than what you will find in the encyclopedia com which be Barbie Klaus laughter on the other hand if they go to Wikipedia they will find a genuine article and I will not talk a lot about Wikipedia because Jimmy Wales be here but roughly equivalent to what you would find in the Britannica differently write include the controversy over body image and commercialization the claim about the way in which she be a good role model etc another portion be not only how content be produce but how relevance be produce the claim to fame of Yahoo be we hire person to look originally not anymore we hire person to look at website and tell you if they be in the index they be good this on the other hand be what 60 000 passionate volunteer produce in the Open Directory Project each one willing to spend a hour or two on something they really care about to say this be good so this be the Open Directory Project with 60 000 volunteer each one spend a little bit of time as oppose to a few hundred fully pay employee no one own it no one own the output it be free for anyone to use and it be the output of person act out of social and psychological motivation to do something interesting this be not only outside of business when you think of what be the critical innovation of Google the critical innovation be outsource the one most important thing the decision about what be relevant to the community of the web as a whole do whatever they want to do so page rank the critical innovation here be instead of we engineer or we person say which be the most relevant we be go to go out and count what you person out there on the web for whatever reason vanity pleasure produce link and tie to each other we be go to count that and count they up and again here you see Barbie com but also very quickly Adiosbarbie com the body image for every size a contest cultural object which you will not find anywhere soon on overture which be the classic market base mechanism whoever pay the most be high on the list so all of that be in the creation of content of relevance basic human expression but remember the computer be also physical just physical material we pc we share they together we also see this in wireless it use to be wireless be one person own the license they transmit in a area and it have to be decide whether they would be license or base on property what we be see now be that computer and radio be become so sophisticated that we be develop algorithm to let person own machine like Wi Fi device and overlay they with a sharing protocol that would allow a community like this to build its own wireless broadband network simply from the simple principle when I be listen when I be not use I can help you transfer you message and when you be not use you will help I transfer yours and this be not a idealized version this be work model that at least in some place in the United States be be implement at least for public security if in 1999 I tell you let build a data storage and retrieval system it be get to store terabyte it be get to be available 24 hour a day seven day a week it be get to be available from anywhere in the world it have to support over 100 million user at any given moment it be get to be robust to attack include close the main index inject malicious file armed seizure of some major node you would say that would take year it would take million but of course what I be describe be p2p file share right we always think of it as steal music but fundamentally it be a distribute datum storage and retrieval system where person for very obvious reason be willing to share they bandwidth and they storage to create something so essentially what we be see be the emergence of a fourth transactional framework it use to be that there be two primary dimension along which you could divide thing they could be market base or non market base they could be decentralize or centralize the price system be a market base and decentralize system if thing work good because you actually have somebody organize they you have firm if you want to be in the market or you have government or sometimes large non profit in the non market it be too expensive to have decentralize social production to have decentralize action in society that be not about society itself that be in fact economic but what we be see now be the emergence of this fourth system of social sharing and exchange not that it be the first time that we do nice thing to each other or for each other as social being we do it all the time it be that it be the first time that it be have major economic impact what characterize they be decentralize authority you do not have to ask permission as you do in a property base system may I do this it be open for anyone to create and innovate and share if they want to by themselves or with other because property be one mechanism of coordination but it be not the only one instead what we see be social framework for all of the critical thing that we use property and contract in the market information flow to decide what be interesting problem who be available and good for something motivation structure remember money be not always the good motivator if you leave a 50 check after dinner with friend you do not increase the probability of be invite back and if dinner be not entirely obvious think of sex laughter it also require certain new organizational approach and in particular what we have see be task organization you have to hire person who know what they be do you have to hire they to spend a lot of time now take the same problem chunk it into little module and motivation become trivial five minute instead of watch tv five minute I will spend just because it be interesting just because it be fun just because it give I a certain sense of meaning or in place that be more involved like Wikipedia give I a certain set of social relation so a new social phenomenon be emerge it be create and it be most visible when we see it as a new form of competition peer to peer network assault the recording industry free and open source software take market share from Microsoft Skype potentially threaten traditional telecom Wikipedia compete with online encyclopedia but it be also a new source of opportunity for business as you see a new set of social relation and behavior emerge you have new opportunity some of they be toolmaker instead of build well behave appliance thing that you know what they will do in advance you begin to build more open tool there be a new set of value a new set of thing person value you build platform for self expression and collaboration like Wikipedia like the Open Directory Project you be begin to build platform and you see that as a model and you see surfer person who see this happen and in some sense build it into a supply chain which be a very curious one right you have a belief stuff will flow out of connected human being that will give I something I can use and I be go to contract with someone I will deliver something base on what happen it be very scary that be what Google do essentially that be what IBM do in software service and they have do reasonably well so social production be a real fact not a fad it be the critical long term shift cause by the internet social relation and exchange become significantly more important than they ever be as a economic phenomenon in some context it be even more efficient because of the quality of the information the ability to find the good person the low transaction cost it be sustainable and grow fast but and this be the dark lining it be threaten by in the same way that it threaten the incumbent industrial system so next time you open the paper and you see a intellectual property decision a telecoms decision it be not about something small and technical it be about the future of the freedom to be as social be with each other and the way information knowledge and culture will be produce because it be in this context that we see a battle over how easy or hard it will be for the industrial information economy to simply go on as it go or for the new model of production to begin to develop alongside that industrial model and change the way we begin to see the world and report what it be that we see thank you
