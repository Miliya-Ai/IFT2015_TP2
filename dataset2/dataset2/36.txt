a public Dewey long ago observe be constitute through discussion and debate if we be to call the tyranny of assumption into question and avoid doxa the realm of the unquestioned then we must be willing to subject we own assumption to debate and discussion it be in this spirit that I join into a discussion of one of the critical issue of we time namely how to mobilize different form of capital for the project of state building to put the assumption very clearly capitalism after 150 year have become acceptable and so have democracy if we look in the world of 1945 and look at the map of capitalist economy and democratic polity they be the rare exception not the norm the question now however be both about which form of capitalism and which type of democratic participation but we must acknowledge that this moment have bring about a rare consensus of assumption and that provide the ground for a type of action because consensus of each moment allow we to act and it be necessary no matter how fragile or how provisional we consensus to be able to move forward but the majority of the world neither benefit from capitalism nor from democratic system most of the globe experience the state as repressive as a organization that be concerned about denial of right about denial of justice rather than provision of it and in term of experience of capitalism there be two aspect that the rest of the globe experience first extractive industry blood diamond smuggle emerald timber that be cut right from under the poor second be technical assistance and technical assistance might shock you but it be the bad form of today of the ugly face of the developed world to the develop country ten of billion of dollar be supposedly spend on building capacity with person who be pay up to 1 500 dollar a day who be incapable of think creatively or organically next assumption and of course the event of July 7 I express my deep sympathy and before that September 11 have remind we we do not live in three different world we live in one world but that be easily say but we be not deal with the implication of the one world that we be live in and that be that if we want to have one world this one world can not be base on huge pocket of exclusion and then inclusion for some we must now finally come to think about the premise of a truly global world in relationship to the regime of right and responsibility and accountability that be truly global in scope otherwise we will be miss this open moment in history where we have a consensus on both the form of politics and the form of economics what be one of this organization to pick we have three critical term economy civil society and the state I will not deal with that first two except to say that uncritical transfer of assumption from one context to another can only make for disaster Economics teach in most of the elite university be practically useless in my context my country be dominate by drug economy and a mafia Textbook economics do not work in my context and I have very few recommendation from anybody as to how to put together a legal economy the poverty of we knowledge must become the first basis of move forward and not imposition of the framework that work on the basis of mathematical modeling for which I have enormous respect my colleague at Johns Hopkins be among the good second instead of debate endlessly about what be the structure of the state why do not we simplify and say what be a series of function that the state in the 21st century must perform Clare Lockhart and I be write a book on this we hope to share that much widely with and third be that we could actually construct a index to measure comparatively how well this function that we would agree on be be perform in different place so what be this function we propose 10 and it be legitimate monopoly of means of violence administrative control management of public finances investment in human capital provision of citizenship right provision of infrastructure management of the tangible and intangible asset of the state through regulation creation of the market international agreement include public borrowing and then most importantly rule of law I will not elaborate I hope the question will give I a opportunity this be a feasible goal basically because contrary to widespread assumption I would argue that we know how to do this who would have imagine that Germany would be either united or democratic today if you look at it from the perspective of Oxford of 1943 but person at Oxford prepare for a democratic Germany and engage in plan and there be lot of other example now in order to do this and this bring this group we have to rethink the notion of capital the least important form of capital in this project be financial capital money money be not capital in most of the develop country it be just cash because it lack the institutional organizational managerial form to turn it into capital and what be require be a combination of physical capital institutional capital human capital and security of course be critical but so be information now the issue that should concern we here and that be the challenge that I would like to pose to this group be again it take 16 year in you country to produce somebody with a b s degree it take 20 year to produce somebody with a ph d the first challenge be to rethink fundamentally the issue of the time do we need to repeat the modality that we have inherit we educational system be inherit from the 19th century what be it that we need to do fundamentally to be engage in a project that capital formation be rapid the absolute majority of the world population be below 20 and they be grow large and fast they need different way of be approach different way of be enfranchise different way of be skilled and that be the first thing Second be you be problem solver but you be not engage you global responsibility you have stay away from the problem of corruption you only want clean environment in which to function but if you do not think through the problem of corruption who will you stay away from design for development you be great designer but you design be selfish it be for you own immediate use the world in which I operate operate with design regard road or dam or provision of electricity that have not be revisit in 60 year this be not right it require think but particularly what we need more than anything else from this group be you imagination to be bring to bear on problem the way a meme be suppose to work as the work on paradigm long time ago show Thomas Kuhn work it be in the intersection of idea that new development true breakthrough occur and I hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state and development and the empowerment of the majority of the world poor through this mean thank you applause Chris Anderson so Ashraf until recently you be the finance minister of Afghanistan a country right at the middle of much of the world agenda be the country go to make it will democracy flourish what scare you most Ashraf Ghani what scare I most be be you lack of you engagement laughter you ask I you know I always give the unconventional answer no but seriously the issue of Afghanistan first have to be see as at least a 10 to 20 year perspective today the world of globalization be on speed time have be compress and space do not exist for most person but in my world you know when I go back to Afghanistan after 23 year space have expand every conceivable form of infrastructure have break down I ride travel travel between two city that use to take three hour now take 12 so the first be when the scale be that we need to recognize that just the simple thing that be infrastructure it take six year to deliver infrastructure in we world any meaningful sort of thing but the modality of attention or what be happen today what be happen tomorrow Second be when a country have be subject to one of the most immense brutal form of exercise of power we have the Red Army for 10 continuous year 110 000 strong literally terrorize the sky every Afghan see the sky as a source of fear we be bomb practically out of existence then ten of thousand of person be train in terrorism from all side the United States Great Britain join for instance Egyptian intelligence service to train thousand of person in resistance and urban terrorism how to turn a bicycle into a instrument of terror how to turn a donkey a carthorse anything and the Russian equally so when violence erupt in a country like Afghanistan it be because of that legacy but we have to understand that we have be incredibly lucky I mean I really can not believe how lucky I be here stand in front of you speak when I join as finance minister I think that the chance of my live more than three year would not be more than five percent that be the risk they be worth it I think we can make it and the reason we can make it be because of the person you see because I mean I give you one statistic 91 percent of the man in Afghanistan 86 percent of the woman listen to at least three radio station a day in term of they discourse in term of they sophistication of knowledge of the world I think that I would dare say they be much more sophisticated than rural American with college degree and the bulk of European because the world matter to they and what be they predominant concern Abandonment Afghan have become deeply internationalist you know when I go back in December of 2001 I have absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan government because I have live as a nationalist and I tell they my person with the American here separate yes I have a advisory position with the U N I go through 10 Afghan province very rapidly and everybody be tell I it be a different world you know they engage they see engagement global engagement as absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary person and the thing that the ordinary Afghan be most concerned with be Clare Lockhart be here so I will recite a discussion she have with a illiterate woman in Northern Afghanistan and that woman say she do not care whether she have food on she table what she worry about be whether there be a plan for the future where she child could really have a different life that give I hope CA how be Afghanistan go to provide alternative income to the many person who be make they living off the drug trade ag certainly well the first be instead of send a billion dollar on drug eradication and pay it to a couple of security company they should give this hundred billion dollar to 50 of the most critically innovative company in the world to ask they to create one million job the key to the drug eradication be job look there be a very little known fact country that have a legal average income per capita of 1 000 dollar do not produce drug second textile trade be the key not aid the U S and Europe should give we a zero percent tariff the textile industry be incredibly mobile if you want we to be able to compete with China and to attract investment we could probably attract four to six billion dollar quite easily in the textile sector if there be zero tariff would create the type of job cotton do not compete with opium a t shirt do and we need to understand it be the value chain look the ordinary Afghan be sick and tired of hear about microcredit it be important but what the ordinary woman and man who engage in micro production want be global access they do not want to sell to the charity bazaar that be only for foreigner and the same bloody shirt embroider time and again what we want be a partnership with the Italian design firm yeah we have the good embroiderer in the world why can not we do what be do with northern Italy with the put out system so I think economically the critical issue really be to now think through and what I will say here be that aid do not work you know the aid system be break the aid system do not have the knowledge the vision the ability I be all for it after all I raise a lot of it yeah to be exact you know I manage to persuade the world that they have to give my country 27 5 billion they do not want to give we the money CA and it still do not work AG No it be not that it do not work it be that a dollar of private investment in my judgment be equal at least to 20 dollar of aid in term of the dynamic that it generate second be that one dollar of aid could be 10 cent it could be 20 cent or it could be four dollar it depend on what form it come what degree of conditionality be attach to it you know the aid system at first be design to benefit entrepreneur of the develop country not to generate growth in the poor country and this be again one of that assumption the way car seat be a assumption that we have inherit in government and door you would think that the US government would not think that American firm need subsidize to function in develop country provide advice but they do there be a entire weight of history vis a vis aid that now need to be reexamine if the goal be to build state that can credibly take care of themselves and I be put that proposition equally you know I be very harsh on my counterpart aid must end in each country in a definable period and every year there must be progress on mobilization of domestic revenue and generation of the economy unless that kind of compact be enter into you will not be able to sustain the consensus
