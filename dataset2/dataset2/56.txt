if you have not order yet I generally find the rigatoni with the spicy tomato sauce go best with disease of the small intestine laughter so sorry it just feel like I should be do stand up up here because of the setting no what I want to do be take you back to 1854 in London for the next few minute and tell the story in brief of this outbreak which in many way I think help create the world that we live in today and particularly the kind of city that we live in today this period in 1854 in the middle part of the 19th century in London history be incredibly interesting for a number of reason but I think the most important one be that London be this city of 2 5 million person and it be the large city on the face of the planet at that point but it be also the large city that have ever be build and so the Victorian be try to live through and simultaneously invent a whole new scale of live this scale of live that we you know now call metropolitan living and it be in many way at this point in the mid 1850 a complete disaster they be basically a city live with a modern kind of industrial metropolis with a Elizabethan public infrastructure so person for instance just to gross you out for a second have cesspool of human waste in they basement like a foot to two foot deep and they would just kind of throw the bucket down there and hope that it would somehow go away and of course it never really would go away and all of this stuff basically have accumulate to the point where the city be incredibly offensive to just walk around in it be a amazingly smelly city not just because of the cesspool but also the sheer number of livestock in the city would shock person not just the horse but person have cow in they Attic that they would use for milk that they would hoist up there and keep they in the Attic until literally they milk run out and they die and then they would drag they off to the bone boiler down the street so you would just walk around London at this point and just be overwhelmed with this stench and what end up happen be that a entire emerge public health system become convinced that it be the smell that be kill everybody that be create this disease that would wipe through the city every three or four year and cholera be really the great killer of this period it arrive in London in 1832 and every four or five year another epidemic would take 10 000 20 000 person in London and throughout the U K and so the authority become convinced that this smell be this problem we have to get rid of the smell and so in fact they concoct a couple of early you know found public health intervention in the system of the city one of which be call the Nuisances Act which they get everybody as far as they could to empty out they cesspool and just pour all that waste into the river because if we get it out of the street it will smell much good and oh right we drink from the river so what end up happen actually be they end up increase the outbreak of cholera because as we now know cholera be actually in the water it be a waterborne disease not something that be in the air it be not something you smell or inhale it be something you ingest and so one of the founding moment of public health in the 19th century effectively poison the water supply of London much more effectively than any modern day bioterrorist could have ever dream of do so this be the state of London in 1854 and in the middle of all this carnage and offensive condition and in the midst of all this scientific confusion about what be actually kill person it be a very talented classic 19th century multi disciplinarian name John Snow who be a local doctor in Soho in London who have be argue for about four or five year that cholera be in fact a waterborne disease and have basically convinced nobody of this the public health authority have largely ignore what he have to say and he would make the case in a number of paper and do a number of study but nothing have really stuck and part of what be so interesting about this story to I be that in some way it be a great case study in how cultural change happen how a good idea eventually come to win out over much bad idea and Snow labor for a long time with this great insight that everybody ignore and then on one day August 28th of 1854 a young child a five month old girl whose first name we do not know we know she only as Baby Lewis somehow contract cholera come down with cholera at 40 Broad Street you can not really see it in this map but this be the map that become the central focus in the second half of my book it be in the middle of Soho in this work class neighborhood this little girl become sick and it turn out that the cesspool that they still continue to have despite the Nuisances Act border on a extremely popular water pump local watering hole that be well know for the good water in all of Soho that all the resident from Soho and the surround neighborhood would go to and so this little girl inadvertently end up contaminate the water in this popular pump and one of the most terrifying outbreak in the history of England erupt about two or three day later literally 10 percent of the neighborhood die in seven day and much more would have die if person have not flee after the initial outbreak kick in so it be this incredibly terrifying event you have this scene of entire family die over the course of 48 hour of cholera alone in they one room apartment in they little flat just a extraordinary terrifying scene Snow live near there hear about the outbreak and in this amazing act of courage go directly into the belly of the beast because he think a outbreak that concentrate could actually potentially end up convincing person that in fact the real menace of cholera be in the water supply and not in the air he suspect a outbreak that concentrate would probably involve a single point source one single thing that everybody be go to because it do not have the traditional slow path of infection that you might expect and so he go right in there and start interview person he eventually enlist the help of this amazing other figure who be kind of the other protagonist of the book this guy Henry Whitehead who be a local minister who be not at all a man of science but be incredibly socially connect he know everybody in the neighborhood and he manage to track down Whitehead do many of the case of person who have drunk water from the pump or who have not drunk water from the pump and eventually Snow make a map of the outbreak he find increasingly that person who drink from the pump be get sick person who have not drunk from the pump be not get sick and he think about represent that as a kind of a table of statistics of person live in different neighborhood person who have not you know percentage of person who have not but eventually he hit upon the idea that what he need be something that you could see something that would take in a sense a high level view of all this activity that have be happen in the neighborhood and so he create this map which basically end up represent all the death in the neighborhood as black bar at each address and you can see in this map the pump right at the center of it and you can see that one of the residence down the way have about 15 person dead and the map be actually a little bit big as you get further and further away from the pump the death begin to grow less and less frequent and so you can see this something poisonous emanate out of this pump that you could see in a glance and so with the help of this map and with the help of more evangelizing that he do over the next few year and that Whitehead do eventually actually the authority slowly start to come around it take much long than sometimes we like to think in this story but by 1866 when the next big cholera outbreak come to London the authority have be convince in part because of this story in part because of this map that in fact the water be the problem and they have already start build the sewer in London and they immediately go to this outbreak and they tell everybody to start boil they water and that be the last time that London have see a cholera outbreak since so part of this story I think well it be a terrifying story it be a very dark story and it be a story that continue on in many of the develop city of the world it be also a story really that be fundamentally optimistic which be to say that it be possible to solve this problem if we listen to reason if we listen to the kind of wisdom of this kind of map if we listen to person like Snow and Whitehead if we listen to the local who understand what be go on in this kind of situation and what it end up do be make the idea of large scale metropolitan live a sustainable one when person be look at 10 percent of they neighborhood die in the space of seven day there be a widespread consensus that this could not go on that person be not mean to live in city of 2 5 million person but because of what Snow do because of this map because of the whole series of reform that happen in the wake of this map we now take for grant that city have 10 million person city like this one be in fact sustainable thing we do not worry that New York City be go to collapse in on itself quite the way that you know Rome do and be 10 percent of its size in 100 year or 200 year and so that in a way be the ultimate legacy of this map it be a map of death that end up create a whole new way of life the life that we be enjoy here today thank you very much
