thank you I have to tell you I be both challenge and excite my excitement be I get a chance to give something back my challenge be the short seminar I usually do be 50 hour laughter I be not exaggerate I do weekend I do more obviously I also coach person but I be into immersion because how do you learn language not just by learn principle you get in it and you do it so often that it become real the bottom line of why I be here besides be a crazy mofo be that I be not here to motivate you you do not need that obviously often that be what person think I do and it be the furth thing from it what happen though be person say to I I do not need any motivation but that be not what I do I be the why guy I want to know why you do what you do what be you motive for action what be it that drive you in you life today not 10 year ago be you run the same pattern because I believe that the invisible force of internal drive activate be the most important thing I be here because I believe emotion be the force of life all of we here have great mind most of we here have great mind right we all know how to think with we mind we can rationalize anything we can make anything happen I agree with what be describe a few day ago that person work in they self interest but we know that that be bullshit at time you do not work in you self interest all the time because when emotion come into it the wiring change in the way it function so it be wonderful to think intellectually about how the life of the world be especially that who be very smart can play this game in we head but I really want to know what be drive you what I would like to invite you to do by the end of this talk be explore where you be today for two reason one so that you can contribute more and two that hopefully we can not just understand other person more but appreciate they more and create the kind of connection that can stop some of the challenge that we face today they be only go to get magnify by the very technology that connect we because it be make we intersect that intersection do not always create a view of everybody now understand everybody and everybody appreciate everybody I have have a obsession basically for 30 year what make the difference in the quality of person life what in they performance I get hire to produce the result now I have do it for 30 year I get the phone call when the athlete be burn down on national television and they be ahead by five stroke and now they can not get back on the course I have get to do something right now or nothing matter I get the phone call when the child be go to commit suicide I have get to do something in 29 year I be very grateful to tell you I have never lose one it do not mean I will not some day but I have not yet the reason be a understanding of this human need when I get that call about performance that be one thing how do you make a change I be also look to see what be shape the person ability to contribute to do something beyond themselves maybe the real question be I look at life and say there be two master lesson one be there be the science of achievement which almost everyone here have master amazingly how do you take the invisible and make it visible how do you make you dream happen you business you contribution to society money whatever you body you family the other lesson that be rarely master be the art of fulfillment because science be easy right we know the rule you write the code and you get the result once you know the game you just up the ante do not you but when it come to fulfillment that be a art the reason be it be about appreciation and contribution you can only feel so much by yourself I have have a interesting laboratory to try to answer the real question how somebody be life change if you look at they like that person that you have give everything to like all the resource they say they need you give not a 100 dollar computer but the good computer you give they love joy be there to comfort they that person very often you know some of they end up the rest of they life with all this love education money and background go in and out of rehab some person have be through ultimate pain psychologically sexually spiritually emotionally abuse and not always but often they become some of the person that contribute the most to society the question we have get to ask ourselves really be what be it what be it that shape we we live in a therapy culture most of we do not do that but the culture a therapy culture the mindset that we be we past and you would not be in this room if you buy that but most of society think biography be destiny the past equal the future of course it do if you live there but what we know and what we have to remind ourselves because you can know something intellectually and then not use it not apply it we have get to remind ourselves that decision be the ultimate power when you ask person have you fail to achieve something significant in you life say aye audience aye tr thanks for the interaction on a high level there but if you ask person why do not you achieve something somebody who be work for you or a partner or even yourself when you fail to achieve what be the reason person say what do they tell you do not have the knowledge do not have the money do not have the time do not have the technology I do not have the right manager Al Gore Supreme Court TR the Supreme Court laughter applause cheer applause continue tr and applause what do all that include the Supreme Court have in common laughter they be a claim to you miss resource and they may be accurate you may not have the money or the Supreme Court but that be not the define factor applause laughter and you correct I if I be wrong the define factor be never resource it be resourcefulness and what I mean specifically rather than just some phrase be if you have emotion human emotion something that I experience from you the day before yesterday at a level that be as profound as I have ever experience and I believe with that emotion you would have beat he ass and win audience yeah applause cheer how easy for I to tell he what he should do laughter idiot Robbins but I know when we watch the debate at that time there be emotion that block person ability to get this man intellect and capacity and the way that it come across to some person on that day because I know person that want to vote in you direction and do not and I be upset but there be emotion there do you know what I be talk about say aye audience aye tr so emotion be it and if we get the right emotion we can get ourselves to do anything if you be creative playful fun enough can you get through to anybody yes or no if you do not have the money but you be creative and determine you find the way this be the ultimate resource but this be not the story that person tell we they tell we a bunch of different story they tell we we do not have the resource but ultimately if you take a look here they say what be all the reason they have not accomplish that he be break my pattern that son of a bitch laughter but I appreciate the energy I will tell you that laughter what determine you resource we have say decision shape destiny which be my focus here if decision shape destiny what determine it be three decision what will you focus on you have to decide what you be go to focus on consciously or unconsciously the minute you decide to focus you must give it a meaning and that mean produce emotion be this the end or the beginning be God punish I or reward I or be this the roll of the dice a emotion create what we be go to do or the action so think about you own life the decision that have shape you destiny and that sound really heavy but in the last five or 10 year have there be some decision that if you would make a different decision you life would be completely different how many can think about it well or badly say aye audience aye so the bottom line be maybe it be where to go to work and you meet the love of you life there a career decision I know the Google genius I see here I mean I understand that they decision be to sell they technology what if they make that decision versus to build they own culture how would the world or they life be different they impact the history of we world be this decision when a woman stand up and say no I will not go to the back of the bus she do not just affect she life that decision shape we culture or someone stand in front of a tank or be in a position like Lance Armstrong you have get testicular cancer that be pretty tough for any male especially if you ride a bike laughter you have get it in you brain you have get it in you lung but what be he decision of what to focus on different than most person what do it mean it be not the end it be the beginning he go off and win seven championship he never once win before the cancer because he get emotional fitness psychological strength that be the difference in human being that I have see of the three million I have be around in my lab I have have three million person from 80 country over the last 29 year and after a while pattern become obvious you see that South America and Africa may be connect in a certain way right other say oh that sound ridiculous it be simple so what shape Lance what shape you two invisible force very quickly one state we all have have time you do something and after you think to yourself I can not believe I say or do that that be so stupid who be be there say aye audience aye or after you do something you go that be I laughter it be not you ability it be you state you model of the world be what shape you long term you model of the world be the filter that be what be shape we it make person make decision to influence somebody we need to know what already influence they it be make up of three part first what be you target what be you after it be not you desire you can get you desire or goal who have ever get a goal or desire and think be this all there be say aye audience aye it be need we have I believe there be six human need second once you know what the target that be drive you be and you uncover it for the truth you do not form it then you find out what be you map what be the belief system that tell you how to get that need some person think the way to get they be to destroy the world some person to build create something love someone there be the fuel you pick so very quickly six need let I tell you what they be first one certainty this be not goal or desire this be universal everyone need certainty they can avoid pain and at least be comfortable now how do you get it control everybody develop a skill give up smoke a cigarette and if you get totally certain ironically even though we need that you be not certain about you health or you child or money if you be not sure the ceiling will hold up you will not listen to any speaker while we go for certainty differently if we get total certainty we get what what do you feel if you be certain you know what will happen when and how it will happen what would you feel bored out of you mind so God in she infinite wisdom give we a second human need which be uncertainty we need variety we need surprise how many of you here love surprise say aye audience aye TR Bullshit you like the surprise you want the one you do not want you call problem but you need they so variety be important have you ever rent a video or a film that you have already see who be do this get a fucking life laughter why be you do it you be certain it be good because you read or see it before but you be hope it be be long enough you have forget and there be variety third human need critical significance we all need to feel important special unique you can get it by make more money or be more spiritual you can do it by get yourself in a situation where you put more tattoo and earring in place human do not want to know whatever it take the fast way to do this if you have no background no culture no belief and resource or resourcefulness be violence if I put a gun to you head and I live in the hood instantly I be significant zero to 10 how high 10 how certain am I that you be go to respond to I 10 how much uncertainty who know what be go to happen next kind of exciting like climb up into a cave and do that stuff all the way down there total variety and uncertainty and it be significant be not it so you want to risk you life for it so that be why violence have always be around and will be around unless we have a consciousness change as a species you can get significance a million way but to be significant you have get to be unique and different here be what we really need connection and love fourth need we all want it most settle for connection love too scary who here have be hurt in a intimate relationship if you do not raise you hand you have have other shit too and you be go to get hurt again be not you glad you come to this positive visit here be what be true we need it we can do it through intimacy friendship prayer through walk in nature if nothing else work for you do not get a cat get a dog because if you leave for two minute it be like you have be go six month when you come back 5 minute late this first four need every human find a way to meet even if you lie to yourself you need to have split personality I call the first four need the need of the personality the last two be the need of the spirit and this be where fulfillment come you will not get it from the first four you will figure a way smoke drink do whatever meet the first four but number five you must grow we all know the answer if you do not grow you be what if a relationship or business be not grow if you be not grow do not matter how much money or friend you have how many love you you feel like hell and I believe the reason we grow be so we have something to give of value because the sixth need be to contribute beyond ourselves because we all know corny as that sound the secret to live be give we all know life be not about I it be about we this culture know that this room know that it be exciting when you see Nicholas talk about he 100 computer the most exciting thing be here be a genius but he be get a call now you can feel the difference in he and it be beautiful and that call can touch other person my life be touch because when I be 11 year old Thanksgiving no money no food we be not go to starve but my father be totally mess up my mom be let he know how bad he mess up and somebody come to the door and deliver food my father make three decision I know what they be briefly he focus be this be charity what do it mean I be worthless what do I have to do leave my family which he do it be one of the most painful experience of life my three decision give I a different path I set focus on there be food what a concept laughter but this be what change my life shape I as a human being somebody gift I do not even know who it be my father always say no one give a shit and now somebody I do not know they be not ask for anything just give we food look out for we it make I believe this that stranger care and that make I decide if stranger care about I and my family I care about they I be go to do something to make a difference so when I be 17 I go out on Thanksgiving it be my target for year to have enough money to feed two family the most fun and move thing I ever do in my life next year I do four then eight I do not tell anybody what I be do I be not do it for brownie point but after eight I think I could use some help so I go out get my friend involve then I grow company get 11 and I build the foundation 18 year later I be proud to tell you last year we feed 2 million person in 35 country through we foundation all during the holiday Thanksgiving Christmas in different country around the world applause thank you I do not tell you that to brag but because I be proud of human being because they get excited to contribute once they have have the chance to experience it not talk about it so finally I be about out of time the target that shape you here be what be different about person we have the same need but be you a certainty freak be that what you value most or uncertainty this man could not be a certainty freak if he climb through that cave be you drive by significance or love we all need all six but what you lead system be tilt you in a different direction and as you move in a direction you have a destination or destiny the second piece be the map the operating system tell you how to get there and some person map be I be go to save life even if I die for other person and they be a fireman and somebody else say I be go to kill person to do it they be try to meet the same need of significance they want to honor God or honor they family but they have a different map and there be seven different belief I can not go through they because I be do the last piece be emotion one of the part of the map be like time some person idea of a long time be 100 year somebody else be three second which be what I have and the last one I have already mention that fall to you if you have get a target and a map I can not use Google because I love Macs and they have not make it good for Macs yet so if you use MapQuest how many have make this fatal mistake of use it you use this thing and you do not get there imagine if you belief guarantee you can never get to where you want to go laughter the last thing be emotion here be what I will tell you about emotion there be 6 000 emotion that we have word for in the English language which be just a linguistic representation that change by language but if you dominant emotion if I have 20 000 person or 1 000 and I have they write down all the emotion that they experience in a average week and I give they as long as they need and on one side they write empower emotion the other disempower guess how many emotion they experience less than 12 and half of that make they feel like shit they have six good feeling happy happy excited oh shit frustrated frustrated overwhelmed depressed how many of you know somebody who no matter what happen find a way to get piss off laughter or no matter what happen they find a way to be happy or excited how many of you know somebody like this when 9 11 happen
