I dabble in design I be a curator of architecture and design I happen to be at the Museum of Modern Art but what we be go to talk about today be really design really good designer be like sponge they really be curious and absorb every kind of information that come they way and transform it so that it can be use by person like we and so that give I a opportunity because every design show that I curate kind of look at a different world and it be great because it seem like every time I change job and what I be go to do today be I be go to give you a preview of the next exhibition that I be work on which be call design and the Elastic mind the world that I decide to focus on this particular time be the world of science and the world of technology technology always come into play when design be involve but science do a little less but designer be great at take big revolution that happen and transform they so that we can use they and this be what this exhibition look at if you think about you life today you go every day through many different scale many different change of rhythm and pace you work over different time zone you talk to very different person you multitask we all know it and we do it kind of automatically some of the mind in this audience be super elastic other be a little slow other have a few stretch mark but nonetheless this be a quite exceptional audience from that viewpoint other person be not as elastic I can not get my father in Italy to work on the internet he do not want to put high speed internet at home and that be because there be some little bit of fear little bit of resistance or just clog mechanism so designer work on this particular malaise that we have this kind of discomfort that we have and try to make life easy for we elasticity of mind be something that we really need you know we really need we really cherish and we really work on and this exhibition be about the work of designer that help we be more elastic and also of designer that really work on this elasticity as a opportunity and one last thing be that it be not only designer but it be also scientist and before I launch into the display of some of the slide and into the preview I would like to point out this beautiful detail about scientist and design you can say that the relationship between science and design go back century you can of course talk about Leonardo da Vinci and many other Renaissance man and woman and there be a gigantic history behind it but accord to a really great science historian you might know Peter Galison he teach at Harvard what nanotechnology in particular and quantum physics have bring to designer be this renew interest this real passion for design so basically the idea of be able to build thing bottom up atom by atom have make they all into tinkerer and all of a sudden scientist be seek designer just like designer be seek scientist it be a brand new love affair that we be try to cultivate at MOMA together with Adam Bly who be the founder of seed magazine that be now a multimedia company you might know it we find about a year ago a monthly salon for designer and scientist and it be quite beautiful and Keith have come and also Jonathan have come and many other and it be great because at the beginning be this apology f you know scientist would tell designer you know I do not know what style be I be not really elegant and designer would like oh I do not know how to do a equation I do not understand what you be say and then all of a sudden they really start talk each other language and now we be already at the point that they collaborate Paul Steinhardt a physicist from New York and Aranda Lasch architect collaborate in a installation in London at the Serpentine and it be really interesting to see how this happen the exhibition will talk about the work of both designer and scientist and show how they be present the possibility of the future to we I be show to you different section of the show right now just to give you a taste of it Nanophysics and nanotechnology for instance have really open the designer mind in this case I be show more the designer work because they be the one that have really be stimulate a lot of the object in the show be concept not object that exist already but what you be look at here be the work of some scientist from UCLA this kind of alphabet soup be a new way to mark proteins not only by color but literally by alphabet letter so they construct it and they can construct all kind of formsat the nanoscale this be the work of design student from the Royal College of Arts in London that have be work together with they tutor Tony Dunne and with a bunch of scientist around Great Britain on the possibility of nanotechnology for design in the future new sense element on the body you can grow hair on you nail and therefore grab some of the particle from another person they seem very very obsessed with find out more about the ideal mate so they be work on enhance everything touch smell everything they can in order to find the perfect mate very interesting this be a typeface designer from Israel who have design he call they typosperma he be think of course it be all a concept of inject typeface into spermatozoon I do not know how to say it in English spermatazoi in order to make they become to almost have a song or a whole poem write with every ejaculation laughter I tell you designer be quite fantastic you know so tissue design in this case too you have a mixture of scientist and designer this here be part of the same lab at the Royal College of Arts the rca be really quite a amazing school from that viewpoint one of the assignment for a year be to work with in vitro meat you know that already you can grow meat in vitro in Australia they do it this research company call SymbioticA but the problem be that it be a really ugly patty and so the assignment to the student be how should the steak of tomorrow be when you do not have to kill cow and it can have any shape what should it be like so this particular student James King go around the beautiful English countryside pick the good good cow that he could see and then put she in the mri machine then he take the scan of the good organ and make the meat of course this be do with a Japanese resin food maker but you know in the future it could be make good which reproduce the good mri scan of the good cow he could find instead this element here be much more banal something that you know can be do already be to grow bone tissue so that you can make a wedding ring out of the bone tissue of you love one literally so this be indeed make of human bone tissue this be symbiotica and they have be work they be the first one to do this in vitro meat and now they have also do a in vitro coat a leather coat it be miniscule but it be a real coat it be shape like one so we will be able to really not have any excuse to be wear everything leather in the future one of the most important topic of the show you know as anything in we life today we can look at it from many many different viewpoint and at different level one of the most interesting and most important concept be the idea of scale we change scale very often we change resolution of screen and we be not really fazed by it we do it very comfortably so you go even in the exhibition from the idea of nanotechnology and the nanoscale to the manipulation of really great amount of datum the mapping and tagging of the universe and of the world in this particular case a section will be devote to information design you see here the work of Ben Fry this be human vs Chimps the few chromosome that distinguish we from chimp it be a beautiful visualization that he do for seed magazine and here be the whole code of Pac Man visualize with all the go to go back to also make into a beautiful choreography and then also graph by scientist this beautiful diagraph of protein homology scientist be start to also consider aesthetics we be discuss with Keith Shrubb this morning the fact that many scientist tend not to use anything beautiful in they presentation otherwise they be afraid of be consider dumb blonde so they pick the bad background from any kind of powerpoint presentation the bad typeface it be only recently that this kind of marriage between design and science be produce some of the first pretty if we can say so scientific presentation another aspect of contemporary design that I think be mind open promising and will really be the future of design be the idea of collective design you know the whole XO laptop from one laptop per child be base on the idea of collaboration and mash and networking so the more the merry the more computer the strong the signal and child work on the interface so that it be all base on do thing together task together so the idea of collective design be something that will become even big in the future and this be choose as a example relate to the idea of collective design and to the new balance between the individual and the collectiveness collectivity be the idea of existence maximum that be a term that I coin a few year ago while I be think of how pressed we be together and at the same time how this small object like the Walkman first and then the ipod create bubble of space around we that enable we to have a metaphysical space that be much big than we physical space you can be in the subway and you can be completely isolate and have you own room in you ipod and this be the work of several designer that really enhance the idea of solitude and expansion by means of various technique this be a spa telephone the idea be that it be become so difficult to have a private conversation anywhere that you go to the spa you have a massage you have a facial maybe a rub and then you have this beautiful pool with this perfect temperature and you can have this isolation tank phone conversation with whomever you have be want to talk with for a long time and same thing here Social Tele presence it be actually already use by the military a little bit but it be the idea of be able to be somewhere else with you sen while you be remove from it physically and this be call blind date it be a unclear so if you be too shy to be really at the date you can stay at a distance with you flower and somebody else reenact the date for you Rapid manufacturing be another big area in which technology and design be I think bind to change the world you have hear about it before many time Rapid manufacturing be a computer file send directly from the computer to the manufacturing machine it use to be call rapid prototype rapid modeling it start out in the 80 but at the begin it be machine carve out of a foam block a model that be very very fragile and could not have any real use slowly but surely the material become well well resin technique become well not only carve but also stereolithography and laser solidify all kind of resin whether in powder or in liquid form and the vat become big to the point that now we can have actual chair make by rapid manufacturing it take seven day today to manufacture a chair but you know what one day it will take seven hour and then the dream be that you will be able to from home customize you chair you know company and designer will be design the matrix or the margin that respect both solidity and brand and design identity and then you can send it to the Kinko store at the cornerand go get you chair now the implication of this be enormous not only regard the participation of the final buyer in the design process but also no tracking no warehousing no waste material also I can imagine many design manufacturer will have to retool they own business plan and maybe invest in this Kinko store but it really be a big change and here I be show a picture that be in Wired Magazine you know the Artifacts of the future section that I love so much that show you can have you desktop 3d printer and print you own basketball but here instead be example you can already 3d print textile which be very interesting this be just a really nice touch it be call slow prototype it be a designer that put 10 000 bee at work and they build this vase they have a particular shape that they have to stay in Mapping and tag as the capacity of computer become really really big and the capacity of we mind not that much big we find that we need to tag as much as we can what we do in order to then retrace we path also we do it in order to share with other person again this communal sense of experience that seem to be so important today so various way to map and tag be also the work of many designer nowadays also the sen designer and scientist all work on try to expand we sen capability so that we can achieve more and also animal sen in a way this particular object that many person love so much be actually base on kind of a scientific experiment the fact that bee have a very strong olfactory sense and so much like dog that can smell certain kind of skin cancer bee can be train by pavlovian reflex to detect one type of cancer and also pregnancy and so this student at the RCA design this beautiful blown glass object where the bee move from one chamber to the other if they detect that particular smell that signify in this case pregnancy another shape be make for cancer design for debate be a very interesting new endeavor that designer have really shape for themselves some designer do not design object product thing that we be go to actually use but rather they design scenario that be object base they be still very useful they help company and other designer think good about the future and usually they be accompany by video this be quite beautiful it be Dunne and Raby all the Robots that be a series of robot that be mean to be take care of we always think that robot will take care of we and instead they design this robot that be very very needy you need to take one in you arm and look at it in the eye for about five minute before it do something another one get really really nervous if you get in to the room and start shake so you have to calm it down so it be really a way to make we think more about what robot mean to we Noam Toran and Accessories for Lonely Men the idea be that when you lose you love one or you go through a bad breakup what you miss the most be that annoying thing that you use to hate when you be with the other person so he design all this series of accessory this one be something that take away the sheet from you at night then there be another one that breathe on you neck there be another one that throw plate and break they so it be just this idea of what we really miss in life Elio Caccavale he take the idea of that doll that explain leukemia he be work on doll that explain xenotransplantation and also the spider gene into the goat from a few year ago he be work for the exhibition on a whole series of doll that explain to child where baby come from today because it be not anymore Mom Dad the flower and the bee and then there be the baby no it can be two mom three dad in vitro there be the whole idea of how baby can be make today that have change so it be a series of doll that he be work on right now one of the most beautiful thing be that designer really work on life even though they take technology into account and many designer have be work recently on the idea of death and mourning and what we can do about it today with new technology or how we should behave about it with new technology this three object over there be hard drive with a bluetooth connection but they be in reality very very beautiful sculpted artifact that contain the whole desktop and computer memory of somebody who pass away so instead of have only the picture you will be able to put this object next to the computer and all of a sudden have you know Gertrude whole life and all of she file and she address book come alive and this be even good this be Auger Loizeau AfterLife it be the idea that some person do not believe in a afterlife so to give they something tangible that show that there be something after death they take the gastric juice of person who pass away and concentrate they and put they into a battery that can actually be use to power flashlight they also go you know sex toy whatever it be quite amazing how this thing can make you smile can make you laugh can make you cry sometimes but I be hope that this particular exhibition will be able to trace a new portrait of where design be go which be always hopefully a portrait a few year in advance of where the world be go thank you very much
