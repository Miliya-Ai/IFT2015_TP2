I be a bug lover myself not from childhood by the way but rather late when I bachelor major in zoology at Tel Aviv University I kind of fall in love with bug and then within zoology I take the course or the discipline of entomology the science of insect and then I think to myself how can I be practical or help in the science of entomology and then I move to the world of plant protection plant protection from insect from bad bug and then within plant protection I come into the discipline of biological pest control which we actually define as the use of live organism to reduce population of noxious plant pest so it be a whole discipline in plant protection aim at the reduction of chemical and biological pest control by the way or this good bug that we be talk about they have exist in the world for thousand and thousand of year for a long long time but only in the last 120 year person start or person know more and more how to exploit or how to use this biological control phenomenon or in fact natural control phenomenon for they own need because biological control phenomenon you can see it in you backyard just take a magnifying glass you see what I have here that be a magnifier time 10 you just open it twist leaf and you see a whole new world of minute insect or little spider of one millimeter one and a half two millimeter long and you can distinguish between the good one and the bad one so this phenomenon of natural control exist literally everywhere here in front of this building I be sure just have a look at the plant so it be everywhere and we need to know how to exploit it well let go hand by hand and browse through just a few example what be a pest what damage do it actually inflict on the plant and what be the natural enemy the biological control agent or the good bug that we be talk about in general I be go to talk about insect and spider or mite let we call they Insects that six legged organism and spider or mite the eight legged organism let have a look at that here be a devastating pest a spider mite because it do a lot of webbing like a spider you see the mother in between and two daughter probably on the left and right and a single egg on the right hand side and then you see what kind of damage it can inflict on you right hand side you can see a cucumber leaf in the middle a cotton leaf and on the leave a tomato leaf with this little stipple they can literally turn from green to white because of the suck pierce mouth part of that spider but here come nature that provide we with a good spider this be a predatory mite just as small as a spider mite one two millimeter long not more than that run quickly hunt chase the spider mite and here you can see this lady in action on you leave hand side just pierce suck the body fluid on the left hand side of the pest mite and after five minute this be what you see just a typical dead corpse the shriveled suck out dead corpse of the spider mite and next to it two satiate individual predatory mite a mother on the left hand side a young nymph on the right hand side by the way a meal for they for 24 hour be about five of the spider mite of the bad mite and or 15 to 20 egg of the pest mite by the way they be always hungry laughter and here be another example aphid it be springtime now in Israel when temperature rise sharply you can see that bad one that aphid all over the plant in you hibiscus in you lantana in the young fresh foliage of the so call spring flush by the way with aphid you have only female like Amazons Females give rise to female give rise to other female no male at all parthenogenesis as it be so call and they be very happy with that apparently laughter here we can see the damage that aphid secrete a sticky sugary liquid call honeydew and this just clog the upper part of the plant here you see a typical cucumber leaf that turn from green to black because of a black fungus sooty mold which be cover it and here come the salvation through this parasitic wasp here we be not talk about a predator here we be talk a parasite not a two legged parasite but a eight legged parasite of course this be a parasitic wasp again two millimeter long slender a very quick and sharp flier and here you can see this parasite in action like in a acrobatic maneuver she stand vis vis in front of the victim at the right hand side bend its abdomen and insert a single egg into the body fluid of the aphid by the way the aphid try to escape she kick and bite and secrete different liquid but nothing will happen in fact only the egg of the parasitoid will be insert into the body fluid of the aphid and after a few day depend upon temperature the egg will hatch and the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside laughter this be all natural this be all natural this be not fiction nothing at all again in you backyard in you backyard laughter applause but this be the end result mummy this be the visual result of a dead aphid encompass inside a develop parasitoid that after a few minute you see halfway out the birth be almost complete you can see by the way in different movie etc it take just a few minute and if this be a female she will immediately mate with a male and off she go because time be very short this female can live only three to four day and she need to give rise to around 400 egg that mean she have 400 bad aphid to put she egg into they body fluid this be of course not the end of it there be a whole wealth of other natural enemy and this be just the last example again we will start first with the pest the thrips by the way all this weird name I do not bother you with the latin name of this creature just the popular name but this be a nice slender very bad pest if you can see this sweet pepper this be not just a exotic ornamental sweet pepper this be a sweet pepper which be not consumable because it be suffer from a viral disease transmit by that thrip adult and here come the natural enemy minute pirate bug minute because it be rather small here you can see the adult black and two young one and again in action this adult pierce the thrips suck it within just several minute go to the other prey continue all over the place and if we spread that minute pirate bug the good one for example in a sweet pepper plot they go to the flower and look this flower be flood with predatory bug with the good one after wipe out the bad one the thrips so this be a very positive situation no harm to the develop fruit no harm to the fruit set everything be just fine under this circumstance but again the question be here you see they on a one to one basis the pest the natural enemy what we do be actually this in Northeast Israel in Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu there be a facility that mass produce that natural enemy in other word what we do there be amplify the natural control or the biological control phenomenon and in 30 000 square meter of state of the art greenhouse there we be mass produce that predatory mite that minute pirate bug that parasitic wasp etc many different part by the way they have a very nice landscape you see the Jordanian mountain on the one hand and the Jordan Valley on the other hand and a good mild winter and a nice hot summer which be a excellent condition to mass produce that creature and by the way mass production it be not genetic manipulation there be no gmo genetically modify organism whatsoever we take they from nature and the only thing that we do be give they the optimal condition under the greenhouse or in the climate room in order to proliferate multiply and reproduce and that be what we get you see under a microscope you see in the upper left corner you see a single predatory mite and this be the whole bunch of predatory mite you see this ampul you see this one I have one gram of that predatory mite one gram be 80 000 individual 80 000 individual be good enough to control one acre 4 000 square meter of a strawberry plot against spider mite for the whole season of almost one year and we can produce from this believe you I several dozen of kilogram on a annual basis so this be what I call amplification of the phenomenon and no we do not disrupt the balance on the contrary because we bring it to every cultural plot where the balance be already disrupt by the chemical here we come with that natural enemy in order to reverse a little bit of the wheel and to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot by reduce that chemical that be the whole idea and what be the impact in this table you can actually see what be a impact of a successful biological control by good bug for example in Israel where we employ more than 1 000 hectare 10 000 dunam in Israeli term of biological pest control sweet pepper under protection 75 percent of the pesticide be actually reduce and Israeli strawberry even more 80 percent of the pesticide especially that aim against pest mite in strawberry so the impact be very strong and there go the question especially if you ask grower agriculturist why biological control why good bug by the way the number of answer you get equal the number of person you ask but if we go for example to this place Southeast Israel the Arava area above the Great Rift Valley where the pearl of Israeli agriculture be locate especially under greenhouse condition or under screenhouse condition if you drive all the way to Eilat you see this just in the middle of the desert and if you zoom in you can definitely watch this grandparent with they grandchild distribute the natural enemy the good bug instead of wear special clothes and gas mask and apply chemical so safety with respect to the application be the number one answer that we get from grower for why biological control number two many grower be in fact petrified by the idea of resistance that the pest will become resistant to the chemical just like in we case that bacterium become resistant to antibiotic it be the same and it can happen very quickly fortunately in either biological control or even natural control resistance be extremely rare it hardly happen because this be evolution this be the natural ratio unlike resistance which happen in the case of chemical and thirdly public demand the more the public demand the reduction of chemical the more grower become aware of the fact that they should wherever they can and wherever possible replace the chemical control with biological control even here there be another grower you see very interested in the bug the bad one and the good one wear this magnifier already on she head just walk safely in she crop finally I want to get to my vision or in fact to my dream because you see this be the reality have a look at the gap if we take the overall turnover of the biocontrol industry worldwide it be 250 million dollar and look at the overall pesticide industry in all the crop throughout the world I think it be time 100 or something like that twenty five billion so there be a huge gap to bridge so actually how can we do it how can we bridge or let say narrow this gap over the year first of all we need to find more robust good and reliable biological solution more good bug that we can either mass produce or actually conserve in the field secondly to create even more intensive and strict public demand for the reduction of chemical in agricultural fresh produce and thirdly also to increase awareness by the grower to the potential of this industry and this gap really narrow step by step it do narrow so I think my last slide be all we be say we can actually sing it give nature a chance I be say it on behalf of all the biocontrol practitioner and implementer in Israel and abroad really give nature a chance thank you applause
