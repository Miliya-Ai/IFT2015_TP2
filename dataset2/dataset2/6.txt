on September 10 the morning of my seventh birthday I come downstairs to the kitchen where my mother be wash the dish and my father be read the paper or something and I sort of present myself to they in the doorway and they say hey happy birthday and I say I be seven and my father smile and say well you know what that mean do not you and I say yeah that I be go to have a party and a cake and get a lot of present and my dad say well yes but more importantly be seven means that you have reach the age of reason and you be now capable of commit any and all sin against God and man laughter now I have hear this phrase age of reason before Sister Mary Kevin have be bandy it about my second grade class at school but when she say it the phrase seem all catch up in the excitement of preparation for we first communion and we first confession and everybody know that be really all about the white dress and the white veil and anyway I have not really pay all that much attention to that phrase age of reason so I say yeah yeah age of reason what do that mean again and my dad say well we believe in the Catholic Church that God know that little kid do not know the difference between right and wrong but when you be seven you be old enough to know well so you have grow up and reach the age of reason and now God will start keep note on you and begin you permanent record laughter and I say oh wait a minute you mean all that time up till today all that time I be so good God do not notice it and my mom say well I notice it laughter and I think how could I not have know this before how could it not have sink in when they have be tell I all that be good and no real credit for it and bad of all how could I not have realize this very important information until the very day that it be basically useless to I so I say well mom and Dad what about Santa Claus I mean Santa Claus know if you be naughty or nice right and my dad say yeah but honey I think that be technically just between Thanksgiving and Christmas and my mother say oh Bob stop it let just tell she I mean she be seven Julie there be no Santa Claus laughter now this be actually not that upsetting to I my parent have this whole elaborate story about Santa Claus how they have talk to Santa Claus himself and agree that instead of Santa deliver we present over the night of Christmas Eve like he do for every other family who get to open they surprise first thing Christmas morning we family would give Santa more time Santa would come to we house while we be at nine o clock high mass on Christmas morning but only if all of we kid do not make a fuss which make I very suspicious it be pretty obvious that it be really we parent give we the present I mean my dad have a very distinctive wrapping style and my mother handwriting be so close to Santa laughter plus why would Santa save time by have to loop back to we house after he have go to everybody else there be only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence we family be too strange and weird for even Santa Claus to come visit and my poor parent be try to protect we from the embarrassment this humiliation of rejection by Santa who be jolly but let face it he be also very judgmental so to find out that there be no Santa Claus at all be actually sort of a relief I leave the kitchen not really in shock about Santa but rather I be just dumbfounded about how I could have miss this whole age of reason thing it be too late for I but maybe I could help someone else someone who could use the information they have to fit two criterion they have to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason and not yet seven the answer be clear my brother Bill he be six well I finally find Bill about a block away from we house at this public school playground it be a Saturday and he be all by himself just kick a ball against the side of a wall I run up to he and say Bill I just realize that the age of reason start when you turn seven and then you be capable of commit any and all sin against God and man and Bill say so and I say so you be six you have a whole year to do anything you want to and God will not notice it and he say so and I say so so everything and I turn to run I be so angry with he but when I get to the top of the step I turn around dramatically and say oh by the way Bill there be no Santa Claus laughter now I do not know it at the time but I really be not turn seven on September 10th for my 13th birthday I plan a slumber party with all of my girlfriend but a couple of week beforehand my mother take I aside and say I need to speak to you privately September 10th be not you birthday it be October 10th and I say what laughter and she say laughter listen the cut off date to start kindergarten be September 15th laughter so I tell they that you birthday be September 10th and then I be not sure that you be not just go to go blab it all over the place so I start to tell you you birthday be September 10th but Julie you be so ready to start school honey you be so ready I think about it and when I be four I be already the old of four child and my mother even have another child to come so what I think she understandably really mean be that she be so ready she be so ready then she say do not worry Julie every year on October 10th when it be you birthday but you do not realize it I make sure that you eat a piece of cake that day laughter which be comforting but troubling my mother have be celebrate my birthday with I without I laughter what be so upsetting about this new piece of information be not that I have to change the date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriend what be most upsetting be that this mean I be not a Virgo I have a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom and I read my horoscope every single day and it be so totally I laughter and this mean that I be a Libra so I take the bus downtown to get the new Libra poster the Virgo poster be a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair sort of lounge by some water but the Libra poster be just a huge scale this be around the time that I start fill out physically and I be fill out a lot more than a lot of the other girl and frankly the whole idea that my astrological sign be a scale just seem ominous and depressing laughter but I get the new Libra poster and I start to read my new Libra horoscope and I be astonished to find that it be also totally I laughter it be not until year later look back on this whole age of reason change of birthday thing that it dawn on I I be not turn seven when I think I turn seven I have a whole other month to do anything I want to before God start keep tab on I oh life can be so cruel one day two mormon missionary come to my door now I just live off a main thoroughfare in Los Angeles and my block be well it be a natural beginning for person who be peddle thing door to door sometimes I get little old lady from the Seventh Day Adventist Church show I this cartoon picture of heaven and sometimes I get teenager who promise I that they will not join a gang and just start rob person if I only buy some magazine subscription from they so normally I just ignore the doorbell but on this day I answer and there stand two boy each about 19 in white starch short sleeved shirt and they have little name tag that identify they as official representative of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints and they say they have a message for I from God I say a message for I from God and they say yes now I be raise in the Pacific Northwest around a lot of Church of Latter day Saints person and you know I have work with they and even date they but I never really know the doctrine or what they say to person when they be out on a mission and I guess I be sort of curious so I say well please come in and they look really happy because I do not think this happen to they all that often laughter and I sit they down and I get they glass of water ok I get it I get it I get they glass of water do not touch my hair that be the thing laughter you can not put a video of myself in front of I and expect I not to fix my hair ok laughter so I sit they down and I get they glass of water and after nicety they say do you believe that God love you with all he heart and I think well of course I believe in God but you know I do not like that word heart because it anthropomorphize God and I do not like the word he either because that sexualize God but I do not want to argue semantics with this boy so after a very long uncomfortable pause I say yes yes I do I feel very loved and they look at each other and smile like that be the right answer and then they say do you believe that we be all brother and sister on this planet and I say yes I do and I be so relieved that it be a question I could answer so quickly and they say well then we have a story to tell you and they tell I this story all about this guy name Lehi who live in Jerusalem in 600 bc now apparently in Jerusalem in 600 bc everyone be completely bad and evil every single one of they man woman child infant fetus and God come to Lehi and say to he put you family on a boat and I will lead you out of here and God do lead they he lead they to America I say America laughter from Jerusalem to America by boat in 600 bc and they say yes laughter then they tell I how Lehi and he descendant reproduce and reproduce and over the course of 600 year there be two great race of they the Nephites and the Lamanites and the Nephites be totally good each and every one of they and the Lamanites be totally bad and evil every single one of they just bad to the bone then after Jesus die on the cross for we sin on he way up to heaven he stop by America and visit the Nephites laughter and he tell they that if they all remain totally totally good each and every one of they they would win the war against the evil Lamanites but apparently somebody blow it because the Lamanites be able to kill all the Nephites all but one guy this guy name Mormon who manage to survive by hide in the wood and he make sure this whole story be write down in reform Egyptian hieroglyphic chisel onto gold plate which he then bury near Palmyra New York laughter well I be just on the edge of my seat laughter I say what happen to the Lamanites and they say well they become we native American here in the U S and I say so you believe the native American be descend from a person who be totally evil and they say yes then they tell I how this guy name Joseph Smith find that bury gold plate right in he backyard and he also find this magic stone back there that he put into he hat and then bury he face into and this allow he to translate the gold plate from the reform Egyptian into English well at this point I just want to give this two boy some advice about they pitch laughter I want to say applause ok do not start with this story laughter I mean even the Scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start applause tell person all about Xenu the evil intergalactic overlord then they say do you believe that God speak to we through he righteous prophet and I say no I do not because I be sort of upset about this Lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story but the truth be I have not really think this through so I backpedal a little and I say well what exactly do you mean by righteous and what do you mean by prophet like could the prophet be woman and they say no and I say why and they say well it be because God give woman a gift that be so spectacular it be so wonderful that the only gift he have leave over to give man be the gift of prophecy what be this wonderful gift God give woman I wonder maybe they great ability to cooperate and adapt laughter woman long lifespan the fact that woman tend to be much less violent than man but no it be not any of this gift they say well it be she ability to bear child I say oh come on I mean even if woman try to have a baby every single year from the time they be 15 to the time they be 45 assume they do not die from exhaustion it still seem like some woman would have some time leave over to hear the word of God and they say no laughter well then they do not look so fresh faced and cute to I any more but they have more to say they say well we also believe that if you be a Mormon and if you be in good standing with the church when you die you get to go to heaven and be with you family for all eternity and I say oh dear laughter that would not be such a good incentive for I laughter and they say oh laughter Hey well we also believe that when you go to heaven you get you body restore to you in its good original state like if you would lose a leg well you get it back or if you would go blind you could see I say oh now I do not have a uterus because I have cancer a few year ago so do this mean that if I go to heaven I would get my old uterus back and they say sure and I say I do not want it back I be happy without it gosh what if you have a nose job and you like it laughter would God force you to get you old nose back then they give I this Book of Mormon tell I to read this chapter and that chapter and say they would come back and check in on I and I think I say something like please do not hurry or maybe just please do not and they be go ok so I initially feel really superior to this boy and smug in my more conventional faith but then the more I think about it the more I have to be honest with myself if someone come to my door and I be hear catholic theology and dogma for the very first time and they say we believe that God impregnate a very young girl without the use of intercourse and the fact that she be a virgin be maniacally important to we laughter and she have a baby and that be the son of God I mean I would think that be equally ridiculous I be just so used to that story laughter so I could not let myself feel condescending towards this boy but the question they ask I when they first arrive really stick in my head do I believe that God love I with all he heart because I be not exactly sure how I feel about that question now if they have ask I do you feel that God love you with all he heart well that would have be much different I think I would have instantly answer yes yes I feel it all the time I feel God love when I be hurt and confuse and I feel console and care for I take shelter in God love when I do not understand why tragedy hit and I feel God love when I look with gratitude at all the beauty I see but since they ask I that question with the word believe in it somehow it be all different because I be not exactly sure if I believe what I so clearly feel
