we have be tell to go out on a limb and say something surprising so I will try and do that but I want to start with two thing that everyone already know and the first one in fact be something that have be know for most of recorded history and that be that the planet earth or the solar system or we environment or whatever be uniquely suited to sustain we evolution or creation as it use to be think and we present existence and most important we future survival nowadays this idea have a dramatic name Spaceship Earth and the idea there be that outside the spaceship the universe be implacably hostile and inside be all we have all we depend on and we only get the one chance if we mess up we spaceship we have get nowhere else to go now the second thing that everyone already know be that contrary to what be believe for most of human history human being be not in fact the hub of existence as Stephen Hawking famously say we be just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet that be in orbit around a typical star which be on the outskirts of a typical galaxy and so on now the first of that two thing that everyone know be kind of say that we be at a very un typical place uniquely suited and so on and the second one be say that we be at a typical place and especially if you regard this two as deep truth to live by and to inform you life decision then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other but that do not prevent they from both be completely false laughter and they be so let I start with the second one typical well be this a typical place well let look around you know look in a random direction and we see a wall and chemical scum laughter and that be not typical of the universe at all all you have get to do be go a few hundred mile in that same direction and look back and you will not see any wall or chemical scum at all all you see be a blue planet and if you go further than that you will see the Sun the solar system and the star and so on but that be still not typical of the universe because star come in galaxy and most place in the universe a typical place in the universe be nowhere near any galaxy so let go out further till we be outside the galaxy and look back and yeah there be the huge galaxy with spiral arm lay out in front of we and at this point we have come 100 000 light year from here but we be still nowhere near a typical place in the universe to get to a typical place you have get to go 1 000 time as far as that into intergalactic space and so what do that look like typical what do a typical place in the universe look like well at enormous expense TED have arrange a high resolution immersion virtual reality rendering of the view from intergalactic space can we have the light off please so we can see it well not quite not quite perfect you see intergalactic space be completely dark pitch dark it be so dark that if you be to be look at the near star to you and that star be to explode as a supernova and you be to be stare directly at it at the moment when its light reach you you still would not be able to see even a glimmer that be how big and how dark the universe be and that be despite the fact that a supernova be so bright so brilliant a event that it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light year laughter and yet from intergalactic space it be so far away you would not even see it it be also very cold out there less than three degree above absolute zero and it be very empty the vacuum there be one million time less dense than the high vacuum that we good technology on Earth can currently create so that be how different a typical place be from this place and that be how un typical this place be so can we have the light back on please thank you now how do we know about a environment that be so far away and so different and so alien from anything we be use to well the Earth we environment in the form of we be create knowledge well what do that mean well look out even far than we have just be I mean from here with a telescope and you will see thing that look like star they be call quasar quasar originally mean quasi stellar object which mean thing that look a bit like star laughter but they be not star and we know what they be billion of year ago and billion of light year away the material at the center of a galaxy collapse towards a super massive black hole and then intense magnetic field direct some of the energy of that gravitational collapse and some of the matter back out in the form of tremendous jet which illuminate lobe with the brilliance of I think it be a trillion sun now the physics of the human brain could hardly be more unlike the physics of such a jet we could not survive for a instant in it Language break down when try to describe what it would be like in one of that jet it would be a bit like experience a supernova explosion but at point blank range and for million of year at a time laughter and yet that jet happen in precisely such a way that billion of year later on the other side of the universe some bit of chemical scum could accurately describe and model and predict and explain above all there be you reference what be happen there in reality the one physical system the brain contain a accurate working model of the other the quasar not just a superficial image of it though it contain that as well but a explanatory model embody the same mathematical relationship and the same causal structure now that be knowledge and if that be not amazing enough the faithfulness with which the one structure resemble the other be increase with time that be the growth of knowledge so the law of physics have this special property that physical object as unlike each other as they could possibly be can nevertheless embody the same mathematical and causal structure and to do it more and more so over time so we be a chemical scum that be different this chemical scum have universality its structure contain with ever increase precision the structure of everything this place and not other place in the universe be a hub which contain within itself the structural and causal essence of the whole of the rest of physical reality and so far from be insignificant the fact that the law of physics allow this or even mandate that this can happen be one of the most important thing about the physical world now how do the solar system we environment in the form of we acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe well one thing that be true about Stephen Hawking remark I mean it be true but it be the wrong emphasis one thing that be true about it be that it do not do it with any special physics there be no special dispensation no miracle involve it do it simply with three thing that we have here in abundance one of they be matter because the growth of knowledge be a form of information processing information processing be computation computation require a computer there be no known way of make a computer without matter we also need energy to make the computer and most important to make the media in effect onto which we record the knowledge that we discover and then thirdly less tangible but just as essential for the open ended creation of knowledge of explanation be evidence now we environment be inundate with evidence we happen to get round to testing let say Newton Law of gravity about 300 year ago but the evidence that we use to do that be fall down on every square meter of the Earth for billion of year before that and will continue to fall for billion of year afterwards and the same be true for all the other science as far as we know evidence to discover the most fundamental truth of all the science be here just for the take on we planet we location be saturate with evidence and also with matter and energy out in intergalactic space that three prerequisite for the open ended creation of knowledge be at they low possible supply as I say it be empty it be cold and it be dark out there or be it now actually that be just another parochial misconception laughter because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space the same size as we home the solar system now that cube be very empty by human standard but that still mean that it contain over a million ton of matter and a million ton be enough to make say a self contain space station on which there be a colony of scientist that be devote to create a open ended stream of knowledge and so on now it be way beyond present technology to even gather the hydrogen from intergalactic space and form it into other element and so on but the thing be in a comprehensible universe if something be not forbid by the law of physics then what could possibly prevent we from do it other than know how in other word it be a matter of knowledge not resource if we could do that we have automatically have a energy supply because this transmutation would be a fusion reactor and evidence well again it be dark out there to human sen but all you have get to do be take a telescope even one of present day design look out and you will see the same galaxy as we do from here and with a more powerful telescope you will be able to see star and planet in that galaxy you will be able to do astrophysics and learn the law of physics and locally there you could build particle accelerator and learn elementary particle physics and chemistry and so on probably the hard science to do would be biology field trip laughter because it would take several hundred million year to get to the near life bear planet and back but I have to tell you and sorry Richard but I never do like biology field trip much laughter and I think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million year laughter so in fact intergalactic space do contain all the prerequisite for the open ended creation of knowledge any such cube anywhere in the universe could become the same kind of hub that we be if the knowledge of how to do so be present there so we be not in a uniquely hospitable place if intergalactic space be capable of create a open ended stream of explanation then so be almost every other environment so be the Earth so be a polluted Earth and the limit factor there and here be not resource because they be plentiful but knowledge which be scarce now this cosmic knowledge base view may and I think ought to make we feel very special but it should also make we feel vulnerable because it mean that without the specific knowledge that be need to survive the ongoing challenge of the universe we will not survive they all it take be for a supernova to go off a few light year away and we will all be dead Martin Rees have recently write a book about we vulnerability to all sort of thing from astrophysics to scientific experiment go wrong and most importantly to terrorism with weapon of mass destruction and he think that civilization have only a 50 percent chance of survive this century I think he be go to talk about that later in the conference now I do not think that probability be the right category to discuss this issue in but I do agree with he about this we can survive and we can fail to survive but it depend not on chance but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time the danger be not at all unprecedented species go extinct all the time Civilizations end the overwhelming majority of all species and all civilization that have ever exist be now history and if we want to be the exception to that then logically we only hope be to make use of the one feature that distinguish we species and civilization from all the other namely we special relationship with the law of physics we ability to create new explanation new knowledge to be a hub of existence so let I now apply this to a current controversy not because I want to advocate any particular solution but just to illustrate the kind of thing I mean and the controversy be global warming now I be a physicist but I be not the right kind of physicist in regard to global warming I be just a layman and the rational thing for a layman to do be to take seriously the prevail scientific theory and accord to that theory it be already too late to avoid a disaster because if it be true that we good option at the moment be to prevent co2 emission with something like the Kyoto Protocol with its constraint on economic activity and its enormous cost of hundred of billion of dollar or whatever it be then that be already a disaster by any reasonable measure and the action that be advocate be not even purport to solve the problem merely to postpone it by a little so it be already too late to avoid it and it probably have be too late to avoid it ever since before anyone realize the danger it be probably already too late in the 1970 when the good available scientific theory be tell we that industrial emission be about to precipitate a new ice age in which billion would die now the lesson of that seem clear to I and I do not know why it be not inform public debate it be that we can not always know when we know of a impending disaster and how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself then there be not go to be much argument really but no precaution and no precautionary principle can avoid problem that we do not yet foresee hence we need a stance of problem fix not just problem avoidance and it be true that a ounce of prevention equal a pound of cure but that be only if we know what to prevent if you have be punch on the nose then the science of medicine do not consist of teach you how to avoid punch laughter if medical science stop seek cure and concentrate on prevention only then it would achieve very little of either the world be buzz at the moment with plan to force reduction in gas emission at all cost it ought to be buzz with plan to reduce the temperature and with plan to live at the high temperature and not at all cost but efficiently and cheaply and some such plan exist thing like swarm of mirror in space to deflect the sunlight away and encourage aquatic organism to eat more carbon dioxide at the moment this thing be fringe research they be not central to the human effort to face this problem or problem in general and with problem that we be not aware of yet the ability to put right not the sheer good luck of avoid indefinitely be we only hope not just of solve problem but of survival so take two stone tablet and carve on they on one of they carve problem be soluble and on the other one carve problem be inevitable thank you applause
