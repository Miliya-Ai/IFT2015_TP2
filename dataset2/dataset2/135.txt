now have any of y all ever look up this word you know in a dictionary laughter yeah that be what I think how about this word here I will show it to you Lexicography the practice of compile dictionary notice we be very specific that word compile the dictionary be not carve out of a piece of granite out of a lump of rock it be make up of lot of little bit it be little discrete that be spell d i s c r e t e bit and that bit be word now one of the perk of be a lexicographer besides get to come to TED be that you get to say really fun word like lexicographical Lexicographical have this great pattern it be call a double dactyl and just by say double dactyl I have send the geek needle all the way into the red laughter applause but lexicographical be the same pattern as higgledy piggledy right it be a fun word to say and I get to say it a lot now one of the non perk of be a lexicographer be that person do not usually have a kind of warm fuzzy snuggly image of the dictionary right nobody hug they dictionary but what person really often think about the dictionary is they think more like this just to let you know I do not have a lexicographical whistle but person think that my job be to let the good word make that difficult left hand turn into the dictionary and keep the bad word out but the thing be I do not want to be a traffic cop for one thing I just do not do uniform and for another decide what word be good and what word be bad be actually not very easy and it be not very fun and when part of you job be not easy or fun you kind of look for a excuse not to do they so if I have to think of some kind of occupation as a metaphor for my work I would much rather be a fisherman I want to throw my big net into the deep blue ocean of English and see what marvelous creature I can drag up from the bottom but why do person want I to direct traffic when I would much rather go fish well I blame the queen why do I blame the Queen Well first of all I blame the queen because it be funny but secondly I blame the queen because dictionary have really not change we idea of what a dictionary is have not change since she reign the only thing that Queen Victoria would not be amuse by in modern dictionary be we inclusion of the F word which have happen in American dictionary since 1965 so there be this guy right Victorian era James Murray first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary I do not have that hat I wish I have that hat so he be really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionary today when a guy who look like that in that hat be the face of modernity you have a problem and so James Murray could get a job on any dictionary today there would be virtually no learning curve and of course a few of we be say okay computer computer what about computer the thing about computer be I love computer I mean I be a huge geek I love computer I would go on a hunger strike before I let they take away Google Book search from I but computer do not do much else other than speed up the process of compile dictionary they do not change the end result because what a dictionary is be it be Victorian design merge with a little bit of modern propulsion it be steampunk what we have be a electric velocipede you know we have Victorian design with a engine on it that be all the design have not change and ok what about online dictionary right online dictionary must be different this be the Oxford English Dictionary Online one of the good online dictionary this be my favorite word by the way erinaceous pertain to the hedgehog family of the nature of a hedgehog very useful word so look at that online dictionary right now be paper throw up on a screen this be flat look how many link there be in the actual entry two right that little button I have they all expand except for the date chart so there be not very much go on here there be not a lot of clickiness and in fact online dictionary replicate almost all the problem of print except for searchability and when you improve searchability you actually take away the one advantage of print which be serendipity serendipity be when you find thing you be not look for because find what you be look for be so damned difficult so laughter applause now when you think about this what we have here be a ham butt problem do everyone know the ham butt problem woman make a ham for a big family dinner she go to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away and she look at this piece of ham and she be like this be a perfectly good piece of ham why be I throw this away she think well my mom always do this so she call up mom and she say mom why would you cut the butt off the ham when you be make a ham she say I do not know my mom always do it so they call grandma and grandma say my pan be too small laughter so it be not that we have good word and bad word we have a pan that be too small you know that ham butt be delicious there be no reason to throw it away the bad word see when person think about a place and they do not find a place on the map they think this map suck when they find a nightspot or a bar and it be not in the guidebook they be like Ooh this place must be cool it be not in the guidebook when they find a word that be not in the dictionary they think this must be a bad word why it be more likely to be a bad dictionary why be you blame the ham for be too big for the pan so you can not get a small ham the English language be as big as it be so if you have a ham butt problem and you be think about the ham butt problem the conclusion that it lead you to be inexorable and counterintuitive paper be the enemy of word how can this be I mean I love book I really love book some of my good friend be book but the book be not the good shape for the dictionary now they be go to think oh boy person be go to take away my beautiful paper dictionary no there will still be paper dictionary when we have car when car become the dominant mode of transportation we do not round up all the horse and shoot they you know there be still go to be paper dictionary but it be not go to be the dominant dictionary the book shape dictionary be not go to be the only shape dictionary come in and it be not go to be the prototype for the shape dictionary come in so think about it this way if you have get a artificial constraint artificial constraint lead to arbitrary distinction and a skewed worldview what if biologist could only study animal that make person go Aww Right what if we make aesthetic judgment about animal and only the one we think be cute be the one that we could study we would know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna and not very much about much else and I think this be a problem I think we should study all the word because when you think about word you can make beautiful expression from very humble part lexicography be really more about material science we be study the tolerance of the material that you use to build the structure of you expression you speech and you write and then often person say to I well ok how do I know that this word be real they think ok if we think word be the tool that we use to build the expression of we think how can you say that screwdriver be good than hammer how can you say that a sledgehammer be good than a ball peen hammer they be just the right tool for the job and so person say to I how do I know if a word be real you know anybody who be read a child book know that love make thing real if you love a word use it that make it real be in the dictionary be a artificial distinction it do not make a word any more real than any other way if you love a word it become real so if we be not worry about direct traffic if we have transcend paper if we be worry less about control and more about description then we can think of the English language as be this beautiful mobile and any time one of that little part of the mobile change be touch any time you touch a word you use it in a new context you give it a new connotation you verb it you make the mobile move you do not break it it be just in a new position and that new position can be just as beautiful now if you be no long a traffic cop the problem with be a traffic cop be there can only be so many traffic cop in any one intersection or the car get confused right but if you goal be no long to direct the traffic but maybe to count the car that go by then more eyeball be good you can ask for help if you ask for help you get more done and we really need help Library of Congress 17 million book of which half be in English if only one out of every 10 of that book have a word that be not in the dictionary in it that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionary and I find a un dictionaried word a word like un dictionary for example in almost every book I read what about newspaper newspaper archive go back to 1759 58 1 million newspaper page if only one in 100 of that page have a un dictionaried word on it it would be a entire other oe that be 500 000 more word so that be a lot and I be not even talk about magazine I be not talk about blog and I find more new word on BoingBoing in a give week than I do Newsweek or Time there be a lot go on there and I be not even talk about polysemy which be the greedy habit some word have of take more than one meaning for themselves so if you think of the word set a set can be a badger burrow a set can be one of the pleat in a Elizabethan ruff and there be one numbered definition in the OED the OED have 33 different numbered definition for set tiny little word 33 numbered definition one of they be just label miscellaneous technical sen do you know what that say to I that say to I it be Friday afternoon and somebody want to go down the pub laughter that be a lexicographical cop out to say miscellaneous technical sen so we have all this word and we really need help and the thing be we could ask for help ask for help be not that hard I mean lexicography be not rocket science see I just give you a lot of word and a lot of number and this be more of a visual explanation if we think of the dictionary as be the map of the English language this bright spot be what we know about and the dark spot be where we be in the dark if that be the map of all the word in American English we do not know very much and we do not even know the shape of the language if this be the dictionary if this be the map of American English look we have a kind of lumpy idea of Florida but there be no California we be miss California from American English we just do not know enough and we do not even know that we be miss California we do not even see that there be a gap on the map so again lexicography be not rocket science but even if it be rocket science be be do by dedicated amateur this day you know it can not be that hard to find some word so enough scientist in other discipline be really ask person to help and they be do a good job of it for instance there be ebird where amateur birdwatcher can upload information about they bird sighting and then ornithologist can go and help track population migration etc and there be this guy Mike Oates Mike Oates live in the U K he be a director of a electroplating company he be find more than 140 comet he be find so many comet they name a comet after he it be kind of out past Mars it be a hike I do not think he be get he picture take there anytime soon but he find 140 comet without a telescope he download datum from the NASA SOHO satellite and that be how he find they if we can find comet without a telescope should not we be able to find word now y all know where I be go with this because I be go to the internet which be where everybody go and the internet be great for collect word because the internet full of collector and this be a little known technological fact about the internet but the internet be actually make up of word and enthusiasm and word and enthusiasm actually happen to be the recipe for lexicography be not that great so there be a lot of really good word collect site out there right now but the problem with some of they be that they be not scientific enough they show the word but they do not show any context where do it come from who say it what newspaper be it in what book because a word be like a archaeological artifact if you do not know the provenance or the source of the artifact it be not science it be a pretty thing to look at so a word without its source be like a cut flower you know it be pretty to look at for a while but then it die it die too fast so this whole time I have be say the dictionary the dictionary the dictionary the dictionary not a dictionary or dictionary and that be because well person use the dictionary to stand for the whole language they use it synecdochically and one of the problem of know a word like synecdochically be that you really want a excuse to say synecdochically this whole talk have just be a excuse to get I to the point where I could say synecdochically to all of you so I be really sorry but when you use a part of something like the dictionary be a part of the language or a flag stand for the United States it be a symbol of the country then you be use it synecdochically but the thing be we could make the dictionary the whole language if we get a big pan then we can put all the word in we can put in all the meaning do not everyone want more mean in they life and we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language we can make it be the whole language you see what I be really hope for be that my son who turn seven this month I want he to barely remember that this be the form factor that dictionary use to come in this be what dictionary use to look like I want he to think of this kind of dictionary as a eight track tape it be a format that die because it be not useful enough it be not really what person need and the thing be if we can put in all the word no longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad we can really describe the language like scientist we can leave the aesthetic judgment to the writer and the speaker if we can do that then I can spend all my time fishing and I do not have to be a traffic cop anymore thank you very much for you kind attention
